However, this attractive, sought-after fish is one of the more demanding members of the Acanthurus genus and is suitable for advanced aquarists only. The aquarium must be spacious, mature, have a vigorous water flow, and contain plenty of live rock which the Achilles Tang will enjoy grazing upon. Include plenty of hiding places that are large enough for your fish to retreat into quickly should it feel threatened, at the same time aiming for an aquascape that allows plenty of open swimming space along the front of the aquarium for such a powerful swimmer. Achilles Tangs are not usually overly aggressive towards tankmates (although rogue specimens have been known), however they will show much hostility towards their own kind and towards other tangs - particularly other members of the Acanthurus genus - so for this reason it is best to house just one specimen per tank and not with any other tangs. It is recommended that the Achilles Tang is the last addition to a set up, as it can be a little territorial to newcomers, especially similar fish species. It is best to source a medium sized specimen (i.e. over 4" in length) as they are more likely to acclimatise well to life in captivity. Conversely, extra large specimens may have a difficult time settling in, so aim for a healthy-looking fish that is neither too small nor excessively large. Avoid any specimens that appear "pinched" in the belly area, and do ask your retailer to show you that your chosen fish is feeding well prior to purchase. Achilles Tangs have a high metabolism and require small frequent feeds throughout the day. Powerful filtration/circulation and a high level of oxygenation are therefore essential for this energetic, voracious eater. Be sure to keep on top of water quality as this fish will not tolerate deteriorating water conditions. A large refugium with living rock can be most useful: macroalgae can be cultured on this rock and these pieces rotated with pieces from the main tank, so that the Achilles Tang has a continual supply of natural foodstuffs to graze upon. Take care when handling this species, as the caudal spines are large and can inflict a very painful wound. A period of quarantine can be a valuable procedure for the acclimatisation of all livestock, and it is of particular importance for the Achilles Tang which can be fairly susceptible to developing marine whitespot. This can be difficult to treat in the reef aquarium. Ideally the fish should be quarantined and carefully observed in a separate aquarium for at least a fortnight before being introduced into your main display tank. May also be seen on sale as the Red Tail Tang. Juvenile fish display an orange caudal peduncle spine; the large orange teardrop marking in this area appearing as the fish mature. In the wild, the Achilles Tang has been known to hybridise with the Gold Rim Tang (A. nigricans). ***Prior to purchase, please bear in mind that the Achilles Tang is a very demanding species that requires an aquarium planned around its well-being; the tang should be made the centrepiece of the tank, with all the other variables worked around to suit its specific needs. Experienced aquarists only***',feeding:"Feed a varied diet for omnivores, with a large vegetable component, in small amounts several times per day. Although this species will browse on algae within the aquarium, its diet must be supplemented with frozen herbivore rations, green marine flake, Spirulina (blue-green algae), Spirulina-enriched brineshrimp, cucumber, courgette, lettuce, broccoli, Nori (dried seaweed) etc. It will also take meaty frozen foods such as Mysis, but be sure that it is receiving enough green food to help prevent HLLE.

Provide the African Blenny with a mature tank that contains an abundance of live rock, so that it may continually graze upon it for small crustaceans; without such quantity of well-established rockwork, these fish will not fare very well. It is best to keep just one specimen per tank, unless you can acquire a known mated pair, as these fish can be a little territorial in the confines of the average aquarium.

Acreichthys tomentosus is known from weedy rubble zones on shallow coral reefs, seagrass beds, and seaweed-rich sandy inshore areas, to depths of 15m (49ft). This is a fish that has an appetite for pest anemones (Aiptasia spp.) but in the wild, feeds primarily on amphipods, molluscs, and polychaetes, along with some plant matter. These well-camouflaged fish will indeed eat Aiptasia, but older specimens may also pick on coral polyps, and for this reason they are not considered totally reef safe. However, in a vast system with an abundance of fast-growing corals, and if the fish are kept well-fed, this may not be so much of an issue. In smaller quarters though, they are more suited to a fish-only set-up. A safer option for the natural eradication of Aiptasia in reef aquaria would be Peppermint Shrimps (Lysmata wurdemanni). A. tomentosus is a shy, peaceful species that can be kept alongside other fish of similar size and temperament but may lose out to more aggressive feeders in some communities. Tank bred fish are offered with increasing regularity and are often reared from an early age on a diet that features nuisance anemones to ensure they recognise these as food.

Feeding

Offer a varied diet for omnivores. Meaty items should include krill, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, finely chopped cockle/ mussel/ prawns/ squid/ fish/clam meat etc, and herbivore rations such Nori, marine algae, vegetable matter etc. Feed small amounts 3 times per day.

Definitely avoid housing with any small, timid fish or hesitant feeders. The aquarium must be mature and should include ample rockwork, arranged so that there is an abundance of small caves, crevices, channels, and overhangs that provide safe, shady retreats for this species. If the aquarium is very spacious, and has plenty of visual barriers amongst the decor, more than one specimen may be kept together if of the same size and introduced simultaneously - however do observe very carefully and separate if necessary. Do not keep with other members of the same genus. Will prey on ornamental shrimps, small/docile fish, fanworms, and bristleworms of all sizes (even those much larger than itself). The Arabian Dottyback should be the last fish added to the aquarium, otherwise it will show much aggression towards any newcomers introduced into what it perceives as its established domain.

The male then drives the female away and takes on paternal care of the adhesive eggs, gently fanning them with his pectoral fins and even picking them up and moving them to a new location if he feels they are in danger. The eggs should hatch within 3-6 days (temperature dependent) and they remain in a larval state for around 30 days. As soon as the eggs hatch, parental care ceases, so you will need to separate the young from the parents and any other fish in the tank just prior to this event. Raising the larvae to adult fish is possible, but very challenging - you will need a ready supply of miniscule foodstuffs such as rotifers available at all times and water quality/tank hygiene must be continually monitored.

Here they may be found forming loose aggregations in the mid to upper reaches of steep drop offs, feeding on zooplankton and various marine plants and algae. Juvenile fish are mostly grey with a few bright blue spots distributed over the flanks and tail, along with blue lips. Adults are very imposing fish - they develop a convexly rounded, prominent snout (this being much less of a 'horn' than is seen in the majority of unicornfish), vertical blue lines that break up into small blue spots dorsally, in addition to a broad blue band extending from underneath the eye to the front of the rostral protuberance, and long flowing caudal streamers. Interestingly, these fish have the ability to show or hide their vivid blue markings, depending on mood. The Bignose Unicornfish is a very active, semi-aggressive acanthurid that requires a great deal of swimming space. Adults have been known to grow to almost two feet long, including the long flowing tail filaments. If you are blessed with a system of enormous proportions, the Bignose Unicornfish could make a wonderful centrepiece. The tank should contain plenty of live rock which this fish will enjoy grazing upon. Include plenty of hiding places that are large enough for the Bignose Unicornfish to retreat into quickly should it feel threatened, at the same time aiming for an aquascape that allows plenty of open swimming space along the front of the aquarium for such a powerful swimmer. Bignose Unicornfish are moderately aggressive towards tankmates, especially their own kind; for this reason it is best to house just one specimen per tank. There are good reports of this fish mixing with tangs of other genera; however it is recommended that the Bignose Unicornfish is the last addition to a set up, as it can be rather territorial to newcomers, especially similar fish species. It is best to source a medium sized specimen (i.e. over 4" in length) as they are more likely to acclimatise well to life in captivity. Conversely, extra large specimens may have a difficult time settling in, so aim for a healthy-looking fish that is neither too small nor excessively large. Avoid any specimens that appear "pinched" in the belly area, and do ask your retailer to show you that your chosen fish is feeding well prior to purchase. Bignose Unicornfish have a high metabolism and require small frequent feeds throughout the day. Powerful filtration/vigorous circulation and a high level of oxygenation are therefore essential for this energetic, voracious eater. Be sure to keep on top of water quality as this fish will not tolerate deteriorating water conditions. A large refugium with living rock can be most useful: macroalgae can be cultured on this rock and these pieces rotated with pieces from the main tank, so that the Bignose Unicornfish has a continual supply of natural foodstuffs to graze upon. Take care when handling Bignose Unicornfish, as their caudal spines (2 on each side of the caudal peduncle) are particularly large and can inflict very painful wounds. A period of quarantine can be a valuable procedure for the acclimatisation of all livestock, and it is of particular importance for the Bignose Unicornfish which can be fairly susceptible to developing marine whitespot. This can be difficult to treat in the reef aquarium.

This fish is similar in appearance to the Scopas Tang (Z. scopas), and in the wild where their ranges overlap, hybrids between the two occur. The Black Tang should be provided with a generously sized tank, as ample swimming space is required, and specimens kept in smaller quarters can become quite aggressive. It is best to keep to just this one species of Zebrasoma in the aquarium, as they don't often accept other members of the same genus. Other tangs from different genera (such as the Regal Tang or Lipstick Tang) with a visibly different appearance may be accepted if the fish are added simultaneously. The tank should be mature with plenty of algal growth for these herbivores to browse. It is of utmost importance that they receive an appropriate diet consisting of a variety of greenfoods, in order to prevent Head & Lateral Line Erosion (HHLE). As long as this fish is kept well fed, it should not pose any problems in a reef set up. Occasional specimens have been known to nip at stony corals, and even some soft corals, but this is not the norm. A decent current and highly oxygenated conditions will serve this fish well. Provide plenty of hiding/sleeping places amongst the rockwork, with an open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. May also be seen on sale as the Black Longnose Tang or Black Sailfin Tang.

Angelfish from the Chaetodontoplus genus are not seen in the trade all that regularly, and many species are highly prized amongst serious hobbyists. The Black Velvet Angelfish, as the common name suggests, is predominantly black but with a variable-sized splash of grey on the face and the anterior upper half of the body. The top of the head is adorned with orange-yellow markings, and the tail and posterior of the dorsal and the anal fin are bright yellow. Juvenile fish sport a pale yellow curved bar just behind the eye and over the gill cover, and the yellow accents on the dorsal and anal fins are much bolder. Tankmates must be chosen carefully as this fish will be reluctant to feed if there is competition from boisterous or aggressive species. Keep only one Black Velvet Angelfish per tank, and not with any other angelfish. The more hiding places within the tank, the more likely it will be that this fish will feel safe enough to swim out and about in full view whilst browsing on the aquarium decor for filamentous algae and diatoms. Caution is advised when adding the Black Velvet Angelfish to reef aquaria, as selected invertebrates may be nipped at; success is more likely in XXL reef systems where the fish is less likely to cause such irreparable damage, although there are absolutely no guarantees.

Here they occur singly or in large aggregations, feeding on filamentous algae growing from the reef structures. Although apparently rather abundant in its natural habitat, this highly sought-after fish is rarely seen in the trade, and as such, tends to command a very high price tag when it is available. These striking fish sport 12 dark vertical bars on the silvery body (4 on the head, 6 on the flanks beneath the dorsal fin - which are notably broader dorsally than ventrally, and 2 on the caudal peduncle) along with several dark spots or blotches on the anterior ventral region, and a sharp spine on the caudal peduncle. This semi-aggressive, active species attains a good size and can be rather territorial, so a spacious aquarium is therefore required. It is usually best to keep only one per tank, unless the system is vast and there is an abundance of visual barriers. If you wish to keep other tangs in the same tank, it is best to opt for Ctenochaetus, Naso, or Zebrasoma species - added simultaneously - as these will be best tolerated by the Black-barred Tang, rather than other fish from the same genus (Acanthurus). However, personalities do vary between individuals, so observe your fish very carefully to ensure that there are no problems. Generally speaking, this fish is safe in reef aquaria, although occasional specimens have been known to nip at LPS corals if underfed. The Black-barred Tang will actively browse on filamentous algae growing on the decor, so a mature tank is essential for its wellbeing. Arrange the live rock to create a sloping reef, with plenty of boltholes for the fish, Be sure to leave a large open swimming area along the front of the aquarium. Vigorous filtration and circulation is a must for this energetic, voracious eater. Take care when handling, as the caudal spines can inflict a painful wound.

Blue Neon Gobies are regularly observed servicing fish that have ectoparasites, helping to control diseases such as Lymphocystis and marine white spot. An advantage over most other cleaner fishes is that the Blue Neon Goby is not an "obligate cleaner" (i.e.it does not rely on cleaning/eating parasites for optimal health). As such, it will do just as well in a healthy aquarium where it is offered quality commercially prepared foodstuffs. This diminutive goby rarely shows aggression towards other species, although it will fight with members of its own kind, especially in smaller aquaria where space and territories are more limited. Large groups (7+) can be kept if the system is spacious; however smaller aquaria it is advisable to keep either a single specimen or a known mated pair. Although these gobies cannot be sexed externally, it is often fairly easy to pick out a compatible pair at your local aquarium store as they may have paired off and be resting very close to one another. With regards to compatibility, Blue Neon Gobies are ideal for community reef aquaria; they are also often purported to coexist with a number of unlikely large predators, which usually tend to leave the gobies alone on account of their known cleaning services. However, much caution is necessary as all fish vary in personality and temperament and there can be no guarantees when it comes to their safety with such tankmates present. Observe carefully and if in any doubt, do not add them to your aquarium. It is not advisable to add Blue Neon Gobies to an aquarium containing predatory crabs.

If you wish to raise a larger number of fry, offer the pair a spawning medium such as a short section of small-diameter pvc pipe, and once the eggs have been laid/fertilised, the pipe and eggs can be carefully moved to a separate aquarium (with identical water conditions) where they will be safe from predation. You will need to ensure that the eggs are very gently aerated in the absence of the parent fish. The time it takes for the eggs to hatch will vary depending on water temperature and other factors, but on average this is usually around 8 days.

The waters in this area are somewhat colder than the waters where most popular tropical marine fish are collected, and this must be taken into account if planning to keep this species in the home aquarium; a means of chilling the water will certainly be necessary throughout the warmer months. Blue Spotted Jawfish make a fascinating addition to mature reef aquaria, providing that a few key requirements (including the aforementioned low water temperature) are met. These industrious bottom dwellers need a mixed substrate that is at least 10cm (3.9") deep. Ideally this will be comprised of 75% coral sand, and 25% small pieces of reef rubble (varying from approx. 0.5cm to 1.5cm in diameter). This will allow to the fish to construct a burrow, in which it will spend much time resting just inside the entrance, seemingly watching the world go by and waiting for food morsels to drift past overhead. At other times it will be busy rearranging things in and around its little tunnel, which can be very entertaining to observe. At night they sometimes close the entrance of the burrow with a larger pebble as they reverse in. The aquarium must have a tight fitting cover, as these fish will jump, and lighting should always be turned on gradually so as not to startle your fish. Their constant excavation and digging means that powerful filtration and water movement is prerequisite. Blue Spotted Jawfish may be kept in small groups if you have a vast set-up; in fact they often do better this way, but do ensure that there is adequate space for them all to construct their homes (in the wild they may live as close as 90cm to one another). Ideally all will be introduced at the same time to eliminate any territorial issues. If the aquarium is on the smaller side, it really is better to keep a single specimen or a known mated pair (although bear in mind the tank must have floor space of at least 3ft x 2ft to keep just one of these fish comfortably, 5ft+ for more than one specimen). Tankmates, if desired, should be small and docile and enjoy the same coolwater conditions. This species may also be seen on sale as Rosenblatt's Jawfish. To sum up: the Blue Spotted Jawfish is a very interesting and attractive fish, and will do very well in the home aquarium if provided with the right environment; however, it cannot be emphasised enough that they are temperate and not tropical.

These beautiful, multicoloured fish are easy to keep, but a spacious aquarium is a necessity, as they are active, grow large, and are powerful swimmers. Ideally, there will also be plenty of rockwork and a sand substrate that is 3-4" deep, to provide resting places for your wrasse. Provide clean, well-oxygenated water with areas of fast current. This is a fairly boisterous species that should only be kept alongside fish of similar size and temperament. Blueheaded Wrasses are protogynous sequential hermaphrodites and there are three primary phases, their colour and size depending on whether they are terminal phase (TP) males, initial phase (IP) males, or females. TP males are also known as "supermales" and have blue heads and green bodies. Three vertical stripes (black, white, black) divide the colours of the head and body, and these fish are generally of a large size. IP males and females are much smaller and have two colour forms. One type, known from reef areas, has a yellow upper half of the body with a slight greeny-black area and a white lower half; the other type, from inshore non-reef regions, is white both above and below the dark area. A dark spot is found on the anterior dorsal fin of both types of IP males and females. IP males and females have the ability to change into TP males and this switch includes a dramatic change of size and coloration. Once transformed from IP male or female to TP male, the change is permanent. It should be noted that in the aquarium, TP males are particularly territorial. Well-fed specimens should not harm corals, but they will prey on shrimps, snails, serpent stars, bristleworms, and small fish. It is best to make this species the last addition to the tank, so that it is less likely to harass any newcomers. Will jump from an open-topped aquarium.',feeding:"Carnivorous.

Juvenile fish tend to stay inshore close to small rubbly outcrops, whereas adults tend to frequent deeper reefs and shipwrecks, where they may be observed feeding on corals, crustaceans, dead fish, molluscs, sea urchins, and tunicates. These fish are best suited to a boisterous fish-only set-up. It is not unusual for these fish to attain over 18", so the aquarium must be especially spacious (wide as well as long, to allow the fish a good turning circle). This will also enable you to aquascape the tank with a good quantity of live rock which will provide refuges for the triggerfish when resting or if startled, whilst still being able to maintain a decent amount of open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Ensure that all decor is secure as these fish are more than capable of rearranging things to their liking. Also be aware that triggerfish are notorious for biting through tubing, and even heaters, so it is worth thinking very carefully about where you place your equipment. Powerful filtration and vigorous water movement are absolutely essential for the wellbeing of this energetic fish. Due to a very belligerent and highly territorial nature, keep only one specimen per tank, and not with any other Triggerfish species. Smaller fish will end up on the menu, so only choose tankmates of similar size and disposition (i.e. large, boisterous fish that can hold their own). It has been reported that divers tend to stay respectfully clear of this species in the wild due to their fearless, aggressive nature. Juveniles that are under 5cm in length sport a yellowish colouration with dark saddles and numerous wavy lines on the body. As the fish mature, these dark saddles are lost, the flanks become yellow-brown, and the fish become covered in a network of brilliant blue lines which become increasingly interconnected with growth. Although these curious, intelligent triggerfish often become "hand tame" and beg for food whilst making grunting noises, it is not advisable to feed directly from your hands as the fingers could easily be mistaken for a meaty snack. Always keep a close eye on where the fish is when carrying out any maintenance in the tank. As with many of the Balistid species, personalities of these fish can be quite varied. A new added specimen may be a little shy at first, but it will soon gain confidence as it grows.

Whilst the shrimp is working, it maintains antennal contact with its goby partner posted at the entrance of the shared burrow. If the shrimp detects the quivering motion of the goby"™s caudal fin during an unusual situation, it reacts by immediately withdrawing into the depths of the burrow. The entrance to the shared burrow will be closed at night, and only one entrance is usually open at any one time. The shrimp will only emerge from the burrow whilst it can have tactile contact with the goby. Provided with a reasonable depth of coral sand and a good selection of loose coral rubble pieces that vary in size (not too big to be moved) these gobies can do very well in the home aquarium.

The Bluespot Goby is a territorial species, and larger specimens will think nothing of attacking other gobies and even smaller, unrelated species such as wrasses and assessors. However, it is much less likely to be antagonistic if housed in spacious aquaria with plenty of visual barriers (although do remember to include large, open expanses of substrate), and where it is one of the last fishes added to the tank. Hostility normally initially takes the form of jaw gaping, fin flaring, and sideways shoving, but if it is allowed to escalate, real damage may ensue if the goby takes a bite at its adversary, so do observe very carefully. It is best to keep only one specimen per tank unless you can acquire a mated male-female pair, as conspecifics will fight. These gobies are considered reef safe as they will not harm sessile invertebrates, but be aware that they will predate on small, ornamental shrimps and small bristleworms. Ensure that the tank has tight fitting coverslides, as these gobies are accomplished jumpers. May also be seen on sale as Bluespotted Shrimp Goby.

Feeding

Will consume a wide range of meaty fare including Mysis shrimp, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, finely chopped krill/prawns etc. If reluctant to feed at first, use a turkey baster to direct some food lower down in the tank to where the goby may be hiding in its burrow. Feed small amounts 3 times per day.

Once released, the miniscule fry are free-swimming, but at great risk from predation by the adults. A nursery tank and a supply of rotifers (later freshly hatched baby brineshrimp) will be necessary. The free-swimming fry have little in the way of a yolk sac and will need to be provided with food immediately.`,overview:{Synonyms:"Doryichthys californiensis, D. excisus, D. melanopleura, D. pleurotaenia, Doryrhamphus californiensis, D. melanopleura, D. pleurotaenia, Microphis extensus, M. mayottae, M. melanopleura, M. pleurotaenia, Syngnathus melanopleura",Distribution:"Indo-Pacific",MaxiumumSize:'7cm (2.8")',Temperature:"Tropical: 23-27°C",WaterParameters:"SG: 1.020-1.025, pH: 8.1-8.4",Compatibility:"Specialist community; Reef.",Lighting:"No special requirements","Reef Aquarium Compatibility":"Will not harm invertebrates.

Juvenile fish frequent protected, shallow reef flats during the summer months, with adults swimming in deeper areas, either as solitary fish or in small aggregations of 3-15 individuals. This is an omnivorous species, feeding mostly on benthic invertebrates, especially polychaete worms, plus stony coral polyps and various algae. This somewhat shy species is regarded as moderately hardy, but is best suited to experienced aquarists. A good-sized, mature system is requisite, along with ample live rock for the fish to browse upon/hide amongst and a large open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Medium sized specimens tend to acclimatise better to aquarium life, adapting much more quickly to various prepared foods, so try to choose a healthy, alert specimen around 7.5cm (3") in length. Smaller sized fish may be very reluctant to feed, and larger specimens can sometimes be rather finicky, requiring faultless water conditions. An aquarium that has some areas of lush filamentous algae growth will also aid your new fish in settling into its new surroundings; however, as with other butterflyfish species, these fish demand excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of brisk current. Some aquarists have successfully kept the Bluestriped Butterflyfish alongside some of the more noxious soft corals, but this is something of a risk, and they should be observed carefully. Stony corals and many other sessile invertebrates will be constantly nipped at, so unfortunately must be avoided. Keep only one Bluestriped Butterflyfish per tank (unless a mated pair is acquired) and not with any other butterflyfish as they will squabble over territories. Whilst they can be rather shy when first introduced, providing them with ample retreats amongst the live rock should ensure they quickly gain confidence and venture out into the open. Tankmates should be of similar size and temperament; it is imperative that boisterous companions are avoided if this fish is to settle in and feed. The colouration and markings of the Bluestriped Butterflyfish are fairly distinctive, with well-settled individuals displaying a vibrant yellow background colour and thin blue stripes running diagonally over the body from the snout. Unusually, there is no 'mask' over the eye, a trait common in most (but not all) butterflyfish. There is a small black spot on the top of the head area, and a larger black blotch just in front of the caudal peduncle, the latter of which is thought to aid in confusing predators.

This fish belongs to the family Serranidae (the sea basses, groupers, and fairy basslets) and is one of around 30 species of reef basslets currently classified within the Liopropoma genus. Reef basslets are very popular in the hobby due to their relative hardiness, attractiveness, easy-to-feed nature, small adult size (most species), and the fact that they do not pick on sessile invertebrates. The Candy Basslet is highly prized by many aquarists, but despite the intense colouration, this is a retiring species that is often difficult to approach in the wild; therefore it does tend to command a hefty price tag when it is available. Although the Candy Basslet is fairly secretive, it makes a fascinating addition to reef aquaria where no small ornamental crustaceans are present, and often becomes bolder over time. The tank should be mature and furnished with a plethora of live rock to provide feeding opportunities and shady hiding places amongst crevices and caves. As a naturally solitary species, it is best to keep only one per tank, and not with any closely related fish, as despite its general shyness the Candy Basslet will behave aggressively towards them. The sexes cannot be told apart visually, but on occasion, mated pairs can be acquired. Tankmates to avoid include species such as dottybacks, grammas, firefish, and some of the wrasses, as many tend to occupy the same niches as the Candy Basslet and it will show much belligerence towards them.

Such groups will only work in spacious quarters, so if the aquarium is smaller, it is best to house a single specimen or a mated pair. Close relatives such as Fairy Wrasses and other small planktivores such as Firefish (which occupy the same niche) are best avoided. At night, these fish rest inside a mucus cocoon created in gaps in the rockwork. Ensure the tank has tight fitting covers, as flasher wrasses will jump from an open topped aquarium.

Carpenter's Flasher Wrasse is known from the bases of steep outer reef slopes, above coral or rubble, at depths between 27-45m (89-148ft). Here, these beautiful fish may be observed in small harems as they feed on zooplankton in the water column. Juvenile fish are orange, fading lighter ventrally, and there is a bright blue marking above each of the red eyes. As they mature, a series of broken light blue horizontal stripes start to appear across the flanks. Females remain fairly subdued in colour, with the dominant males much more colourful in comparison - the horizontal lines on the flanks becoming a bright blue/purple, and the dorsal and anal fins much larger than those of the females. The dorsal fin of dominant males also develops 2-4 long filaments, and is red in colour with bright blue (and sometimes black) highlights. During courtship rituals, the males can undergo spectacular colour changes within seconds as they dash in and out of the rockwork, displaying intense colours and flashing their elaborate fins to attract a female. This is an excellent species for the reef aquarium as it will not harm corals or pick on desirable invertebrates. The tank should be mature and as spacious as possible (this will enable you to keep multiple specimens), with a soft sand substrate. Peaceful by nature and easily bullied, Carpenter's Flasher Wrasse should only be kept alongside passive fish of similar size and peaceable temperament or they may feel too intimidated to venture out to feed. These wrasses are best maintained in small groups with several females to every male, but all individuals must be added simultaneously or else add all females before the male/s.

This particular fish was formerly identified as H. ornatissimus, but is now considered a species in its own right. H. claudia is known from much of the Pacific and parts of the Indian Ocean, from French Polynesia to Australia (including the Cocos/Keeling Islands and Christmas Island) and on towards Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. H. ornatissimus is restricted to the waters around the Hawaiian Islands and Johnston Island. The two other members of this complex are H. cosmetus and H. orientalis; H. cosmetus may be found in the Western Indian Ocean and H. orientalis is a subtropical species known from the North-West Pacific. Various different meristic and morphometric measurements do aid somewhat in identification; and although H. ornatissimus shows no real differences from H. claudia in this respect, the former does attain a significantly larger size and is much more restricted in its distribution area. This article concerns H. claudia, perhaps the most colourful member of the complex. This eyecatching red and jade fish is known from outer barrier reef slopes, up to 35m (115ft) in depth, and is usually solitary. It feeds mainly on hard-shelled prey such as crustaceans, molluscs, and urchins, so it is a species that should be added to the reef tank with quite a bit of caution. Although it should not trouble corals, it will feed on a variety of invertebrates (see Reef Aquarium Compatibility section below). However, it can play a very useful role in helping to keep nuisance flatworms and pyramidellid snails (parasites of tridacnid clams) under control. The tank should be mature and furnished with plenty of living rock to provide feeding opportunities, shady hiding places and visual barriers. There should be a deep sand bed of around 3" (7.5cm) or so, in order that the wrasse may bury itself at night or if startled. Keep either a single specimen, or, if the tank is large enough, a good sized group of 5 or 6 individuals (introduced simultaneously, when young and of the same size).

These characterful fish are known from lagoons and outer reef slopes where they are afforded lifelong protection from predators and skin parasites by a host anemone. These fish are closely associated with a number of anemones, including Cryptodendrum adhaesivum, Entacmaeaquadricolor (Bubble), Heteractisaurora (Beaded), H. crispa (Sebae),H. magnifica (Ritteri), H. malu (Malu), Macrodactyla doreensis (Long Tentacle), Stichodactyla gigantea (Giant Carpet), S haddoni (Haddon's Carpet), and S. mertensii (Merten's Carpet). In the community reef aquarium, a host anemone - some of which can be a little tricky to maintain successfully incaptivity - is not necessary for your clownfish as most reef set ups contain plenty of hiding places, no large predatory fish, and sometimes cleaner shrimp/cleaner wrasse. In the absence of an anemone, some clownfish take up residence in what they see as a suitable coral substitute - which may cause them to retract in irritation as the clownfish wallow - but this isn't always the case. Many species of clownfish (including Clark's) are now captive-raised, so wherever possible the conscientious aquarist should aim to source these hardier specimens for the home aquarium, in turn helping to take pressure off the reefs. This is a colourful species, with vivid black, white and yellow stripes, though the exact pattern shows considerable geographical variation. As these fish can be somewhat territorial, keep only one pair per tank, providing them with ample space and plenty of visual barriers amongst thedÃ©cor. It is also best not to mix this species with other species of clownfish they will fight. With regards to sexing, all clownfish are born as males. A wild colony may consist of a breeding pair, which cohabits with a few-reproductive smaller male specimens. When the female dies, the dominant male will change sex and become the female.

The adult fish are often observed in open water, adjacent to steep drop-offs, whereas juveniles are much more secretive and spend most of their time in small,invertebrate-rich caves and crevices. The diet of adult fish largely consists of sea urchins, molluscs, tunicates, crabs, and other crustaceans. Despite many drawbacks (detailed below), this dramatic-looking fish is still hugely popular with aquarists. This is a species that grows quickly and requires an enormous aquarium due to its active nature and large adult size. There must also be plenty of suitable-sized shelters amongst the rockwork. The tank should be well filtered, as these fish are voracious eaters, and there should be decent current and good levels of oxygenation. Clown Triggerfish can be highly aggressive, so it is best to keep only one per tank, and not with any close relatives. Tankmates should be equally large and belligerent - this species should never be kept with invertebrates or small, passive fish. Although younger Clown Triggerfish have been known to be fairly amiable, they are notorious for being "Jekyll and Hyde" fish, abruptly turning nasty when least expected. They are quite capable of rearranging the decor, biting through pipework/heaters, and even attacking their owners, so much caution is required when arranging the decor/equipment and when carrying out maintenance on a tank containing a large ClownTriggerfish. Avoid purchasing the really tiny specimens that are sometimes seen in the trade, as these tend not to acclimatize so well to aquarium life. Instead, opt for a medium-sized specimen, and ensure it is the last addition to the tank - well-settled Clown Triggerfish do not take well to newcomers invading their territory. As the fish matures, it is likely to become quite tame with its owner and to a degree will interact through the glass. It is tempting to hand feed such a characterful pet fish, but this is not a good idea as it will be more than capable of taking a bite out of the fingers with its sharp teeth (which it uses to crush sea urchins, crabs, and other hard-shelled foods in the wild). Bear in mind that some specimens have been known to become so incredibly aggressive and territorial, that all tankmates have ended up having to be rehomed, culminating in the Clown Triggerfish being the sole resident of the tank.

Juveniles, which are black with numerous longitudinal white streaks, are often encountered in outer reef flats. These fish feed mainly on small, hard-shelled prey including crustaceans and molluscs, so it is a species that should be added to the reef tank with some caution. Although it should not trouble corals, it will feed on a variety of invertebrates (see Reef Aquarium Compatibility section below). However, it can play a very useful role in helping to keep nuisance flatworms and pyramidellid snails (parasites of tridacnid clams) under control. The tank should be mature and furnished with plenty of living rock to provide feeding opportunities, shady hiding places and visual barriers. There should be a deep sand bed of around 3" (7.5cm) or so, in order that the wrasse may bury itself at night or if startled. Keep either a single specimen, or, if the tank is large enough, a good sized group of 5 or 6 individuals (introduced simultaneously, when young and of the same size). Young Dusky Wrasses rarely cause problems in a community type set-up, but larger adults have been known to pick on small passive fish, such as flasher wrasses, fairy wrasses, and firefish, so these combinations are best avoided. Powerful filtration and circulation with a high level of oxygenation are a must, as are tight fitting coverslides; these fish are expert jumpers. The colour of the Dusky Wrasse varies greatly, depending on sex, age, and mood. Juveniles and females are much more muted, compared to that of a mature male in full breeding dress - showing an array of dazzling peacock-like dusky green and blue colours interspersed with bold red markings, and a bright green crescent on the caudal fin. Although this fish is currently considered a single species with a number of geographical colour variants, the taxonomic status is in some disarray with the possibility that it will be split into 2 or 3 separate species in the future; some experts stating that the name H. marginatus should be reserved for the Red Sea population only, with the Indian Ocean variants identified as H. lamarii (currently considered synonymous with H. marginatus), and further suggesting H. annularis for the Pacific Ocean fish. This is not a commonly seen species in the trade, only making sporadic appearances. May also be seen on sale as the Splendid Rainbow Wrasse.',feeding:"Carnivorous.

The first generation of this hybrid fish - known simply as the Indigo Dottyback -  was rather more magenta and less stripy, but subsequent breedings have refined the characteristics to that of the Electric Indigo Dottyback that is pictured here, with more of a blue-turquoise hue and distinct horizontal stripes. This charming little fish is fairly peaceful as far as Dottybacks are concerned, and it makes a wonderful addition to reef aquaria where no small ornamental crustaceans are present. Be aware that adults will eat small shrimp, but they will also prey on many invertebrate pests; small fireworms are consumed with relish. The aquarium must be mature and should include ample rockwork, arranged so that there is an abundance of small caves, crevices, channels, and overhangs that provide safe, shady retreats for this fish. Electric Indigo Dottybacks generally mix well with other community type reef inhabitants, but occasional specimens can be a little territorial (although this is more likely to occur in smaller aquaria where space/hiding places are at a premium). Nevertheless, they should be one of the last fish introduced to the tank. Do not house with any large, aggressive species, as the dottyback will be very easily intimidated and may refuse to come out and feed, leading to starvation. If the aquarium is very spacious, and has plenty of visual barriers amongst the decor, more than one specimen may be kept together if of the same size and introduced simultaneously. However, if the system is on the smaller side, it really is best to keep just the one specimen and not with any easily bullied tankmates. It is essential that the tank has tight fitting coverslides, as Electric Indigo Dottybacks are expert jumpers. As with other dottybacks, these fish can readily change colour, depending on mood, time of day, or comfort level.

In thewild, juveniles have been observed in the semi-protected areas of outer reefflats, often hidden under ledges or in holes amongst the rockwork. Sub-adultsventure slightly further afield to surge channels, whereas larger, matureadults inhabit areas of rich coral growth in clear lagoons, channels, and seawardreefs. The maximum depth they have been observed at is 100m (328ft). The EmperorAngelfish is a large-growing, active species which requires a voluminousaquarium. This fish is territorial so provide plenty of live rockwork that hasa multitude of visual barriers and bolt holes, as well as a roomy swimmingspace along the front of the tank. Keep only one specimen per tank, and notwith any other angelfish. Tankmates should be equally large and belligerent -this species should never be kept with invertebrates or small, passive fish. Theaquarium should be well filtered, as these fish are voracious eaters, and thereshould be areas of decent current and good levels of oxygenation. EmperorAngelfish feed on many sessile invertebrates in the wild, including sponges,stony corals, and tunicates, so it is not a safe species for every set up;however, it can usually be kept successfully alongside some of the more noxioussoft corals. We recommend that the Emperor Angelfish is the last addition to anaquarium, as otherwise it can behave somewhat pugnaciously when introducing newtankmates into what it perceives as its established domain. Interestingly, inthe wild, both adults and juvenile Emperor Angelfish have been observedcleaning much larger species, such as the curious-looking Ocean Sunfish. Juvenilefish look very different to the adults: young fish are dark-blue/black with concentriccircular white and cyan stripes originating just in front of the caudalpeduncle. Adult fish have a yellow body with blue horizontal stripes and abright yellowy-orange caudal fin. A striking black mask covers the eyes and alarge vertical band extends roughly three-quarters of the way up the body fromthe vicinity of the pectoral fins. Both the mask and the vertical band are highlightedwith bright blue, and the mouth area is white.

Whilst many of the Fang or Sabre-ToothedBlennies are known to parasitize other fish, those from the Meiacanthus genus (of which 28 species have been formerly described) feed only on zooplankton as they hover in the water column, and on tiny benthic invertebrates they find on the reef. JuvenileForktail Fang Blennies tend to gather in small groups, whereas the adults are solitary or seen in pairs. These pretty blue and yellow blennies are distinguished from others of the same genus by the blue-edged diagonal black line extending from the eye, yellow dorsal fin, and deeply forked caudal fin. Meiacanthus species tend to be quite inoffensive, but they do possess two venomous canine-like teeth in the lower jaw that can be employed should they be attacked. Most fish know to leave them alone, but if they are ingested, a quick, sharp bite on the inside of the predator's mouth from the blenny ensures that it is spat out again " and it is usually none the worse for wear. These fish do not employ their weaponry in an active manner, instead, they use it only as a last resort to defend themselves or their territory. Other fish such as the Bicolour Blenny (Ecsenius bicolor)and the Bicolour Fang Blenny Mimic (Plagiotremuslaudanus) have evolved to mimic this species in order to afford themselves protection from predators, even though they do not possess the same effective dentition-deterrent as the Meiacanthus species. Whilst Forktail Fang Blennies can sometimes be a little secretive, they are generally far more self-assured than other blenniids (most likely due to the possession of such potent defensive apparatus) and will often be seen hovering about in the water column above the rockwork in an inquisitive manner. Provide the Forktail Fang Blenny with a mature tank that contains an abundance of liverock, so that it may continually graze upon it for small crustaceans; without such quantity of well-established rockwork, these fish will not fare very well. It is best to keep just one specimen per tank unless you can acquire a known mated pair, as these fish can be a little territorial in the confines of theaverage aquarium. Will cohabit with most species, except for close relatives and much larger carnivorous fish. Ensure that the tank has tight-fitting coverslides as these fish are expert jumpers. Interestingly, this species is replaced by the all-yellow M. oualanensis inFiji, and by M. tongaensis in Tonga. Please be aware that whilst the bites of Fang Blennies are not usually dangerous to most people, they can be very painful. Therefore some degree ofcaution is required when carrying out maintenance in the aquarium, taking particular care not to intrude too closely upon their territory.

These majestic fish are often seen in pairs as they cruise about the reef, feeding on algae, bryozoans, gorgonians, sponges, tunicates, and zoantharians. Juvenile fish, which look rather different to the adults, tend cleaning stations where they service a broad range of clients, including grunts, jacks, morays, snappers, tangs, and wrasses. This angelfish is a large-growing, active species and requires a voluminous aquarium. Due to its territorial nature, it will need to be provided with plenty of live rockwork that has a multitude of visual barriers and bolt holes, as well as a roomy swimming space along the front of the tank. Keep only one specimen per tank, and not with any other angelfish. Tankmates should be equally large and belligerent - this species should never be kept with invertebrates or small, passive fish. The aquarium should be well filtered, as these fish are voracious eaters, and do provide areas of brisk current with a good level of oxygenation. As mentioned above, in the wild, French Angelfish feed on many sessile invertebrates, including stony corals and soft corals, so unfortunately it is not suitable for reef aquaria. We recommend that the French Angelfish is the last addition to an aquarium, as otherwise it can behave somewhat pugnaciously when introducing new tankmates into what it perceives as its established domain. It is best to source a medium sized specimen (i.e. over 5" in length) as they are more likely to acclimatise well to life in captivity. Tiny or extra large specimens may have a difficult time settling in, so aim for a healthy-looking fish that is neither too small nor excessively large. Juvenile fish look rather different to the adults: young fish display a pattern of six vertical yellow stripes (including two on the tail), some mildly curved. Once the fish reaches 12.5cm (5") or so, the pattern will begin to change into the adult form with the stripes disappearing completely and the fish displaying yellow flecks across the dark grey flanks. The pictured fish is a young adult which is still displaying the stripes, and the yellow flecking has started to appear on the flanks. Confusingly, juvenile French Angelfish look almost identical to juvenile Grey/Gray Angelfish (P. arcuatus); however, the caudal fin of P. arcuatus is more squared off and has a transparent margin in comparison to that of P. paru.`,feeding:"Should be offered a varied diet including ample Spirulina & marine algae as well as meaty fare.

Their range extends from Mauritius to the Society Islands, north to Japan, and south to Australia. During the day, this spectacular dwarf species hides away in caves or amongst sponges - sometimes resting in an upside-down position - and at night will venture out to feed on small fishes and crustaceans. The Fu Manchu is regarded as the most difficult lionfish species to keep in captivity, and as such, is not suitable for beginners. In the home aquarium, this is a rather secretive fish and will it behave reclusively during daylight hours, so must be provided with ample shady retreats amongst the decor such as dark caves and rocky overhangs. Well filtered water with a moderate current is essential. Keep only one per tank, unless the aquarium is of vast proportions and there is an abundance of visual barriers. Even then, very careful observation is paramount, as no two fish behave in exactly the same manner, and it is not unheard of for one specimen to attack and kill another of the same type, particularly if the fish are of different sizes. Do not house with other species of lionfish. Tankmates should be chosen with care, as small fish and shrimp will be eaten, yet the Fu Manchu Lionfish is easily harassed by larger, more belligerent species which may prevent it from getting its fair share of food.

Breeding

This species has spawned in the home aquarium, but raising the microscopic larvae is extremely challenging. The male will create a suitable cave, usually under the rockwork and will entice the female to spawn. Once the egg mass has been laid/fertilised, the male drives off the female and guards the cave until the eggs hatch, which is usually at around 72-96 hours (temperature dependent).

You will need to ensure that the eggs are very gently aerated in the absence of the parent fish. The time it takes for the eggs to hatch will vary depending on water temperature and other factors, but on average this is usually around 8 days.

However, it absolutely must only ever be added to a biologically established set-up, so careful planning is required. Golden Angelfish are recommended for experienced aquarists only.

Feeding

Should be offered a varied diet including Spirulina & marine algae as well as meaty fare such as vitamin/Spirulina-enriched brineshrimp, Mysis shrimp, special sponge-based Angelfish preparations, and finely chopped krill/squid/cockle/mussel. Feed small amounts 3 times per day, target feeding if necessary.



This species has not been bred in captivity. As with other dwarf angels, Golden Angelfish are protogynous hermaphrodites, a form of sequential hermaphroditism where an individual can change from female to male.`,overview:{Synonyms:"None",Distribution:"Western and Southern Pacific",MaxiumumSize:'10cm (3.9")',Temperature:"Tropical: 23-27°C",WaterParameters:"SG: 1.020-1.025, pH: 8.1-8.4",Compatibility:"Reef with caution",Lighting:"If bright lighting is used, provide an abundance of shady crevices and overhangs, and ensure the illumination switches on and off in a gradual manner.","Reef Aquarium Compatibility":"Caution required: may nip at stony corals, Xenia, zoanthids & clam mantles.","Sexual Dimorphism":"Unknown"},image_url:"https://www.fishkeeper.co.uk/media//cache/2068x/databank/images/image//Auranti_2__1.jpg"},{name:"Green Chromis",care:"",feeding:"",breeding:"",overview:{Synonyms:"Pomacentrus viridis",Distribution:"Indo-Pacific",MaxiumumSize:'9cm (3.5")',Temperature:"Tropical: 23-27°C",WaterParameters:"SG: 1.020-1.025, pH: 8.1-8.4",Compatibility:"Reef",Lighting:"No special requirements","Reef Aquarium Compatibility":"Excellent","Sexual Dimorphism":"Young individuals mature as females, changing sex if they become dominant.

These herbivorous fish are moderately gregarious and are often observed feeding in small harems. Herald's Angelfish requires a mature aquarium with plenty of live rockwork, on which it can graze for the microalgae, and in which it can hide. This vibrant, golden fish is rather notorious for picking on zoanthids and LPS corals (see Reef Aquarium Compatibility below) so caution is advised when adding to a reef set up; the larger the tank, the better, as the fish is then less likely to continually pick at any particular sessile invertebrate and cause irreparable damage. A frequent, varied feeding regime will also help in this respect. Like most other members of the Centropyge genus, Herald's Angelfish does not grow very large, but nevertheless, it is an active species which requires plenty of space. Unless the aquarium is of XL proportions, only one specimen should be housed per tank, and not with any other Centropyge species. If the aquarium is spacious enough, it is possible to keep a male-female pair, or a small harem of one male and two or three females, if they are all of a fairly young age and are added simultaneously. However, this should only ever be attempted by advanced aquarists who have the means to separate the fish if a problem arises. Good filtration, along with decent water movement to generate high levels of oxygenation, are a must. This is a territorial species that will behave pugnaciously when newcomers are added to the tank after it has become established (particularly small placid fish) and so we advise that when planning on including a Herald's Angelfish in your stock list, it should be the last fish that is added to the aquarium. This species is considered one of the least hardy of the dwarf angelfish, and so is not recommended for beginners. There are many natural colour variants of this species, the most commonly seen being the variant from the Coral Sea area of the Great Barrier Reef which has a black horizontal blotch edged thinly in blue on the posterior portion of the dorsal fin, and sometimes a small black saddle on the back. This variant was once thought to be a different species and was erroneously referred to as "Centropyge whiteheadi" but is now known to be a geographical colour variant of C. heraldi. Another variant has a black blotch on the posterior of the dorsal and also a black anal fin. Interestingly, these black patches are said to sometimes disappear in the aquarium, rendering the fish a solid golden yellow, akin to the standard form. Dusky coloured variants are also known from Cebu and Vanuatu, and these may have a dusting of black all over, or just confined to one area, such as the head. Again, the black duskiness tends to vanish in the home aquarium. May also be seen on sale as False Lemonpeel Angelfish or Yellow Angelfish.`,feeding:"This species requires more algae and seaweed in its diet compared to other dwarf angelfish.

These fish are usually observed in pairs, hovering just a few centimetres above the sandy/rubbly substrate at the entrance to their burrow, which they share with an alpheid (pistol) shrimp. Hi-fin Banded Gobies are very passive and make a great addition to peaceful reef aquaria. They are best kept in a compatible male-female pair (your supplier may be able to source you a mated pair) but be sure not to simply place two individuals together from different sources, as if it turns out that they are both males, they will fight - especially in smaller aquaria. The tank should be furnished with plenty of live rock and a reasonable depth of sandy substrate (~10cm/4"), with a good selection of small rubble pieces that vary in size (not too big to be moved), from which a burrow can be created. Tankmates should be small and peaceful, as pugnacious species will intimidate these diminutive bottom dwellers and prevent them from feeding. As with other members of the same genus, this goby forms a symbiotic partnership with an almost blind alpheid shrimp; together they share the safety of a burrow which the shrimp digs/maintains, and the goby keeps watch for predators. Whilst the shrimp is working, it maintains antennal contact with its goby partner posted at the entrance of the shared burrow. If the shrimp detects the quivering motion of the goby"™s caudal fin during an unusual situation, it reacts by immediately withdrawing into the depths of the burrow, hastily followed by the goby. The entrance to the shared burrow will be closed at night, and only one entrance is usually open at any one time. The shrimp will only emerge from the burrow whilst it can have tactile contact with the goby. A shrimp partner is not strictly necessary, but if they can be acquired together, they will make such a fascinating display, captivating the observer for hours on end.

Will consume a wide range of meaty fare including Mysis shrimp, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, finely chopped krill/prawns etc. If reluctant to feed at first, use a turkey baster to direct some food lower down in the tank to where the goby may be hiding in its burrow. Feed small amounts 3 times per day.

Breeding

Hi-fin Banded Gobies have spawned in the home aquarium, but there are no reports of successfully rearing the larvae past settlement. Just prior to spawning, the belly of the female fish will become noticeably swollen when full of eggs. Spawning occurs inside the cave or under a rock, where an egg mass will be deposited/fertilised.

Keeping these fish in small aggregations will encourage natural behaviour, with the males putting on some fantastic displays with fin-flaring, as they attempt to attract a mate. Such groups will only work in spacious quarters, so if the aquarium is smaller, it is best to house a single specimen or a mated pair. Close relatives such as Fairy Wrasses and other small planktivores such as Firefish (which occupy the same niche) are best avoided. At night, these fish rest inside a mucus cocoon created in gaps in the rockwork. Ensure the tank has tight fitting covers, as flasher wrasses will jump from an open topped aquarium. To date, this is the largest known member of the Paracheilinus genus. May also be seen on sale as the Filamented Flasher Wrasse.

Feeding

Feed a variety of meaty foods in small amounts several times per day, including Mysis shrimp, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, finely chopped krill, and plankton. Over time, may also learn to accept flake foods. Feed small amounts, several times per day.

Here these fish have been observed forming small aggregations of up to 5 individuals at steep outer reef drop offs and areas of black coral and sea fan growths. This small-sized butterflyfish is one of a complex of several similar looking fish and is only sporadically seen in the aquarium trade. This species is regarded as moderately difficult, and is therefore recommended for advanced aquarists only. A good-sized, mature system is requisite, along with ample live rock for the fish to browse upon/hide amongst and a large open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Water temperature should be lower than average on account of these fish hailing from deeper, slightly cooler waters (typically 22-80m/72-263ft). Medium sized specimens tend to acclimatise better to aquarium life, adapting much more quickly to various prepared foods, so try and choose a healthy, alert specimen around 7cm (2.8") in length. Smaller sized fish may be reluctant to feed, and larger specimens can sometimes be rather finicky, requiring faultless water conditions. An aquarium that has some areas of lush filamentous algae growth will also aid your new fish in settling into its new surroundings; however, as with other butterflyfish species, these fish demand excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of brisk current. Some aquarists have successfully kept the Indian Butterflyfish alongside some of the more noxious soft corals, but this is something of a risk, and they should be observed carefully. Stony corals and many other sessile invertebrates will be constantly nipped at, so unfortunately must be avoided. Keep only one Indian Butterflyfish per tank (unless a mated pair is acquired) and not with any other butterflyfish as they will squabble over territories. Whilst they can be a little shy when first introduced, providing them with ample retreats amongst the live rock will ensure they quickly gain confidence and venture out into the open. Once settled, these intelligent, peaceful fish actually become very assertive feeders, competing with most other fish species, and they will also be most curious of any activity in and around their aquarium. Tankmates should be of similar size and temperament. As mentioned above, C. mitratus forms part of a complex of similar-looking, deepwater fish known as the Tinker's Complex, which also includes C. burgessi, C. declivis, C. flavocoronatus, and C. tinkeri.

At night, these fish have been observed digging holes below coral bases for shelter. The Indian Trigger has a subtle beauty and is one of the few triggerfish species that can be safely kept in most reef aquaria.

This is a species that should be added to the reef tank with a bit of caution; although it should not trouble corals, it will feed on a variety of invertebrates (see Reef Aquarium Compatibility section below). However, it can play a very useful role in helping to keep nuisance flatworms and pyramidellid snails (parasites of tridacnid clams) under control. The tank should be mature and furnished with plenty of living rock to provide feeding opportunities, shady hiding places and visual barriers. There should be a deep sand bed of around 3" (7.5cm) or so, in order that the wrasse may bury itself at night or if startled. Keep either a single specimen, or, if the tank is large enough, a good sized group of 5 or 6 individuals (ideally introduced simultaneously). Young Jade Wrasses rarely cause problems in a community type set-up, but large adults have been known to pick on small passive fish, such as flasher wrasses, fairy wrasses, and firefish, so these combinations are best avoided.

Feeding

By far and away, this species does best if a decent growth of filamentous algae is present in the aquarium for the fish to harvest at its leisure. Also offer plenty of vegetable matter, including frozen foods that contain marine algae and Spirulina. Nori (dried seaweed), algae flake and algae wafers formulated for marine fish are usually met with much enthusiasm. If you have space in a well lit sump, filamentous algae can be cultured on pieces of rock, and occasionally rotated with some of the pieces in the main display aquarium.

Breeding

This species has spawned in the home aquarium, but the young have not yet been raised past the larval stage. During courtship, the male turns white in colour but retains dark colouration on the head. The bright yellow eggs are demersal and adhesive, and are attached to the substrate via a filamentous, adhesive pad. They typically hatch in 8 days.`,feeding:`Care

This small triggerfish is known only from Kiritimati (Christmas Island) in the Line Islands chain in the Central Pacific. These islands are an expansive collection of breathtakingly beautiful low-lying atolls with partially or fully enclosed lagoons and coral islands with surrounding reefs. At Kiritimati, this triggerfish has been most frequently observed inhabiting a fairly deep zone between 90-100m (296-328ft), below a significant thermocline at around 85m (279ft). The water in the area above the thermocline measured 25-28 °C (typical reef temperatures), and was 20-22 °C below. No X. greenei were observed above the thermocline, but it proved to be a common species in the region below. The habitat itself consists of a gently sloping hard substratum with patches of rocks, coral rubble, and small boltholes. Below 100m, this gives way to a vertical drop-off and another thermocline (the temperature measuring 10-14 °C below this) and no X. greenei were observed in this area. The Kiri Triggerfish is one of the few triggerfish species that can be safely kept in most reef aquaria. Sessile invertebrates are typically ignored, but it must be mentioned that larger Kiri Triggerfish are likely to eat any ornamental shrimp they come across.

X. greenei, like the similar-looking X. lineopunctatus from the Western Indian Ocean, and X. ringens from the Western Atlantic, all have 3 (vs. 5 in X. auromarginatus, X. caeruleolineatus, and X. mento). The colour of X. greenei, X. lineopunctatus, and X. ringens is almost identical; however, X. greenei has a lower body scale count, body spots are reduced to a few speckles dorsally, and it attains a much smaller standard length (15.4cm vs 25/26cm).',feeding:"Meaty frozen foods such as vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, Spirulina-enriched brineshrimp, Mysis shrimp, chopped krill/squid/cockle/mussel.

Adults are usually found in pairs, feeding near the substrate on various small crustaceans, but some specimens have been found in open water, attached to drifting Sargassum some 20km (12.4miles) from the shore. Most specimens seen in the aquatics trade will have been captive bred, the majority by the Tropical Marine Centre (TMC). This helps to take pressure off of the wild populations, currently listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species and CITES II listed. Interestingly, the common Seahorse has two main colour phases: black and yellow. The black form can be grey to black with a somewhat grainy-looking appearance, and the yellow form may be cream, yellow, or golden, with fairly large dark spots (especially in the females) and a black line running from their chest to their abdomen. The golden phase seahorses are capable of dramatic colour change, depending on their surroundings, mood, or stress, and they may take on an olive appearance when first adjusting to their new home. Other variable colour forms are far less common, but some individuals may show a mixture of black and yellow. Instead of scales, all seahorses have a layer of skin that is stretched over bony plates, visible as a series of rings around the trunk. The eyes can move independently of one another, and locomotion is powered by rapidly oscillating the dorsal fin, whilststeering with the pectorals. In this species, the coronet is typically of a low to medium height and rounded, sometimes with a cup-like depression in the top, and with a noticeable overhang at the back. The skin is not particularly spiny in this species, instead, there are low, rounded bumps, and 11 conspicuous trunk rings (plus 34-38 tail rings). In order for seahorses to thrive in captivity, they are best maintained in mature species-only aquaria, where they will not be subjected to boisterous companions and outcompeted for food. Ideally, the aquarium will provide plenty of stationary branching decor which they can grab onto with their amazing prehensile tails e.g. gorgonian skeletons, plastic plants, orlive marine greenery. As they are masters of camouflage, providing areas of golden-hueddÃ©cor is known to encourage gold phase specimens to take on their most intense colours. Water flow should be gentle so that these poor swimmers are not blown into solid surfaces; gentle current also having the added benefit of increasing their chances of finding plenty of food items. As steady feedings are required,regular partial water changes are essential (be very careful in matching the temperature and salinity of the new water to that which you have taken from the tank). The use of a small protein skimmer can be very beneficial. In addition to the requisite branching decor as mentioned above, a live sand bed plus some live rock will help to culture various prey items such as amphipods and isopods, which the seahorses can browse upon in between the times when the aquarist adds food to the tank. Many find that an adjacent refugium is extremely beneficial in keeping a constant supply of live food available to their seahorses. Before purchase, ensure that the seahorses are in good health and are feeding well (ask the shop to demonstrate). When seahorses are to be taken from an aquarium i.e. when purchasing or if moving them to different quarters, always ensure that they are herded into a suitable container or bag under the water; if they are lifted free from the water, they may well ingest air which can cause them problems. Likewise, many species can all too easily become entangled in nets and then subsequently damaged when trying to free them. The herding under technique really is the kindest method of capture. Please plan your seahorse aquarium carefully and responsibly - the primary lack of success in keeping syngnathids in captivity is starvation, which is so easily avoided. To reiterate: (1) provide a mature, stable, and gentle, "non-competitive" environment with appropriate decor, (2) ensure that there is an ongoing supply of various nutritious foods via very regular feedings, living sand/rock, and a fishless refugium, and (3) choose healthy captive-bred livestock that is provento be feeding well, and is bagged for you without exposure to air. Seahorsesare not suitable for beginners.',feeding:'Seahorses must be givenfrequent feeding sessions every day, with prey items available to them for atleast 20-30 minutes at a time. Initially, only live foods may be taken, butthey can often be weaned onto other foodstuffs over time. Offer a variety ofmeaty foods such as Mysis shrimp, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp***, various isopodsand amphipods (such as marine Gammarusshrimp), and small gut-loaded river/glass shrimp (gut-load with HUFA-rich foodsprior to feeding). Starter cultures of various marine "pods are available from anumber of sources, but be prepared to have somewhere to keep and feed them(such as a refugium).',breeding:`The Common Seahorse is
regularly captive-bred for the trade, taking pressure off the vulnerable wild
populations; it has also been bred in the home aquarium. This species is
monogamous, and prior to breeding, the couple will begin an elaborate courtship
ritual where the male dances around the female, whilst changing colour and
producing clicking sounds. After a time, the pair will entwine their tails and
float together over the substrate. They will then turn belly to belly and the
female will insert her ovipositor into the males brood pouch (which is located
on his belly, under the tail) and lays her eggs. The male then fertilises the
eggs, which subsequently become embedded into the walls of the pouch. The brood
size is quite variable, depending on the age and size of the parents, but will
typically number around 200-300 on average. The courtship ritual will then
continue for some time, even after the male has become pregnant. Some 20-28
days later, the male goes into labour (usually at night), and this can be quite
a strenuous task that involves much thrusting, sometimes over the course of
several hours, until all of the young seahorses are released. There is no
parental care, the pelagic young are fully independent and fend for themselves,
usually attaching themselves to decor or greenery near the surface. They measure
around 7mm/0.28" when born, and can be fed baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) straight away. It may
be of interest to know that 5 generations of this species have been
successfully kept and raised at one public aquarium.`,overview:{Synonyms:"Hippocampus aterrimus, H. chinensis, H. hilonis, H.horai, H. kuda multiannularis, H. melanospilos, H. moluccensis, H. novaehebudorum, H. polytaenia, H. raji, H. rhynchomacer, H. taeniops, H. taeniopterus, H. tristis",Distribution:"Indo-Pacific",MaxiumumSize:'30cm (11.8")',Temperature:"Tropical: 22-28°C",WaterParameters:"SG: 1.020-1.025, pH: 8.1-8.4",Compatibility:'Species-only aquarium recommended "“ very difficult to feed properly in a typical reef set-up.',Lighting:"Dim to moderate","Reef Aquarium Compatibility":"Will not harm invertebrates.

This secretive species congregates in sizeable shoals to feed on zooplankton, crustacean larvae, and fish eggs, with one male fish overseeing a large harem of females. This is a delicate species that is really only suitable for advanced aquarists with mature, dimly-lit, deepwater tanks. In the confines of the home aquarium, it is best to keep either a solitary specimen, or else a group comprising of a single male and at least 8 females. Unfortunately, smaller groups will result in squabbles, where the weakest fish is likely to be picked on and prevented from feeding, eventually succumbing to being bullied by the others. These large shoals should only be considered if the tank is of XXL proportions " if the tank is of average size, it really is best to house a single specimen only. Longfin Anthias are relatively peaceable and somewhat shy. They should not be housed with direct food competitors or with docile species such as firefish. Conversely, ensure that their tankmates are not overly large, belligerent species either, or the Longfin Anthias will feel intimidated. Longfin Anthias are usually perfectly safe in a mature deep reef set up, typically swimming out and about in the open water areas and ignoring sessile invertebrates. It is essential that illumination is kept subdued if these fish are going to acclimatise successfully though; the bright lighting of a typical shallow-water reef is cited as one of the key reasons for these fish not adjusting well to life in the home aquarium. Provide plenty of shady crevices and overhangs amongst the rockwork, ensuring all structures are stable. Likewise, the temperature of the tank water is also crucial: as these fish inhabit deepwater drop-offs where they are often exposed to an upwelling of colder currents, the aquarium water temperature should not be allowed to rise above 25 °C (77 deg F), so a means of chilling the water may be necessary during hot summer months. A varied diet is a must to keep the fish in good health and for them to display their vibrant colouration. Ideally they will be fed small amounts several times per day (see below). An attached refugium cultivating copepods and amphipods can also really help to provide a steady, ongoing supply of nutritious live food to keep this active planktivore content. Powerful filtration and protein skimming, plus a good maintenance regime are essential for maintaining optimal water quality despite the heavy nutrient input. As these fish inhabit areas of moderate to strong currents in the wild, they require fairly brisk water movement in the home aquarium - a high level of oxygenation at all times being of utmost importance. There are a considerable number of geographical variants of this species, and all are very eyecatching. The fish in the above picture are from the Coral Sea.

Ideally, there will be plenty of rockwork and a sand substrate that is 3-4" deep, to provide resting places for your wrasse. Provide clean, well oxygenated water with areas of fast current. Two male morphs exist: an "initial phase male" (also known as the secondary male) and a "terminal phase male". Initial phase males are non-territorial and do not look like typical males, but often spawn in groups with other females. Terminal phase males are very territorial, and their colouration is distinctively brighter. Individuals can be born as males or females, but if they are born males, they are not born as terminal phase males. Should the terminal phase male be lost from the group, a female or one of the initial phase males will become the terminal phase male. In this instance, it is usually the most dominant female or the most dominant initial phase male that replaces the previous terminal phase male. Relatively speaking, this is one of the more peaceful wrasse species, and is usually safe alongside similarly sized fish; but be aware that initial/secondary phase males can become much more territorial, so observe carefully.

Feeding

A newly imported Marine Betta may require live river shrimp, with gradual weaning onto frozen fare such as Mysis shrimp, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, krill, chopped seafood etc. Unlikely to take dried foods. Offer at least one feed after lights out, target feeding if necessary. Observe carefully to make sure faster tankmates are not outcompeting this fish at meal times.

Breeding

This species has been bred in the home aquarium. Little is known of the courtship behaviour, as this invariably takes place inside darkened caves and crevices. Up to 500 golden-brown eggs are deposited on the wall or roof of the chosen cave. The male fish guards the eggs, which should hatch within 5-6 days (temperature dependent). The resultant larvae are well-developed and begin feeding immediately. Initially dark in colour, they develop a large white patch on each flank, and it is some 6-7 months later before they display the adult pattern.`,feeding:`Care

Breeding

This species has been bred in the home aquarium. Little is known of the courtship behaviour, as this invariably takes place inside darkened caves and crevices. Up to 500 golden-brown eggs are deposited on the wall or roof of the chosen cave. The male fish guards the eggs, which should hatch within 5-6 days (temperature dependent). The resultant larvae are well-developed and begin feeding immediately. Initially dark in colour, they develop a large white patch on each flank, and it is some 6-7 months later before they display the adult pattern.`,breeding:`Care

The Marine Betta is known from coral reefs and drop-offs, to depths of 50m (164ft). Here, this reclusive, nocturnal species may be found hiding in dark caves and crevices by day, emerging at night to feed. In the home aquarium, this hardy, eye-catching fish is safe with corals, but does not appreciate the bright lighting that many sessile invertebrates require. If it is to be kept in a reef setting, ensure that there are a multitude of dark caves and crevices amongst the rockwork so that it can take refuge during the day, and preferably some areas of the tank that have more subdued lighting. Tankmates must be chosen with care, as adult Marine Bettas are capable of taking small fish and ornamental shrimps; however, they are a great choice for reef set-ups that contain corals and medium sized peaceful fish only. This fish behaves very shyly, especially when first introduced into the aquarium, but it can be coaxed out a little more if it is given adequate space, areas of subdued lighting/plenty of dark hidey-holes, and peaceful tankmates that are not too boisterous at feeding times. Unless the tank is very spacious, it is best to keep just a single specimen, unless you can acquire a compatible pair. A dim moon light that is run during the evening hours will allow you to view your Marine Betta as it goes about its business under the preferred subdued illumination. Interestingly, this species is a Batesian mimic of the Guineafowl Moray Eel (Gymnothorax meleagris). When threatened, the Marine Betta holds all its unpaired fins erect and swims headfirst into a crevice. Rather than swimming right into the hole, it stops part way in, with the posterior part of its body exposed. The back end of the Marine Betta, with fins held erect, resembles the shape of a moray eel's head. The white spotted pattern and the prominent ocellus on the dorsal fin further add to the illusion that it is a spotted moray eel peering out from a rock, and by appearing to be something dangerous, the 'moray eel' is then given a wide berth by would-be predators.

Here they form large aggregations as they feed on zooplankton in the water column. This is a very active, semi-aggressive acanthurid that requires a great deal of swimming space - adults have been known to grow to over a foot and a half long and are powerful fish. If you are blessed with a system of enormous proportions, the Mata Tang could make a wonderful centrepiece. The tank should contain plenty of live rock which this fish will enjoy grazing upon. Include plenty of hiding places that are large enough for the Mata Tang to retreat into quickly should it feel threatened, at the same time aiming for an aquascape that allows plenty of open swimming space along the front of the aquarium for such a powerful swimmer. Mata Tangs are moderately aggressive towards tankmates, and in the confines of the home aquarium, this includes their own kind; for this reason it is best to house just one specimen per tank. There are good reports of this fish mixing with tangs of other genera; however it is recommended that the Mata Tang is the last addition to a set up, as it can be rather territorial to newcomers, especially similar fish species. It is best to source a medium sized specimen (i.e. over 4" in length) as they are more likely to acclimatise well to life in captivity. Conversely, extra large specimens may have a difficult time settling in, so aim for a healthy-looking fish that is neither too small nor excessively large. Avoid any specimens that appear "pinched" in the belly area, and do ask your retailer to show you that your chosen fish is feeding well prior to purchase. Mata Tangs have a high metabolism and require small frequent feeds throughout the day. Powerful filtration/vigorous circulation and a high level of oxygenation are therefore essential for this energetic, voracious eater. Be sure to keep on top of water quality as this fish will not tolerate deteriorating water conditions. A large refugium with living rock can be most useful: macroalgae can be cultured on this rock and these pieces rotated with pieces from the main tank, so that the Mata Tang has a continual supply of natural foodstuffs to graze upon. Take care when handling, as the caudal spines can inflict very painful wounds. A period of quarantine can be a valuable procedure for the acclimatisation of all livestock, and it is of particular importance for the Mata Tang which can be fairly susceptible to developing marine whitespot. This can be difficult to treat in the reef aquarium. Ideally the fish should be quarantined and carefully observed in a separate aquarium for at least a fortnight before being introduced into your main display tank.

This unusual triggerfish - with its extraordinarily lengthy and somewhat menacing-looking snout - is fairly uncommon and is rarely seen in the trade. It is part of the group of seven so-called 'Picasso triggerfish' of the Rhinecanthus genus, all with remarkably similar traits (with the exception of the favoured habitat of R. abyssus, which is known from much deeper waters compared to that of the other 6 species). This group of fish are primarily brown, grey, or white, and display strongly contrasting patterns in black, blue, orange, or yellow. All adult fish sport a dark line (in most species interspersed with blue) that extends from  the forehead down through the eye to the pectoral fin. As R. cinereus is seldomly seen in the hobby, it is likely to command a somewhat hefty price tag when it is imported. The Mauritius Triggerfish is an outgoing species that, over time, will learn to recognise its owner. Like many other members of this family, it is an aggressive fish that is best maintained in a large fish-only aquarium with tankmates of a similar size and disposition. As the fish matures, so its aggression level will heighten. In addition to a decent amount of swimming space, ample shelter should be provided for it to establish a territory of its own. Mauritius Triggerfish will attack all manner of invertebrate life, which renders it an unsuitable species for the reef aquarium. Care must be taken with the aquascaping as they do like to move aquarium decor around. They are also notorious for biting through tubing, and even heaters, so it is worth thinking carefully about where you place your equipment. Keep only one specimen per tank, and not with any other Triggerfish species, due to territorial nature. Smaller fish are likely to end up on the menu. Although triggerfish often become "hand tame" and beg for food whilst making grunting noises, it is not advisable to feed directly from your hands as the fingers could easily be mistaken for a meaty snack. Always keep a close eye on where the fish is when carrying out any maintenance in the tank. At night, this species may be observed sleeping in strange positions.

Juvenile fish tend to inhabit shallow protected reef environments, whereas the adults (who are usually found singly or in pairs) favour deep coastal reef slopes and outer reef walls where they can be observed feeding on various types of algae growing on the rocks. This species is rarely encountered in the trade, but if the aquarist is blessed with an enormous system, this fish is well worth looking out for as it would make a wonderful centrepiece. The tank should be mature and contain plenty of live rock which the Orange Face Tang will enjoy grazing upon. Include plenty of hiding places that are large enough for your fish to retreat into quickly should it feel threatened, at the same time aiming for an aquascape that allows plenty of open swimming space along the front of the aquarium for such a powerful swimmer. Orange Face Tangs are not overly aggressive towards tankmates, however they will show hostility towards their own kind and towards other members of the Acanthurus genus - for this reason it is best to house just one specimen per tank. There are good reports of this fish mixing with tangs of other genera; however it is recommended that the Orange Face Tang is the last addition to a set up, as it can be a little territorial to newcomers, especially similar fish species. It is best to source a medium sized specimen (i.e. over 4" in length) as they are more likely to acclimatise well to life in captivity. Conversely, extra large specimens may have a difficult time settling in, so aim for a healthy-looking fish that is neither too small nor excessively large. Avoid any specimens that appear "pinched" in the belly area, and do ask your retailer to show you that your chosen fish is feeding well prior to purchase. Orange Face Tangs have a high metabolism and require small frequent feeds throughout the day. Powerful filtration/circulation and a high level of oxygenation are therefore essential for this energetic, voracious eater. Be sure to keep on top of water quality as this fish will not tolerate deteriorating water conditions. A large refugium with living rock can be most useful: macroalgae can be cultured on this rock and these pieces rotated with pieces from the main tank, so that the Orange Face Tang has a continual supply of natural foodstuffs to graze upon. Take care when handling this species, as the caudal spines are large and can inflict a very painful wound. A period of quarantine can be a valuable procedure for the acclimatisation of all livestock, and it is of particular importance for the Orange Face Tang which can be fairly susceptible to developing marine white spot. This can be difficult to treat in the reef aquarium. Ideally the fish should be quarantined and carefully observed in a separate aquarium for at least a fortnight before being introduced into your main display tank. The pictured fish is a 5" juvenile. As these fish mature, their appearance changes, with the fish developing dazzling golden-orange and bright blue markings to the fins against deeper blues, browns, and black, with a maze of orange freckles on the face. The tail takes on a lunate shape and is covered in many fine black spots, hence the other common name of Black Spot Tang.',feeding:"Feed a varied diet for omnivores, with a large vegetable component, in small amounts several times per day. Although this species will browse on algae within the aquarium, its diet must be supplemented with frozen herbivore rations, green marine flake, Spirulina (blue-green algae), Spirulina-enriched brineshrimp, cucumber, lettuce, broccoli, Nori (dried seaweed) etc. It will also take meaty frozen foods such as Mysis, but be sure that it is receiving enough green food to help prevent HLLE.

This hardy fish is perhaps the most sociable and peaceable of the dottyback species, but it can still be somewhat quarrelsome at times. Despite initial shyness and small size, this dazzling purple species is actually best suited to a moderately aggressive community of medium-sized fish that can look after themselves. Definitely avoid housing with any small, timid fish or hesitant feeders. The aquarium must be mature and should include ample rockwork, arranged so that there is an abundance of small caves, crevices, channels, and overhangs that provide safe, shady retreats for this species. If the aquarium is very spacious, and has plenty of visual barriers amongst the decor, more than one specimen may be kept together if of the same size and introduced simultaneously - however do observe very carefully and separate if necessary. Do not keep with other members of the same genus or close relatives. Will prey on small ornamental shrimps, fanworms, and bristleworms, and will pester small/docile fish (e.g. Anthias, fairy wrasses, firefish, small gobies etc). Species that are not easily bullied e.g. larger angelfish, tangs, hawkfish, and large damselfish, for example, tend to make the best tankmates. The Orchid Dottyback should be the last fish added to the aquarium, otherwise it will show aggression towards any newcomers introduced into what it perceives as its established domain. It will be particularly defensive of its preferred hidey-hole, and even more so when breeding. It is essential that the tank has tight fitting coverslides, as these fish are expert jumpers.

The male entices the female into spawning by performing an elaborate mating dance outside his chosen cave or piece of PVC pipe. If the female accepts the male, she will enter the cave/pipe and deposit several hundred eggs, which are simultaneously fertilised by the male. The male then drives the female away and takes on paternal care of the adhesive eggs, gently fanning them with his pectoral fins and even picking them up and moving them to a new location if he feels they are in danger. The eggs should hatch within 3-5 days (temperature dependent) and they remain in a larval state for around 25-30 days. As soon as the eggs hatch, parental care ceases, so you will need to separate the young from the parents and any other fish in the tank just prior to this event. Raising the larvae to adult fish is possible, but very challenging - you will need a ready supply of miniscule foodstuffs such as rotifers available at all times and water quality/tank hygiene must be continually monitored.

A third, similar looking species, C. cyanospilota is known from the Indian Ocean and Red Sea, and all three species together form what is referred to as the 'Coronata Complex'. Pacific Crowned Pufferfish feed on a wide variety of benthic organisms (including bivalves, brittle stars, bryozoans, crabs, foraminiferans, gastropods, heart urchins, polychaetes, sea urchins, sponges, and tunicates) and as such, are not suitable for reef aquaria. Instead, it is best maintained in a "œfish only, with live rock" set-up where it would pose no danger to corals, ornamental snails, shrimp and other small prized inverts. Tankmates should be chosen carefully; species with long fins should be avoided, as occasional puffer specimens will nip and leave their telltale circular holes in the fins. This behaviour is more likely to become apparent in small tanks, so adequate space must be given. Pacific Crowned Puffers should be kept singly, unless in a known mated pair, and even then, they should be watched carefully lest the male becomes too aggressive.

In the wild, the Peacock Wrasse is found over mixed sand, rubble, and coral areas of lagoons and sheltered seaward reefs to depths of 30m (98ft), where it occurs singly, in pairs, or in large aggregations of females, and is usually observed browsing for molluscs and foraminiferans amongst the substratum. This leopard wrasse requires a very mature, spacious aquarium with plenty of live rock and sand that supports its natural diet on an ongoing basis, if it is to thrive. If added to a newly set up tank, it will starve to death. There should be plenty of hiding places amongst the rockwork, with enough depth of substrate (7.5cm/3" of fine sand) for the fish to bury if it feels threatened. Because of the difficulties in feeding this leopard wrasse, it should not be kept with fish that require a similar food source to survive, as otherwise one species may out-compete the other. There should be relatively calm areas in the tank that allow it to locate food successfully. Tankmates should be peaceful and of an easygoing nature so that the Peacock Wrasse does not feel harassed and subsequently stops venturing out to feed. Groups can sometimes be kept together successfully (added simultaneously) but larger numbers should only ever be considered for exceptionally large aquaria, as in the average sized aquarium, natural prey will deplete too quickly with that many fish requiring the same diet. Do not house with other Macropharyngodon species or pugnacious dottybacks and hawkfish, as they will fight for territory. When choosing your leopard wrasse, check that its body is not emaciated, and that it is actively searching for food. It is not uncommon for a newly added leopard wrasse to hide beneath the substrate whilst it adjusts to its new surroundings and altered circadian rhythm; in such cases it is best to leave them be, they will usually begin to explore within a couple of days.

This is known as protandrous sequential hermaphroditism. In the case of two juvenile specimens in the home aquarium, the larger of the two will become the female. Finally, do not attempt to house Percula Clownfish with the Atlantic Carpet anemone (Condylactis sp.) as they may be consumed, and be aware that these fish are very sensitive to treatment with copper remedies. May also be seen on sale as the Orange Clownfish or the True Percula Clownfish.

Feeding

Offer a varied diet including meaty items such as Mysis shrimp, chopped krill, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp etc, plus herbivore flakes and greenfoods. Feed small amounts 3 times per day. If living with a symbiotic anemone, many clownfish will share their food with them.



The clownfish will clean a smooth rocky surface near to the base of their host anemone. Numerous eggs (numbering between several hundred to a few thousand) will be deposited and the male will aerate them by fanning them with his pectoral fins whilst the female guards them against predators. The eggs will hatch in darkness after 7-10 days, and once free-swimming, the planktonic fry are left to fend for themselves and should be fed on suitably tiny foodstuffs such as live rotifers, moving on to baby brineshrimp after a few days. It is unlikely that fry will survive the attentions of the other fish in a community reef set-up.`,overview:{Synonyms:"Actinicola percula, Amphiprion tunicatus, Lutjanus percula",Distribution:"Western Pacific",MaxiumumSize:'11cm (4.3")',Temperature:"Tropical: 23-27°C",WaterParameters:"SG: 1.020-1.025, pH: 8.1-8.4",Compatibility:"Reef",Lighting:"No special requirements","Reef Aquarium Compatibility":"Excellent","Sexual Dimorphism":"Females of a much larger size than the males."},image_url:"https://www.fishkeeper.co.uk/media//cache/2068x/databank/images/image//Clown_perc_coral_sea_1_2__1.jpg"},{name:"Picasso Triggerfish",care:"",feeding:"",breeding:"",overview:{Synonyms:"Balistapus aculeatus, Balistes aculeatus, Rhinecanthus aculeatus aculeatus",Distribution:"Indo-Pacific",MaxiumumSize:'25cm (9.8")',Temperature:"Tropical: 23-27°C",WaterParameters:"SG: 1.020-1.025, pH: 8.1-8.4",Compatibility:"Non-Reef",Lighting:"No special requirements","Reef Aquarium Compatibility":"Unsuitable","Sexual Dimorphism":"Unknown"},image_url:"https://www.fishkeeper.co.uk/media//cache/2068x/databank/images/image/Picasso-Triggerfish-Rhinecanthus-aculeatus.png"},{name:"Pink Skunk Clownfish",care:`The Pink Skunk Clownfish is known from lagoons and seaward reefs, to depths of 38m (125ft).

Juveniles have been observed amongst floating Sargassum rafts, sub-adults are gregarious and form small groups, whereas adults are solitary. These relatively poor swimmers are nocturnal by nature and feed on crabs, hermit crabs, molluscs, and sea urchins. Young fish display a spotty pattern (particularly prominent on the belly), whereas adults sport dark blotches across the back and spots in between the blotches, the spots becoming fewer with age. This is a popular species for the Fish-Only marine aquarium on account of the fish's rather comical and amiable personality; indeed, many keepers report how these intelligent fish quickly learn to recognise their owners, likening them to "pet dogs", such are their characters and responses to visual stimuli. As Porcupine Pufferfish tend to attain quite a size, a very large tank will be needed to house an adult specimen. Despite its eventual size, this species is relatively gentle for a puffer, although it must still be considered a semi-aggressive fish. Porcupine Pufferfish can be kept in pairs or groups in a vast tank if all fish are of the same size and they are added to the aquarium simultaneously. Tankmates must be of similar size and temperament e.g. large angelfish, large tangs, triggerfish etc. The aquarium should be aquascaped with plenty of rockwork, with some large sized shelters, and an open swimming space along the front. Filtration must be efficient to cope with the voracious eating habits and large amounts of waste that these fish produce, yet water movement should not be too vigorous. Be aware that large pufferfish are notorious for biting through tubing, and even heaters, so it is worth thinking very carefully about where you place your equipment; do also always keep a close eye on where the fish is when carrying out any maintenance in the tank. When frightened, these fish can inflate themselves, causing the long spines to stand erect, which deters predators. This defence mechanism is a last resort, and should never be actively encouraged; it is particularly dangerous if the fish ingests air instead of water. Kept in the right conditions, the Porcupine Pufferfish will become a real "˜pet fish"™ with bags of personality, soon learning to recognise its owner and beg for food. Just don't be tempted to feed directly from your hand "“ always add food a safe distance away, or with tongs!

This species is often observed congregating in sizeable shoals that may extend several metres above the reef, as the fish feed on the abundance of zooplankton that the currents deliver. Hemitaurichthys is an often overlooked genus, containing 4 known species. It is a shame that they are not seen more often in the trade, as these are relatively hardy fish that acclimatise well to aquarium life, and if well fed, they usually pose no problems in reef aquaria that house some of the more noxious soft corals. A number of aquarists have even found them to be completely reef-safe, but as with such matters, "your mileage may vary", and we would recommend exercising caution and careful observation. Pyramid Butterflyfish grow reasonably large and are an active species, so a spacious aquarium that allows room for both ample live rock and a decent swimming space along the front of the tank is requisite. Ideally this peaceful species will be maintained in small groups, as it prefers to live in aggregations - intraspecific aggression should not be an issue here. It is best to try and obtain medium sized specimens of between 7.5 and 12.5cm in length, as these always adapt to aquarium life much more readily than those which are very small or very large. If planning on adding a group (and this is best for their long term wellbeing), try to obtain specimens that are all of roughly equal size, and add all to the tank simultaneously. They should be the only butterflyfish species in the aquarium, and if at all possible, tankmates should be of similar size and temperament. Any fish which could be considered as mildly aggressive should be added after the Pyramid Butterflyfish have established their territories, and only if the tank offers sufficient space and ample visual barriers amongst the rockwork. Never try to house these fish with boisterous feeders as they are likely to intimidate the butterflies at feeding time. Ensure that the water is thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, and provide areas of brisk current. As with all butterflyfishes, they are always going to be much less likely to pick on corals and other invertebrates if they are well fed and given plenty of space and distractions.

Juveniles of the species exhibit cleaning behaviour with a variety of fish, removing ectoparasites from their skin. Adults tend to occur solitary or in pairs, favouring areas rich with corals, seafans, and seawhips, to depths of 70m (230ft). Although the Queen Angelfish feeds predominantly on sponges in the wild, unlike some other members of the genus, they will usually switch to consuming other fare in the home aquarium quite successfully. However, it is still prudent to try and find an ongoing source of frozen sponge-based Angelfish rations for the best long term care. Queen Angelfish will always fare best in spacious, mature aquaria with an abundance of live rock and an open swimming space along the front of the tank. Established systems will provide much more in the way of nutritious micro-invertebrates in the living rock and this will help to supplement the specialised diet. In smaller systems, such critters will be quickly depleted, which is why it is doubly important that this active fish is given ample space. Queen Angelfish demand excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of decent current. Keep only one per tank, and not with any other angelfish. This is a very boisterous species that does best with other semi-aggressive tankmates, and it should be the last fish added to an aquarium. Juvenile specimens are predominantly dark blue with bright yellow chest, pectoral fins, pelvic fins, and tail. The edges of the dorsal and anal fins are royal blue, and there are several light blue, gently curved vertical lines on the flanks. A dark blue mask, edged in royal blue, runs down through the eyes. With age the colour pattern changes: the blue on the flanks becomes brighter and the scales are edged with bright yellow (sometimes giving an overall green appearance when viewed from a distance). The pectoral, pelvic, and caudal fins remain bright yellow, with a large blue spot forming at the base of the pectoral fins. The area on top of the head develops a large black spot that is peppered with electric blue specks and surrounded by an electric blue ring. A series of short blue spines grow down the gill covers, above the main opercular spine on each side. This fish is very similar in appearance to the Blue Angelfish (H. bermudensis) and hybrids of these two species do sometimes occur where their ranges overlap.

Feeding

Should be offered a varied diet consisting mainly of special sponge-based Angelfish preparations (available as frozen cubes), plus meaty fare such as Mysis shrimp, vitamin/Spirulina-enriched brineshrimp, and finely chopped krill/squid/cockle/mussel, plus Spirulina & marine algae. Feed small amounts at least 3 times per day.

Adults tend to occur solitary or in pairs, favouring areas rich with corals, seafans, and seawhips, to depths of 70m (230ft). Although the Queen Angelfish feeds predominantly on sponges in the wild, unlike some other members of the genus, they will usually switch to consuming other fare in the home aquarium quite successfully. However, it is still prudent to try and find an ongoing source of frozen sponge-based Angelfish rations for the best long term care. Queen Angelfish will always fare best in spacious, mature aquaria with an abundance of live rock and an open swimming space along the front of the tank. Established systems will provide much more in the way of nutritious micro-invertebrates in the living rock and this will help to supplement the specialised diet. In smaller systems, such critters will be quickly depleted, which is why it is doubly important that this active fish is given ample space. Queen Angelfish demand excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of decent current. Keep only one per tank, and not with any other angelfish. This is a very boisterous species that does best with other semi-aggressive tankmates, and it should be the last fish added to an aquarium. Juvenile specimens are predominantly dark blue with bright yellow chest, pectoral fins, pelvic fins, and tail. The edges of the dorsal and anal fins are royal blue, and there are several light blue, gently curved vertical lines on the flanks. A dark blue mask, edged in royal blue, runs down through the eyes. With age the colour pattern changes: the blue on the flanks becomes brighter and the scales are edged with bright yellow (sometimes giving an overall green appearance when viewed from a distance). The pectoral, pelvic, and caudal fins remain bright yellow, with a large blue spot forming at the base of the pectoral fins. The area on top of the head develops a large black spot that is peppered with electric blue specks and surrounded by an electric blue ring. A series of short blue spines grow down the gill covers, above the main opercular spine on each side. This fish is very similar in appearance to the Blue Angelfish (H. bermudensis) and hybrids of these two species do sometimes occur where their ranges overlap.



Should be offered a varied diet consisting mainly of special sponge-based Angelfish preparations (available as frozen cubes), plus meaty fare such as Mysis shrimp, vitamin/Spirulina-enriched brineshrimp, and finely chopped krill/squid/cockle/mussel, plus Spirulina & marine algae. Feed small amounts at least 3 times per day.

The Queen Angelfish is a reef dweller known from Florida, USA and the Gulf of Mexico, through the Caribbean, down to Brazil, and over to St Paul's Rocks in the eastern central Atlantic.

Juvenile fish tend to favour rocky inner reef flats or tide pools, but adults have often been observed swimming more out in the open, in pairs or small groups, and feeding on various invertebrates, coral polyps, and algae. In the home aquarium, Raccoon Butterflyfish should be offered plenty of swimming space and a multitude of hiding places. These fish are best kept singly, although if you are blessed with an XXL system, they can be kept in large groups - consisting of same-size fish added simultaneously, to help avoid aggression. Such groups may bicker from time to time, but as long as they are provided with plenty of visual barriers amongst the decor, no real harm should ensue. However, be aware that such groups will not work in smaller quarters. These fish should not be housed with any other butterflyfish species as they will show much hostility towards each other; however, they are usually safe with non-related fish species that can look after themselves (avoid any small, docile species). As mentioned previously, the tanks should contain an abundance of rockwork for the fish to hide amongst, but leave a large open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. As with all butterflies, this species demands excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well-oxygenated, with areas of decent current. Although tending to be of a fairly nocturnal nature in the wild, these fish adapt well to aquarium lighting and feeding schedules and often become very active during the day. Interestingly, the Raccoon Butterflyfish has the ability to change appearance to a dark blotchy form when wanting to blend into its surroundings at night, or when threatened. Juveniles sport a prominent false eye spot towards the top anterior part of the body, which tends to blend in more with the fishs markings as it matures.

These beautiful fish gather in small aggregations amongst crevices, feeding on zooplankton in the water column, but always staying close to cover. Male fish are characteristically territorial and form a harem with a large number of females. This is a great species for the reef tank, and moderately easy to maintain. In the confines of the aquarium, it is best to keep either a solitary specimen, or else a group comprising of a single male and at least 8 females. Unfortunately, smaller groups will result in squabbles, where the weakest fish is likely to be picked on and prevented from feeding, eventually succumbing to being bullied by the others. These large shoals should only be considered if the tank is of XXL proportions "“ if the tank is of average size, it really is best to house a single specimen only. Adults can be kept with moderately pugnacious tankmates such as pygmy angelfish and medium sized tangs etc, as long as the Randall's Anthias are introduced and established first. However, be sure to avoid any large, aggressive species that would prevent the Randall's Anthias from venturing out to feed. These fish are usually perfectly safe in a reef set up, typically ignoring sessile invertebrates. Provide plenty of shady crevices and overhangs amongst the live rock so that these deeper water fish feel secure. Over time, they can become accustomed to brighter lighting, but they should be exposed to more intense illumination very gradually - this is why, when initially introduced, it is so important to provide plenty of refuges from the illumination of the average well-lit reef aquarium. A varied diet is a must to keep the fish in good health and for them to display their vibrant colouration. Ideally they will be fed small amounts several times per day (see below). Powerful filtration and protein skimming, plus a good maintenance regime are essential for maintaining optimal water quality despite the heavy nutrient input. As these fish inhabit areas of great tidal surge in the wild, they require vigorous water movement in the home aquarium - a high level of oxygenation at all times being of utmost importance. Randall"'s Anthias goes through one of the most remarkable colour changes of any Anthias species during the transition from female to male. Females are an overall peach colour on the flanks, which merges into yellow on the tail, around the eye, and on the snout. The dorsal, ventral, and anal fins usually have a very thin blue-purple margin to them. The fins will appear rounded and without filaments, with the exception of the third dorsal ray which may be extended in very mature females or in those females which are transitioning into males. In an aquarium population composed entirely of females, the extension of the third dorsal ray is a certain sign of sex change starting to occur. As a female Randalls Anthias changes into a male, a dramatic colour change occurs. The ventral fins develop a thick red band (as can be seen in the above photographed specimen which was undergoing transition) with yellow centre. At this time, the upper lip extends somewhat, giving the fish a slightly more fat-lipped appearance (this is fairly subtle but more obvious when a male and female are compared side by side). As the change progresses further, the anal, caudal, and dorsal fin tips become more angular and develop long filaments; the anal and dorsal fins turning red and magenta, and the caudal fin changing to a blue-purple hue. The iris also changes from yellow to purple. Much later into the transition, the fish eventually develops thick horizontal bands of red and magenta on the flanks. May also be seen on sale as Randall's Fairy Basslet.`,feeding:"In the wild, this species is constantly on the lookout for food, taking zooplankton from the water column.

This bottom dwelling species is most often found in association with the cidaroid sea urchin Eucidaris thouarsii, and is a facultative cleaner of other fishes. This is a charming little fish that makes a wonderful addition to the reef aquarium. With pretty colouration and a peaceful nature, Red Head Gobies have been known to reproduce in captivity, so would make for an interesting breeding project. As previously mentioned, Red Head Gobies are regularly observed servicing fish that have ectoparasites, helping to control diseases such as Lymphocystis and marine whitespot. An advantage over most other cleaner fishes is that the Red Head Goby is not an "obligate cleaner" (i.e. it does not rely on cleaning/eating parasites for optimal health). As such, the Red Head Goby will do just as well in a healthy aquarium where it is offered quality commercially prepared foodstuffs. This diminutive goby rarely shows aggression towards other species, although it will fight with members of its own kind, especially in smaller aquaria where space and territories are more limited. Large groups (7+) can be kept if the system is spacious; however in smaller aquaria it is advisable to keep either a single specimen or a known mated pair. Although these gobies cannot be sexed externally, it is often fairly easy to pick out a compatible pair at your local aquarium store as they may have paired off and be resting very close to one another. With regards to compatibility, Red Head Gobies are ideal for community reef aquaria; they are also often purported to coexist with a number of unlikely large predators, which usually tend to leave the gobies alone on account of their known cleaning services. However, much caution is necessary as all fish vary in personality and temperament and there can be no guarantees when it comes to their safety with such tankmates present. Observe carefully and if in any doubt, do not add them to your aquarium. It is not advisable to add Red Head Gobies to an aquarium containing predatory crabs.

You will need to ensure that the eggs are very gently aerated in the absence of the parent fish. The time it takes for the eggs to hatch will vary depending on water temperature and other factors, but on average this is usually around 8 days.

The Red Velvet Fairy Wrasse is known from the Chagos and Maldives Archipelagos where it is typically found at deep reef slopes over coral, rubble, or sandy substrates, at depths between 40-50m (131-164ft). Juveniles are often seen shoaling in groups with adult females and one adult male, along with other species of Cirrhilabrus or Paracheilinus wrasses, as they feed on zooplankton in the water column. This is a variable fish in terms of looks; the anterior part of the body is rosy red in colouration, fading to a peach or pale pink colour posteriorly. As the fish mature, the red scales at the front end of the fish develop dark edges. The colouration of the fins is also variable, with the dorsal usually bright red or orange anteriorly, and the other fins a mixture of peach or pale pink with blue-purple fin rays. There is a light blue margin to the anal fin and the posterior of the dorsal fin, along with a thin blue marking through the caudal fin. Dominant males will be much more vibrantly coloured compared to the females, and during courtship rituals, the males can undergo spectacular colour changes within seconds, turning almost white in order to attract a mate. In the home aquarium, it is best to keep either a single specimen or a group consisting of just one male with several females. Be sure to add the entire group simultaneously, or else add all females before the male. In the confines of the aquarium, large males will behave aggressively towards other fairy wrasses and other small wrasse species introduced after them. Unless you are blessed with a system of vast proportions, never attempt to keep more than one male together. The tank should be aquascaped with plenty of live rock, in order for the fish to have ample places to hide amongst should they feel threatened. Newly acclimatised fish may be quite shy, but in the presence of peaceful tankmates, they should soon gain much confidence and swim out in open water areas. It is best not to house the Red Velvet Fairy Wrasse with large, intimidating species such as some of the bigger Angels and Tangs. Likewise, do not keep alongside small timid planktivores such as dottybacks, as the Red Velvet Fairy Wrasse can be a little boisterous and competitive at feeding times. Provide your fish with consistently high water quality, decent current, and plenty of aeration. Tight fitting coverslides are an absolute must as these fish are expert jumpers. You may sometimes see this fish labelled as the Rosy-scales Fairy Wrasse.

Feeding

Feed a variety of meaty foods in small amounts several times per day, including Mysis shrimp, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, finely chopped krill, and plankton. Over time, may also learn to accept flake foods.

As with other members of the same genus, this goby forms a symbiotic partnership with an almost blind alpheid shrimp; together they share the safety of a burrow which the shrimp digs/maintains, and the goby keeps watch for predators. Whilst the shrimp is working, it maintains antennal contact with its goby partner posted at the entrance of the shared burrow. If the shrimp detects the quivering motion of the goby's caudal fin during an unusual situation, it reacts by immediately withdrawing into the depths of the burrow. The entrance to the shared burrow will be closed at night, and only one entrance is usually open at any one time. The shrimp will only emerge from the burrow whilst it can have tactile contact with the goby. These fish are peaceful, and may be kept in groups if all are added simultaneously when juvenile; when keeping more than one, do ensure that there are plenty of visual barriers amongst the decor. Provided with a reasonable depth of coral sand and a good selection of loose coral rubble pieces that vary in size (not too big to be moved) these hardy little candy-striped gobies will do very well in the home aquarium. A shrimp partner is not strictly necessary, but if they can be acquired together, they will make such a fascinating display, captivating the observer for hours on end. The usual shrimp that partners the Red-banded Goby is Alpheus ochrostriatus, but these gobies often accept different Alpheus spp. if a specific one cannot be found. Your dealer may be able to acquire the two together, it is certainly worth asking. Tankmates should be of a peaceable nature, and be aware that the goby may predate on smaller species of ornamental shrimp. Ensure that the tank has tight fitting coverslides, as these gobies are accomplished jumpers.

This is a delicate species which is best kept in a mature reef aquarium, following very careful acclimatisation. The tank should be aquascaped with plenty of live rock, creating lots of shady hidey holes and overhangs (do ensure these are secure). The more places of safety available to these fish, the more you will see them out in the open, as they will learn that they can quickly retreat if necessary. Filtration should be efficient, with areas of brisk water movement, and some calmer resting spots out of the current. Red-spot Cardinalfish are a shoaling species and really should be maintained in small groups of at least 5-7 specimens, introduced simultaneously. Keeping these fish in decent numbers will not only make the fish less nervous, but will also result in a more effective, natural-looking display. It is important that tankmates are of a peaceful nature; they should not include large, carnivorous, or intimidating species (the latter which may prevent the cardinals from feeding). Unlike a number of their relatives, this species is not a threat towards other small fishes and crustaceans. As with many cardinals, these large-eyed fish are active during the evening/night, and a period of blue moon lighting will enable you to observe their antics more closely after the main tank lights have been switched off.

Feeding

Offer a variety of meaty items such as Mysis shrimp, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, finely chopped krill etc. Feed small amounts 3 times per day, with at least one of the feeds after lights out.

Breeding

The Red-spot Cardinalfish has not been bred in the home aquarium. This species forms distinct pairs during courtship and spawning. The male fish will mouthbrood the egg mass until hatching. The larvae are then released into the water column, where they develop for some weeks before settling out of the plankton. Once released, there is no further parental care.`,feeding:`Care

Here, they feed on algae and small invertebrates and spend a good portion of their time in small crevices with just their heads protruding, keeping a watchful eye on their surroundings. The Red-spot Flymo is often regarded as a utility fish for helping to control various algal growths in the aquarium. However, these are very personable fish and are fascinating to observe, regardless of their excellent ability at removing and consuming algae. The tank must be well established, and of a good size; these combtooth blennies have been known to starve in smaller quarters once the main food source has been depleted and not had time to re-establish. When Red-spot Flymo blennies feed, skip over rocks, graze dÃ©cor and generally go about their business, they tend to stir up detritus where it goes into suspension and is then removed by the filtration. Ensure that the tank has efficient filtration with areas of brisk water movement (in order to simulate the surge-like conditions this fish favours) along with some calmer resting spots out of the current. As this species requires a mature tank, it works out well that this should be the last fish added to the tank, preferably at a size around 2.5" where it should not be over-dominant. However, in general, Red-spot Flymo blennies can be fairly feisty and quite territorial over the bottom of the aquarium, particularly as they mature; therefore it is best to keep only one per tank, and careful consideration given to tankmates - avoiding other blennies and similar-looking bottom dwelling species such as gobies (unless you are blessed with a tank of vast proportions incorporating a huge number of visual barriers amongst the rockwork, and more than enough food to go round on a continual basis). It should be noted that the Red-spot Flymo will not feed on every kind of algae - they particularly relish the filamentous type, but will ignore bubble and slime algae. Ensure corals are firmly attached, as large blennies may disturb them with their feeding habits and when hopping about looking for a suitable perch from which they can survey their domain. May also be seen on sale as the Red Spotted Blenny.

Feeding

By far and away, this species does best if a decent growth of filamentous algae is present in the aquarium for the fish to harvest at its leisure. Also offer plenty of vegetable matter, including frozen foods that contain marine algae and Spirulina. Nori (dried seaweed), algae flake and algae wafers formulated for marine fish are usually met with much enthusiasm. If you have space in a well lit sump, filamentous algae can be cultured on pieces of rock, and occasionally rotated with some of the pieces in the main display aquarium.

They have been observed swimming in small, loose aggregations among the inner reefs where brittle corals and coralline algae flourish, an area shared by damselfishes and small wrasses. In the home aquarium, this diminutive angel can be surprisingly territorial, and so it is best kept in a large tank with plenty of live rockwork that has a multitude of visual barriers and bolt holes. Unfortunately, this fish will nip at quite a range of invertebrate life, so it is not suitable for every setup. Live rock is considered essential though, as it will provide the fish with ongoing grazing opportunities. Keep only one specimen per tank, and not with any other angelfish from the Centropyge genus. We recommend that the Royal Blue Pygmy Angelfish is the last addition to an aquarium, as otherwise, it can be extremely territorial when introducing new tankmates into what it perceives as its established domain. Tankmates should not be too docile, being able to "look after themselves", but at the same time, not so large and predatory that they see the angelfish as prey. The colour of this species is quite variable. Juveniles are typically bright royal blue to black with a pale or hyaline caudal fin, and adults can range from being dark brown/almost black to a golden brown colour.

It is usually observed in small harems, comprised of one male and several females, browsing the substrate for molluscs and foraminiferans. This elongate wrasse is one of 11 currently known species of Pseudojuloides, and although all are incredibly beautiful, this genus is considered rather delicate and does have some specialist care requirements that must be fulfilled by the advanced aquarist if these fish are to acclimatise well to life in captivity. The Royal Pencil Wrasse requires a very mature, spacious aquarium with plenty of healthy live rock and sand that supports its natural diet on an ongoing basis, if it is to thrive. If added to a newly set up tank, it will starve to death. There should be plenty of hiding places amongst the rockwork, with enough depth of substrate (7.5cm/3" of fine sand) for the fish to bury if it feels threatened. Because of the difficulties in feeding this wrasse, it should not be kept with fish that require a similar food source to survive, as otherwise one species may out-compete the other. There should be relatively calm areas in the tank that allow it to locate food successfully. Tankmates should be peaceful and of an easygoing nature so that the Royal Pencil Wrasse does not feel harassed and subsequently stops venturing out to feed. Keep only one male per tank; groups, comprised of one male and several females, can sometimes be kept together successfully (added simultaneously) but larger numbers should only ever be considered for exceptionally voluminous aquaria, as in the average sized aquarium, natural prey will deplete too quickly with that many fish requiring the same diet. Do not house with different Pseudojuloides species, other wrasses, or pugnacious dottybacks and hawkfishes, as they will fight for territory. When choosing your Royal Pencil Wrasse, check that its body is not emaciated, and that it is actively searching for food. It is not uncommon for a newly added pencil wrasse to hide beneath the substrate whilst it adjusts to its new surroundings and altered circadian rhythm; in such cases it is best to leave them be, they will usually begin to explore within a couple of days. These fish require stable and optimal water conditions at all times, so a good filtration and maintenance regime is a must. Ensure that the aquarium has tight fitting coverslides with no small gaps in the hood, as these fish are expert jumpers.

This diminutive, bright scarlet and yellow fish is found amongst areas of broken coral rubble that is interspersed with outcrops of soft and stony corals, to depths of 38m (125ft). Like its close relative, the Scooter Blenny, this species has an interesting method of locomotion, using oversized ventral fins to "scoot" along the substrate and habitually perch as it feeds on microfauna. Although this fish has been seen in the trade for several years, it has only recently been formally described. When keeping the Ruby Red Dragonet in the home aquarium, it is vitally important that the tank is fully mature, with plenty of live rock and a living sand bed which will provide the fish with natural foodstuffs. For this reason, although Ruby Red Dragonets do not grow especially large, an aquarium with a decent footprint (length and width) is important to provide enough food on a continual basis. Without such nourishment, these fish tend to waste away. In larger aquaria, multiple specimens can be kept together in the same tank, ideally one male, with several females - all of which should be introduced simultaneously. The male will use his elaborate dorsal fin to display to the females during courtship rituals. If more than one male is present, the rivals will both use their dorsal fins as a show of dominance. To keep more than one male in the same tank, the aquarium must be of generous proportions, with plenty of visual barriers, and the specimens added simultaneously when juvenile. Tankmates should be small and peaceful, so that the Ruby Red Dragonet is not bullied or harassed at feeding times. Do not keep with anemones, as these docile bottom dwellers are likely to be consumed. The Red Ruby Dragonet (S. sycorax) is very similar in appearance to S. tudorjonesi from Cenderawasih Bay, Indonesia, although the latter tends to lack the intense yellow colour of the ventral and pectoral fins, the white markings on the head, and has much reduced white markings over the body. In addition, the first dorsal-fin spine is the longest in S. sycorax, whereas the third spine is longest in S. tudorjonesi.

Here the adults are often observed grazing on algae in aggregations of around 20 individuals, whereas the juveniles are solitary and stay closer to coral cover. In the confines of the home aquarium, established Tangs can become rather territorial and so must be provided with a generously sized tank - as not only is ample swimming space required, but specimens kept in smaller quarters can become very aggressive. It is easiest to keep to just one Zebrasoma in the aquarium, as they don't often accept other members of the same genus. Other tangs from different genera (such as the Regal Tang or Lipstick Tang) with a visibly different appearance may be accepted if the fish are added simultaneously. The tank should be mature with plenty of algal growth for these herbivores to browse, especially filamentous types which the fish will harvest effortlessly using their long snouts and specialised pharyngeal teeth. It is of utmost importance that they receive an appropriate diet consisting of a variety of greenfoods, in order to prevent Head & Lateral Line Erosion (HHLE). As long as this fish is kept well fed, it should not pose any problems in a reef set up. Occasional specimens have been known to nip at stony corals, and even some soft corals, but this is not the norm. A decent current and highly oxygenated conditions will serve this fish well. Provide plenty of hiding/sleeping places amongst the rockwork, with an open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Juveniles sport yellowish bars and prominent yellow specks on the body, as well as oversized dorsal fins. Adults are usually dark brown posteriorly with fine pale blue-green longitudinal lines following scale rows, which gradually become white dots anteriorly on the body and head. There are also many natural geographical colour variants, including black, grey, or greenish, and some individuals also exhibit blotched patterns of more than one colour, including yellow. It has been noted that many such blotched individuals can change colour/pattern over time in the aquarium, so may not retain the same appearance as when first bought. In addition, the Scopas Tang is fairly similar in appearance to the Black Tang (Z. rostratum), and in the wild where their ranges overlap, hybrids between the two occur.

These groups are composed mainly of females and juveniles, the males being more solitary. This is a peaceful, active fish that is well suited to reef aquaria. The attractive colouration varies greatly depending on the collection location and on the fish's mood. The fish in the photograph above is a Fijian specimen; the fish from Australian waters tend to have less black and more orange/red in the fins, and those from the Cook Islands typically show more blue on the body, a bright red patch on the flanks, and less dark colouration in the dorsal fin. In the home aquarium, it is essential to provide Scott's Fairy Wrasse with consistently high water quality, decent current, and plenty of aeration. Provide an abundance of hiding places amongst live rock; these fish may be quite shy initially, but should soon gain confidence. Keep only one male per tank and if planning on keeping a group (comprising one male and several females), be sure to add the entire group simultaneously, or else add all females before the male. Large males will behave aggressively towards other fairy wrasses and other small wrasse species introduced after them. It has been known for adult males to lose some of their colouration in captivity when they are maintained alone, and keeping a small harem tends to prevent this from occurring. Do not attempt to house with intimidating fish such as larger species of Angels and Tangs as their presence may make the fairy wrasses feel threatened and then refuse to come out and feed. Having said that, they can eventually become quite boisterous at feeding times, so ensure that any passive feeders do not miss out.

In the wild, the peaceful Snake Pipefish is known from calm reef flats and lagoons (and sometimes the deeper portions of seaward reefs that are not disturbed by the pummelling wave action further above) over sandy or mixed sand and rubble substrates. Here these curious syngnathids may be observed in pairs or small aggregations, slinking along just above the substrate in a manner akin to a 'horizontal seahorse', feeding on various tiny benthic crustaceans. The home aquarium must be tailored specifically to their needs. Filtration should be thorough, but water movement gentle. Ensure that these fish cannot be drawn against filter intakes or blown into the decor by current that is too vigorous. Provide plenty of shady overhangs amongst living rock, and shelter in the form of gorgonians, coral skeletons, marine plants and the like. Best maintained in pairs or small groups. May also be seen on sale as Scribbled Pipefish, Messmate Pipefish, or Dragon Pipefish.`,feeding:"Can be very challenging to feed. This species MUST be provided with natural prey on an ongoing basis. Live rock is always recommended, but a more constant supply of tiny live foods for this purpose can be reliably cultured in a fishless refugium. New additions often readily take live brineshrimp (try to gut load them first), but this alone does not provide enough sustenance. These fish should be weaned onto Mysis shrimp as soon as possible. Most specimens will refuse frozen foods, so be prepared to culture your own copepods, isopods, amphipods, Mysids etc. Feed several times daily, and ensure they are not being out competed for food by unsuitable tankmates.",breeding:"Snake Pipefish may attempt to breed in the home aquarium. Courtship behaviour prior to spawning often involves elaborately choreographed displays and heightened colouration. These fish are external brooders. The male carries the eggs in his ventral brood pouch whilst they develop. Once released, the minuscule fry are free-swimming, but at great risk from predation by the adults.

Here, this elongate bottom-dweller may be found in the narrow nooks and crannies between rocks and corals, at a maximum depth of 48m (158ft), but is most commonly encountered at around 10m (33ft) or less. It forages mainly at night on crustaceans but will also take small fishes. The aquarium should be spacious and mature, with a soft sandy substrate. Most importantly, it should be securely covered to prevent the eel escaping on to the floor. Create plenty of narrow, shady refuges in the rockwork that the eel can explore and hide amongst, ensuring that all decor is stable and cannot be undermined. Suitable crevices should have a fairly narrow entrance hole but be roomy enough behind for the eel to conceal its entire body within. Most of the day will be spent with its head projecting from this favoured shelter. Unfortunately, this fish is not recommended for reef aquaria, as ornamental crustaceans and small fishes may be eaten, and corals that are not securely attached to the rockwork may be accidentally toppled. The Snowflake Moray grows large and is a voracious eater, so ensure that the filtration/protein skimming is very efficient and capable of coping with the erratic loading that results from big meals and subsequent spikes in waste output. Circulation should be good, with areas of brisk water movement and some calmer resting spots out of the current. This fish is normally mild-mannered, but becomes somewhat frenzied at feeding times - resist the temptation to hand feed youngsters, as adults that associate fingers with food are something of a liability! Can be kept in groups if space allows, but do ensure all specimens are of the same size and are added simultaneously, as newcomers added at a later date are rarely accepted. Tankmates can include many medium-large sized fish that thrive in a similar set up. The Snowflake Moray Eel is an excellent candidate for those willing to set-up a tank around its specific needs and combines all the appeal of an eel in a fairly manageable package.",feeding:`May occasionally be seen as Clouded or Starry Moray.



Offer a variety of meaty foods including Mysis shrimp, krill, prawns, cockle, mussel, squid, crab meat, chunks of white fish etc. Always use tongs for target feeding - this fish has sharp dentition and can give a nasty bite as it lunges for food. Live feeder shrimps are relished and can be boosted by gutloading with a good dried food prior to being introduced. To ensure nutritional deficiencies are avoided, use a multivitamin supplement regularly for fish that don't take dried food.

Offer a varied diet consisting of small frozen foods such as Spirulina-enriched brineshrimp, Mysis shrimp and finely chopped krill, plus marine flake food and herbivore rations. Feed small amounts 3 times per day.

Breeding

This species has not been bred in the home aquarium, but they are known to form distinct pairs in the wild when spawning.

This charming little fish is one of the least aggressive of the dotty back species, and it makes a wonderful addition to reef aquaria where no small ornamental crustaceans are present. Be aware that adults will eat small shrimp, but they will also prey on many invertebrate pests; small fireworms are consumed with relish. The aquarium must be mature and should include ample rockwork, arranged so that there is an abundance of small caves, crevices, channels, and overhangs that provide safe, shady retreats for this species. Sunrise Dottybacks generally mix well with other community-type reef inhabitants, but occasional specimens can be a little territorial (although this is more likely to occur in smaller aquaria where space/hiding places are at a premium). Nevertheless, they should be one of the last species introduced to the tank. Do not house with any large, aggressive species, as the dotty back will be very easily intimidated and may refuse to come out and feed, leading to starvation. If the aquarium is very spacious and has plenty of visual barriers amongst the decor, more than one specimen may be kept together if of the same size and introduced simultaneously. However, if the system is on the smaller side, it really is best to keep just one specimen and not with any easily bullied tankmates.

They are closely associated with both the Bubble Anemone (Entacmaea quadricolor) and the Sebae Anemone (Heteractis crispa), that afford them lifelong protection from predators and skin parasites. This is a popular and robust aquarium fish which thrives in mature reef aquaria. A host anemone - some of which can be a little tricky to maintain successfully in captivity - is not strictly necessary for your clownfish as most reef set ups contain plenty of hiding places, no large predatory fish, and sometimes cleaner shrimp/cleaner wrasse. In the absence of an anemone, some clownfish take up residence in what they see as a suitable coral substitute - which may cause them to retract in irritation as the clownfish wallow - but this isn"™t always the case. Many species of clownfish (including the Tomato) are now captive-raised, so wherever possible the conscientious aquarist should aim to source these hardier specimens for the home aquarium, in turn helping to take pressure off the reefs. This is a colourful species, with a vivid tomato red-orange coloured body and a vertical white stripe behind the eyes. Captive raised fish tend to be slightly darker in colouration when young, but soon turn a bright orange-red. As these fish can be somewhat territorial, keep only one pair per tank, providing them with ample space and plenty of visual barriers amongst the decor. It is also best not to mix this species with other species of clownfish as they will fight. With regards to sexing, all clownfish are born as males. A wild colony may consist of a breeding pair, which cohabit with a few non-reproductive smaller male specimens. When the female dies, the dominant male will change sex and become the female. This is known as protandrous sequential hermaphroditism. In the case of two juvenile specimens in the home aquarium, the larger of the two will become the female. Please be aware that these fish are very sensitive to treatment with copper remedies.',feeding:"Offer a varied diet including meaty items such as Mysis shrimp, krill, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp etc, plus herbivore flakes and greenfoods.",breeding:"Tomato Clownfish have been bred in captivity. Prior to spawning, the male will begin biting at the substrate in increasing frequency and intensity in the hopes of attracting a female. If a ripe female accepts him, she may join him with the substrate biting (although the female does not always do this). The pair will then choose a spawning site, usually a smooth rocky surface such as a flat wall inside a cave, and if a host anemone is present, the spawning site will usually be within close vicinity for protection. Several hundred elliptical red-coloured eggs will be deposited. These adhere to the substrate via fine threads at the ventral pole, and the male will aerate them by fanning them with his pectoral fins whilst guarding against predators. The eggs will hatch after 7-10 days, and the larvae typically settle after another 9 days or so. The tiny fry are left to fend for themselves and should be fed on suitably tiny foodstuffs such as live rotifers, moving on to baby brineshrimp after a few days. It is unlikely that fry will survive the attentions of the other fish in a community reef set-up.

Adults usually swim solitary or in small harems as they cruise amongst large corals, whereas the smaller juvenile fish stay even closer to the reef and swim with their heads down and dorsal and anal fins held erect, so as to make themselves appear much larger to any predators (when viewed side-on, the fish resembles the face of a bigger fish, largely due to the prominent eyespots). These attractive fish require a spacious, mature aquarium with plenty of live rock to both browse upon and hide amongst, plus a decent sand bed "ideally 7.5cm (3") deep or more - in which to bury at night or if startled. No matter how often these fish are offered frozen or dried foods, they will starve in a tank without an abundance of mature rockwork, so it is absolutely essential that this is provided; the fish will prey on the micro-fauna that live amongst the rock, such as tiny shrimps, amphipods, copepods, and small crustaceans, which are easily crushed with its powerful pharyngeal teeth.

Effective filtration and circulation with a high level of oxygenation are a must in order to maintain optimal water conditions. Tight-fitting coverslides are also essential, as these fish are expert jumpers. Keep only one per tank, unless you can acquire a mated pair or a harem that consists of just one male and several females; the latter two options requiring a vast aquarium.

Offer small amounts of food several times per day, target feeding if necessary.

Breeding

In the wild, these fish form monogamous pairs, and the onset of spawning is synchronous with semi-lunar phases. This species has spawned in the home aquarium, but raising the microscopic larvae is extremely challenging. The male will construct a suitable burrow and will entice the female to spawn inside. Once the egg mass has been laid/fertilised, the male drives off the female and guards the cave until the eggs hatch, which is usually at around 72-96 hours (temperature dependent).

Ensure that there are plenty of hiding places amongst the reef structure for the Whitecheek Tang to retreat into if necessary, particularly during the settling in period when it may be a little shy. Water quality must be maintained to consistently high standards, as, like some other members of this family, the Whitecheek Tang is susceptible to whitespot, which can be difficult to treat in the reef aquarium. This is an agile fish that appreciates a good amount of swimming space and a decent current. There is a very similar looking species, the Powder Brown Tang (Acanthurus japonicus), known from the Western Pacific. Both species have been sold under the Gold Rimmed Tang nametag, and so it is best to use the scientific name to avoid confusion. Interestingly, in some parts of its natural range, the Whitecheek Tang is known to hybridise with the Achilles Tang (A. achilles).

Feeding

Can be finicky. Offer a varied diet, consisting mainly of vegetable matter, in small amounts 3 times per day. Although this species will browse on algae within the aquarium, its diet must be supplemented with frozen herbivore rations, green marine flake, Spirulina (blue-green algae), Spirulina-enriched brineshrimp, cucumber, lettuce, Nori (dried seaweed) etc. It will also take small meaty frozen foods, but be sure that it is receiving enough green food to prevent HLLE.

The Whitecheek Tang is known from clear lagoons and seaward reefs, from the lower surge zone down to 67m (220ft). Here, these fish feed primarily on filamentous algae - the juveniles gregarious amongst large coral heads, and the territorial adults more solitary. This is a very delicate fish, suitable for advanced aquarists only.

Juveniles are often associated with weedy areas of estuaries where there is ample cover for them to develop in relative safety. Adults are usually solitary and fairly territorial. They typically feed on various types of algae (including coralline), mollusks, crabs, tunicates, sponges, corals, zoanthids, tube worms, and echinoderms; feeding on hard prey keeps the beak from overgrowing. Therefore due to such eating habits, these fish are not suitable for keeping in a reef setting in the home aquarium. As Whitespotted Pufferfish tend to attain quite a size, a very large tank will be needed to house an adult specimen. Despite its eventual size, this species is relatively gentle for a puffer, although it must still be considered a semi-aggressive fish. Keep only one per tank and not with any other pufferfish; ideally, tankmates will be of similar size and temperament. The aquarium should be aquascaped with plenty of rockwork, with some large-sized shelters, and an open swimming space along the front. Filtration must be efficient to cope with the voracious eating habits and large amounts of waste that these fish produce, yet water movement should not be too vigorous. Be aware that large pufferfish are notorious for biting through tubing, and even heaters, so it is worth thinking very carefully about where you place your equipment; do also always keep a close eye on where the fish is when carrying out any maintenance in the tank. The general coloration of the White-spotted Pufferfish is an overall grey-brown, with the back, sides, and caudal fin speckled with white spots. The belly area is marked with white stripes. These markings lend themselves to the alternative common name of the Stars and Stripes Puffer. As the fish mature, the white spots appear smaller in proportion to the rest of the fish. When frightened, these fish can inflate themselves to more than twice their original size to deter predators. This defense mechanism is a last resort, and should never be actively encouraged; it is particularly dangerous if the fish ingests air instead of water. Kept in the right conditions, the Whitespotted Puffer will become a real "pet fish" with bags of personality, soon learning to recognize its owner and beg for food. Just don't be tempted to feed directly from your hand always add food a safe distance away, or with tongs!`,feeding:"Offer a varied diet consisting mainly of meaty items such as vitamin-enriched krill, prawns, cockle, mussel, whitebait, squid, and clam meat. Hard-shelled foods such as cockle-in-shell and crab legs should be given regularly to help keep the beak worn down. A decent amount of living in the tank will also give the puffer lots of browsing opportunities which will also help to keep the beak in check.",breeding:"This species has not been bred in the home aquarium.

These solitary fish are considered relatively poor swimmers and for this reason, developed protection via toxin release. Unfortunately, keeping YellowBoxfish in the home aquarium is very risky. This is a species notorious for readily excreting the poison ostracitoxin when stressed - a deadly toxin that is capable of wiping out an entire tank. Never keep more than one in the same tank as bickering and subsequent ostracitoxin release is very likely to occur. If tankmates are desired, they must be peaceful so as not to harass the boxfish; however, their continued safety will be precarious, hence why an aspecies-only set up is highly recommended. These fish have impressive teeth which are used to scrape algae (containing various microorganisms) tunicates and sponges off of rocks, and this forms the bulk of the diet along with various bivalves, snails, polychaete worms, mollusks, foraminiferans, and small fishes. For this reason, Yellow Boxfish are not suited to reef tanks, although there should be some live rock in the tank to provide welcome shelters and grazing opportunities. The tank must be very spacious and a large open swimming area should be provided so that the boxfish is able to swim out and about during daylight hours when usually they are at their most active. Despite their less-than-nimble method of locomotion, Yellow Boxfish is capable of jumping from open-topped tanks, so tight-fitting coverslides are a must. Care must be taken when carrying out maintenance on the aquarium, so as to keep the fish as calm as possible. Ideally, the tank will be situated where there is as little traffic going past as possible. Lights should turn on and off very gradually via the use of a dimmer - sudden bright light can shock the boxfish into toxin release. All foods should be offered towards the bottom of the tank to avoid the boxfish drawing in air when trying to take food from the surface. Boxfish have very small mouths and stomachs and it is of extreme importance that they are fed small amounts throughout the day to prevent starvation(something which may not always be immediately apparent because of the rigid bony plates along the sides of the boxfish). On account of this feeding regime, highly efficient filtration and protein skimming is a must. Juveniles (as pictured above) are bright yellow with black spots; but as the fish grows, the spots disappear and the fish takes on a blue-grey appearance with patches of subdued yellow. Although many an aquarist has been charmed by colourful young boxfish with their engaging, curious personalities, and somewhat cute method of locomotion, these fish are not suitable for beginners.",feeding:"An omnivorous species that should be offered small meaty frozen foods such as Mysis shrimp, Spirulinaenriched brineshrimp, chopped prawns/krill/mussel/cockle/clam/squid etc as well as herbivore foods including marine algae.

The modified ventral fins have fused to form a kind of suction cup that helps them to maintain position on coral branches in swift currents. Yellow Coral Gobies are generally of a peaceful nature and make a wonderful addition to mature reef aquaria containing established colonies of broad-branching SPS corals, which they very much enjoy hiding amongst. Although often recommended for nano aquaria because of its diminutive size, caution should be exercised for two reasons. Firstly, smaller tanks will limit the number of individuals you can keep together; only one specimen is recommended in small nano type tanks, otherwise there will be constant arguments over territory which could result in the untimely demise of the weaker individual. Secondly, the more space available in a reef setting, the chances are that there will be much larger, stable colonies of suitable SPS corals available, and so it is less likely that these fish will damage any one individual beyond repair as they go about their daily routines (hiding/resting amongst the branches, and feeding on the occasional mucous polyp). If these types of corals are not being cultivated in your aquarium, invest in several coral skeletons so that these fish have something natural to interact with and give them a sense of security. Yellow Coral Gobies may be kept in groups (but only in larger quarters where there is an abundance of hiding places/territories), and oftentimes these fish will pair up and spawn. With regards to tankmates, these should all be small, non-aggressive feeders. These gobies actually produce a thick toxic body slime that deters many species from trying to consume them. Having said that, obviously do not house these fish with large carnivores. May also be seen on sale as the Yellow Clown Goby.

Feeding

Will consume a wide range of meaty fare including Mysis shrimp, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, finely chopped krill/prawns etc. Feed small amounts 3 times per day, target feeding if necessary.

Breeding

It is fairly common for the Yellow Coral Goby to spawn in the home aquarium; however, raising the young is extremely challenging. These fish are bi-directional protogynous hermaphrodites (which is sometimes referred to as a bi-directional sex change), which is an uncommon trait among gobies, meaning that any two fish placed together are guaranteed to form a male-female pair. These fish tend to strip a small area of coral polyps in order to create a place to deposit their eggs, although other sites are not unheard of. The male fish will dance/quiver in front of the female and when she is ready to spawn, she will deposit her eggs on the coral branch, and these are immediately fertilised and subsequently guarded by the male. The eggs are very small (less than 1mm in diameter) and can number several hundred. The presence of the eggs on the coral may cause a small amount of tissue recession in that area, but this should recover quickly once the eggs have hatched (4-5 days, dependent on water temperature). The larvae are miniscule and require appropriately sized foodstuffs such as cultured rotifers and copepods.`,feeding:`Care

An aquarium that has some areas of lush filamentous algae growth will also aid your new fish in settling into its new surroundings; however, as with other butterflyfish species, these fish demand excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of brisk current. Some aquarists have successfully kept the Yellow Teardrop Butterflyfish alongside some of the more noxious soft corals, but this is something of a risk, and they should be observed carefully. Stony corals and many other sessile invertebrates will be constantly nipped at, so unfortunately must be avoided. Keep only one Yellow Teardrop Butterflyfish per tank (unless a mated pair is acquired) and not with any other butterflyfish as they will squabble over territories. Whilst they can be rather shy when first introduced, providing them with ample retreats amongst the live rock should ensure they eventually gain confidence and venture out into the open much more. Tankmates should be of similar size and temperament; it is imperative that boisterous companions are avoided if this fish is to settle in and feed. There are two different butterflyfish species commonly known as 'teardrop butterflyfish', C. interruptus that is featured here, and C. unimaculatus. At one time, these two fish were considered regional variations of the same species (C. unimaculatus), but they have significant colour differences and their natural ranges do not overlap, so they are now considered two separate species.

Feeding

Offer a wide variety of foods, fed in small amounts several times per day. Frozen foods such as Angel & Butterfly mix, Mysis shrimp, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, finely chopped clam/mussel/cockle/crab/shrimp/squid etc should be given, along with some greenfoods. Ensure the larger foodstuffs are chopped into small enough pieces on account of butterflyfish having tiny mouths.

Breeding

This species has not been bred in captivity. In the wild, these fish form distinct pairs and scatter their eggs in open water where they are dispersed by the currents.`,feeding:`Care

The Yellow Teardrop Butterflyfish is present in a wide range of habitats, from coral reef flats to clear lagoons, and deep sloping drop-offs. Adult fish may be seen in pairs or small aggregations, to depths of 40m (131ft). Here they may be observed feeding on coral fragments, filamentous algae, polychaetes, small crustaceans, and sponges. A good-sized, mature system is requisite, along with ample live rock for the fish to browse upon/hide amongst and a large open swimming space along the front of the aquarium.

This is a species that shoals in sizeable aggregations as it feeds on zooplankton in the water column, with one male fish overseeing a large harem of females. This is a fairly delicate species that is suitable for advanced aquarists only. In the confines of the aquarium, it is best to keep either a solitary specimen or else a group comprising of a single male and at least 8 females. Unfortunately, smaller groups will result in squabbles, where the weakest fish is likely to be picked on and prevented from feeding, eventually succumbing to being bullied by the others. These large shoals should only be considered if the tank is of XXL proportions "if the tank is of average size, it really is best to house a single specimen only. YellowbackAnthias are relatively peaceable. They should not be housed with direct food competitors or with docile species such as firefish. Conversely, ensure that their tankmates are not overly large, belligerent species either, or the Yellowback Anthias will feel intimidated. Many have found that these fish do best when introduced into a tank that already contains a well-established shoal of less-aggressive anthias species, as this helps to stimulate the feeding response and facilitates their own acclimatization. Yellowback Anthias are usually perfectly safe in a mature reef setup, typically swimming out and about in the open water areas and ignoring sessile invertebrates. A varied diet is a must to keep the fish in good health and for them to display their vibrant colouration. Ideally, they will be fed small amounts several times per day (see below). An attached refugium cultivating copepods and amphipods can also really help to provide a steady, ongoing supply of nutritious live food to keep this active planktivore content. Powerful filtration and protein skimming, plus a good maintenance regime are essential for maintaining optimal water quality despite the heavy nutrient input.

Unfortunately, this fish is not recommended for reef aquaria, as although small fish are rarely taken, ornamental invertebrates will be eaten without exception, and corals which are not securely attached to the rockwork may be accidentally toppled. The Zebra Eel grows large and is a voracious eater, so ensure that the filtration/protein skimming is very efficient, with areas of brisk water movement and some calmer resting spots out of the current. This fish is relatively mild-mannered and reclusive, but it can become more pugnacious at feeding times. Conspecifics are not well tolerated, so it is best to maintain just one Zebra Eel per tank. Companions can include many medium-large sized fish that thrive in a fish-only set up. Ensure that the aquarium has tight fitting coverslides and no gaps where equipment feeds into the tank, as these fish are proficient escape artists. Whilst most moray eels are poorly suited to life in the home aquarium, the Zebra Eel is an excellent candidate for those willing to set-up a tank around its specific needs. May also be seen on sale as the Zebra Moray Eel.

Feeding

Offer a variety of meaty foods including Mysis shrimp, krill, prawns, cockle, mussel, clam meat, crab meat, crayfish tails etc.

Breeding

This species has been known to spawn in captivity, but has not been raised successfully to adulthood due to the long, planktonic stage the larvae undergo. It is also difficult to obtain a compatible pair of adults that will cohabit in the same aquarium without issue.`,feeding:`Care

The Zebra Moray Eel is a nocturnal species that is known from wave-swept seaward reefs. Here, this elongate bottom-dweller may be found in the narrow nooks and crannies between rocks and corals, at a maximum depth of 50m (164ft). It typically feeds overnight, with xanthid crabs making up the bulk of the diet, but will also take other crustaceans, molluscs, and urchins. Close-set, pebble-like teeth enable these eels to crush hard-shelled prey with ease. The aquarium should be spacious and mature, with a soft sandy substrate.

As adults, these shoaling fish gather in numbers to feed on the abundance of zooplankton that the currents deliver. Hemitaurichthys is an often overlooked genus, containing 4 known species. It is a shame that they are not seen more often in the trade, as these are relatively hardy fish that acclimatize well to aquarium life, and if well fed, they usually pose no problems in reef aquaria that house some of the more noxious soft corals. A number of aquarists have even found them to be completely reef-safe, but as with such matters, "your mileage may vary", and we would recommend exercising caution and careful observation. Zoster Butterflyfish grow reasonably large and are an active species, so a spacious aquarium that allows room for both ample live rock and a decent swimming space along the front of the tank is requisite. Ideally, these peaceful species will be maintained in small groups, as it prefer to live in aggregations - intraspecific aggression should not be an issue here. It is best to try and obtain medium-sized specimens of between 7.5 and 12.5cm in length,as these always adapt to aquarium life much more readily than those that are very small or very large. If planning on adding a group (and this is best for their long-term well-being), try to obtain specimens that are all of roughly equal sizes, and add all to the tank simultaneously. They should be the only butterflyfish species in the aquarium, and if at all possible, tankmates should be of similar size and temperament. Any fish that could be considered as mildly aggressive should be added after the Zoster Butterflyfish have established their territories, and only if the tank offers sufficient space and ample visual barriers amongst the rockwork. Never try to house these fish with boisterous feeders as they are likely to intimidate the butterflies at feeding time. Ensure that the water is thoroughly filtered and well-oxygenated, and provide areas of brisk current. As with all butterflyfishes, they are always going to be much less likely to pick on coral sand other invertebrates if they are well fed and given plenty of space and distractions. This species is also known as the Black Pyramid Butterflyfish or Brown & White Butterflyfish. The intensity of the brown-black areas on this fish can vary depending on the mood, time of day etc. It is replaced by the yellow and white Pyramid Butterflyfish (H.polylepsis) at Christmas and Cocos-Keeling Islands.',feeding:"Offer a variety of tiny and small frozen foods, in small amounts several times per day e.g. plankton, baby brine shrimp (Artemia nauplii),vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, Mysis shrimp, Angel & Butterfly Mix, and finely chopped krill.
