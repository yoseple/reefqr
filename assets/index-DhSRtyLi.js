However, this attractive, sought-after fish is one of the more demanding members of the Acanthurus genus and is suitable for advanced aquarists only. The aquarium must be spacious, mature, have a vigorous water flow, and contain plenty of live rock which the Achilles Tang will enjoy grazing upon. Include plenty of hiding places that are large enough for your fish to retreat into quickly should it feel threatened, at the same time aiming for an aquascape that allows plenty of open swimming space along the front of the aquarium for such a powerful swimmer. Achilles Tangs are not usually overly aggressive towards tankmates (although rogue specimens have been known), however they will show much hostility towards their own kind and towards other tangs - particularly other members of the Acanthurus genus - so for this reason it is best to house just one specimen per tank and not with any other tangs. It is recommended that the Achilles Tang is the last addition to a set up, as it can be a little territorial to newcomers, especially similar fish species. It is best to source a medium sized specimen (i.e. over 4" in length) as they are more likely to acclimatise well to life in captivity. Conversely, extra large specimens may have a difficult time settling in, so aim for a healthy-looking fish that is neither too small nor excessively large. Avoid any specimens that appear "pinched" in the belly area, and do ask your retailer to show you that your chosen fish is feeding well prior to purchase. Achilles Tangs have a high metabolism and require small frequent feeds throughout the day. Powerful filtration/circulation and a high level of oxygenation are therefore essential for this energetic, voracious eater. Be sure to keep on top of water quality as this fish will not tolerate deteriorating water conditions. A large refugium with living rock can be most useful: macroalgae can be cultured on this rock and these pieces rotated with pieces from the main tank, so that the Achilles Tang has a continual supply of natural foodstuffs to graze upon. Take care when handling this species, as the caudal spines are large and can inflict a very painful wound. A period of quarantine can be a valuable procedure for the acclimatisation of all livestock, and it is of particular importance for the Achilles Tang which can be fairly susceptible to developing marine whitespot. This can be difficult to treat in the reef aquarium. Ideally the fish should be quarantined and carefully observed in a separate aquarium for at least a fortnight before being introduced into your main display tank. May also be seen on sale as the Red Tail Tang. Juvenile fish display an orange caudal peduncle spine; the large orange teardrop marking in this area appearing as the fish mature. In the wild, the Achilles Tang has been known to hybridise with the Gold Rim Tang (A. nigricans). ***Prior to purchase, please bear in mind that the Achilles Tang is a very demanding species that requires an aquarium planned around its well-being; the tang should be made the centrepiece of the tank, with all the other variables worked around to suit its specific needs.

Juvenile African Blennies tend to gather in small groups, whereas the adults are solitary or seen in pairs. Meiacanthus species tend to be quite inoffensive, but they do possess two venomous canine-like teeth in the lower jaw that can be employed should they be attacked. Most fish know to leave them alone, but if they are ingested, a quick, sharp bite on the inside of the predator"™s mouth from the blenny ensures that it is spat out again "“ and it is usually none the worse for wear. These fish do not employ their weaponry in an active manner, instead they use it only as a last resort to defend themselves or their territory. Whilst African Blennies can sometimes be a little secretive, they are generally far more self-assured than other blenniids (most likely due to the possession of such potent defensive apparatus) and will often be seen hovering about in the water column above the rockwork in an inquisitive manner. Provide the African Blenny with a mature tank that contains an abundance of live rock, so that it may continually graze upon it for small crustaceans; without such quantity of well-established rockwork, these fish will not fare very well. It is best to keep just one specimen per tank, unless you can acquire a known mated pair, as these fish can be a little territorial in the confines of the average aquarium. Will cohabit with most species, except for close relatives and much larger carnivorous fish. Ensure that the tank has tight fitting coverslides as these fish are expert jumpers. Please be aware that whilst the bites of Fang Blennies are not usually dangerous to most people, they can be very painful.

The tank must be well established, and of a good size; algae blennies have been known to starve in smaller quarters once the main food source has been depleted and not had time to re-establish. When algae blennies feed, skip over rocks, graze decor and generally go about their business, they tend to stir up detritus where it goes into suspension and is then removed by the filtration. As this species requires a mature tank, it works out well that this should be amongst the last fish added to the tank, preferably at a size around 5cm, where it should not be over-dominant. Algae blennies can be fairly feisty and quite territorial over their favoured parts of the aquarium, particularly as they mature; therefore it is best to keep only one per tank, and careful consideration should be given to tankmates - avoiding other blennies unless you are blessed with a tank of vast proportions incorporating a huge number of visual barriers amongst the rockwork, and more than enough food to go round on a continual basis. It should be noted that algae blennies will not feed on every kind of algae - they particularly relish the filamentous type, but will ignore bubble and slime algae.

Do not keep with other members of the same genus. Will prey on ornamental shrimps, small/docile fish, fanworms, and bristleworms of all sizes (even those much larger than itself). The Arabian Dottyback should be the last fish added to the aquarium, otherwise it will show much aggression towards any newcomers introduced into what it perceives as its established domain. It is essential that the tank has tight fitting coverslides, as these fish are expert jumpers. Tank bred specimens are often available in the trade.

The male entices the female into spawning by performing an elaborate mating dance outside his chosen cave. If the female accepts the male, she will enter the cave and deposit several hundred eggs, which are simultaneously fertilised by the male. The male then drives the female away and takes on paternal care of the adhesive eggs, gently fanning them with his pectoral fins and even picking them up and moving them to a new location if he feels they are in danger. The eggs should hatch within 3-6 days (temperature dependent) and they remain in a larval state for around 30 days. As soon as the eggs hatch, parental care ceases, so you will need to separate the young from the parents and any other fish in the tank just prior to this event. Raising the larvae to adult fish is possible, but very challenging - you will need a ready supply of miniscule foodstuffs such as rotifers available at all times and water quality/tank hygiene must be continually monitored. The female fish can come off a bit the worse for wear following a spawning event (ripped fins, missing scales etc) so be sure to keep a close eye on water quality to ensure she recovers quickly.",id:6},{name:"Asfur Angelfish",link:"https://www.fishkeeper.co.uk/fish/marine/angelfish-dwarf-angelfish/asfur-angelfish",overview:{Synonyms:"Arusetta asfeur, Chaetodon asfur",Distribution:"Western Indian Ocean: Red Sea & Gulf of Aden, south to Zanzibar.",MaximumSize:'40cm (15.8")',Temperature:"Tropical: 23-27°C",WaterParameters:"SG: 1.020-1.025, pH: 8.1-8.4",Compatibility:"Reef with caution; Fish only with live rock",Lighting:"No special requirements","Reef Aquarium Compatibility":"Will nip at LPS corals, certain soft corals (e.g. Xenia), clam mantles, and small ornamental shrimp.

Here these impressive, semi-aggressive fish are found singly or in male-female pairs, feeding primarily on tunicates and sponges. Although the Asfur Angelfish is a large-growing and active species, it can be somewhat shy at times. The aquarium must be voluminous, mature, and contain plenty of live rockwork that is arranged to create a multitude of visual barriers and bolt holes, as well as a roomy swimming space along the front of the tank. In fact the more places to hide, the more you will see of your Asfur Angel; this is because the fish will gain confidence in knowing it can retreat out of sight quickly should it feel the need. Keep only one specimen per tank, and not with any other angelfish. The Asfur Angelfish is considered one of the more peaceful Pomacanthids, and it does best with similar tempered tankmates, although may harass very passive fish or newly introduced fish - for this reason, it should be the final addition to the tank. Unfortunately, Asfur Angels will nip at LPS corals, some soft corals such as Xenia sp., and also clam mantles. However, most SPS corals and some of the more noxious soft corals are usually ignored, particularly if the fish is kept well fed. Filtration should be oversized, with highly efficient protein skimming and powerful circulation. As with many large angelfish species, the juvenile pattern is entirely different to that of the adult fish. Juveniles are a royal blue colour with pale blue and white lightly curved vertical stripes; whereas adults are a dark blue-grey/black with a dazzling yellow crescent shaped sash on each flank, along with a vivid yellow tail. As the fish mature, the tips of the dorsal and anal fin elongate into streamers that trail behind the fish as it swims. The body colour and pattern of adults are similar to that of the Halfmoon/Yellowbar/Red Sea Angelfish (P. maculosus), but they are told apart by the Asfur Angelfish sporting a bright yellow tail (vs. white/colourless in P. maculosus).

This striking angelfish - with its pearly white body and bold black bar running across the upper side from the front of the eye to the posterior of the dorsal fin, and a similar broad black band running sub-marginally on the caudal and anal fins - is rarely seen in the trade, and as such, tends to command a hefty price tag when it is available. This is a challenging fish to keep in the home aquarium because of its specialised feeding requirements, and an ongoing source of frozen sponge-based Angelfish rations is requisite in its long term care. Bandit Angelfish will always fare best in spacious, mature aquaria with an abundance of live rock and an open swimming space along the front of the tank. Established systems will provide much more in the way of nutritious micro-invertebrates in the living rock and this will help to supplement the specialised diet. In smaller systems, such critters will be quickly depleted, which is why it is doubly important that this active fish is given ample space. Bandit Angelfish demand excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of decent current. Keep only one per tank, and not with any other angelfish. If you have your heart set on one of these beautiful fish and can meet all its requirements, it is best to try and acquire a smaller specimen as these have the best record of acclimatising well to the home aquarium.

These graceful, nocturnal fish are typically found dwelling amongst silty seagrass beds, sea anemones, mangrove roots, and coral ledges by day. Youngsters in particular are closely associated with the long-spined sea urchin Diadema setosum, where they will retreat amongst its spines for protection when threatened. At night, these fish feed on small benthic and planktonic crustaceans, in groups that sometimes number up to 200 specimens. In the home aquarium, it is important to provide a spacious reef setting with plenty of shady overhangs, nooks, and crannies. Just as essential is maintaining Banggai Cardinalfish in good sized groups (8+) due to their gregarious nature. Try to obtain fish that are the same size and add all simultaneously. Occasional minor scuffles may occur - usually consisting of chasing, nudging, and fin-flicking - but no real harm should ensue providing there is sufficient space and plenty of visual barriers amongst the decor. However, problems will arise if the group is too small and if the tank lacks space. In smaller set ups, it is best to house a known male-female pair only. Although tank bred specimens are considered relatively hardy, water quality should not be neglected; good filtration is a must and brisk water movement will be much appreciated. Tankmates can include other small, peaceful fish, even other cardinalfish species. Do avoid anything large and boisterous as cardinalfish are easily intimidated and may refuse to come out and feed. Also, be aware that although Banggai Cardinalfish are very placid, they are actually micropredators; therefore small shrimp and very tiny fish may be viewed as food items by larger specimens. Wild Banggai Cardinalfish are currently listed as "Endangered" on the IUCN redlist of threatened species. Thankfully, however, their readiness to reproduce in the aquarium has enabled breeding for the aquatics trade on a large scale. It is important that we, as conscientious aquarists, act responsibly and source captive bred Banggai Cardinalfish wherever possible, to help safeguard the very limited wild population.',feeding:"Offer a variety of meaty items such as Mysis shrimp, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, finely chopped krill/cockle/clam meat etc. Feed small amounts 3 times per day, with at least one of the feeds after lights out.",breeding:"These fish breed readily in the home aquarium. When ready to spawn, courtship behaviour - usually initiated by the female - which consists of the pair swimming alongside each other nudging/trembling near the vent area, and the darkening of the males lower jaw, will take place for quite some time prior to the female releasing her eggs in close proximity to the male, near the bottom of the tank. The male fertilises the eggs (usually numbering up to 60) very quickly and immediately takes them up into his mouth for incubation. The eggs are quite large, at approximately 2.5mm in diameter and will make the males mouth appear a little distended. It is not uncommon for the female to aggressively protect the male when he is mouthbrooding. This is another reason why it is important to give these fish adequate space. The eggs/young will remain within the mouth of the male fish for some time; indeed, the eggs usually take around 20 days to hatch (temperature dependent) and after a further 10 days, when the young are more developed and grown to approx 6-7mm, they are released. During this month-long period, the male fish will not eat and attends to the brood by regularly turning them in his mouth and expelling any that have died.

The aquarium should be mature and should offer plenty of live rock for both grazing opportunities and sanctuary, as well as ample swimming space. There should be good filtration and areas of brisk water movement. The Big Longnose Butterflyfish should be kept singly as it will show much aggression towards its own kind and other butterflyfish species (the only exception to this rule is if a true mated pair can be obtained). It is best housed with other peaceful tankmates so that it does not feel intimidated when feeding.

Here they may be found forming loose aggregations in the mid to upper reaches of steep drop offs, feeding on zooplankton and various marine plants and algae. Juvenile fish are mostly grey with a few bright blue spots distributed over the flanks and tail, along with blue lips. Adults are very imposing fish - they develop a convexly rounded, prominent snout (this being much less of a 'horn' than is seen in the majority of unicornfish), vertical blue lines that break up into small blue spots dorsally, in addition to a broad blue band extending from underneath the eye to the front of the rostral protuberance, and long flowing caudal streamers. Interestingly, these fish have the ability to show or hide their vivid blue markings, depending on mood. The Bignose Unicornfish is a very active, semi-aggressive acanthurid that requires a great deal of swimming space. Adults have been known to grow to almost two feet long, including the long flowing tail filaments. If you are blessed with a system of enormous proportions, the Bignose Unicornfish could make a wonderful centrepiece. The tank should contain plenty of live rock which this fish will enjoy grazing upon. Include plenty of hiding places that are large enough for the Bignose Unicornfish to retreat into quickly should it feel threatened, at the same time aiming for an aquascape that allows plenty of open swimming space along the front of the aquarium for such a powerful swimmer. Bignose Unicornfish are moderately aggressive towards tankmates, especially their own kind; for this reason it is best to house just one specimen per tank. There are good reports of this fish mixing with tangs of other genera; however it is recommended that the Bignose Unicornfish is the last addition to a set up, as it can be rather territorial to newcomers, especially similar fish species. It is best to source a medium sized specimen (i.e. over 4" in length) as they are more likely to acclimatise well to life in captivity. Conversely, extra large specimens may have a difficult time settling in, so aim for a healthy-looking fish that is neither too small nor excessively large. Avoid any specimens that appear "pinched" in the belly area, and do ask your retailer to show you that your chosen fish is feeding well prior to purchase. Bignose Unicornfish have a high metabolism and require small frequent feeds throughout the day. Powerful filtration/vigorous circulation and a high level of oxygenation are therefore essential for this energetic, voracious eater. Be sure to keep on top of water quality as this fish will not tolerate deteriorating water conditions. A large refugium with living rock can be most useful: macroalgae can be cultured on this rock and these pieces rotated with pieces from the main tank, so that the Bignose Unicornfish has a continual supply of natural foodstuffs to graze upon. Take care when handling Bignose Unicornfish, as their caudal spines (2 on each side of the caudal peduncle) are particularly large and can inflict very painful wounds. A period of quarantine can be a valuable procedure for the acclimatisation of all livestock, and it is of particular importance for the Bignose Unicornfish which can be fairly susceptible to developing marine whitespot. This can be difficult to treat in the reef aquarium. Ideally the fish should be quarantined and carefully observed in a separate aquarium for at least a fortnight before being introduced into your main display tank.

Here this unusual-looking 'beaked' wrasse feeds on small benthic crustaceans, brittle stars, molluscs, and small fishes. The Birdmouth Wrasse is hardy and easy to keep, but a spacious aquarium is a necessity, as they are active, grow large, and are powerful (albeit rather jerky) swimmers. Ideally, there will also be ample rockwork to provide plenty of nooks and crannies to explore, plus an open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. A deep substrate is not required, as this species does not bury in the substrate after dark. Provide clean, well oxygenated water with areas of fast current. Tight fitting coverslides are also essential, as these fish are expert jumpers. This is a fairly boisterous wrasse that should only be kept alongside fish of similar size and temperament; smaller fish will be shown much aggression and are likely to be eaten. In the wild, the Birdmouth Wrasse snatches smaller fish in its beak and bashes them against the substrate until it breaks up into bite sized pieces. Tankmates must, therefore, be chosen with much caution. Keep only one male per tank, and, if a pair is desired, add the female and male simultaneously, or else add the female first. If two or more females are introduced to the tank (simultaneously) with no males present, one of the females will begin to change into a male. The aquarium must be of XXL proportions if such a group is to be kept successfully. Whilst the adults of this species can be readily recognised by the characteristic beak-like snout, juveniles may be more difficult to identify, as they do not develop the elongated nose until they are more mature. Like other wrasses, this species is a protogynous sequential hermaphrodite, which means that all fish are born as females and are able to change sex to male, but not back again. The largest fish in a group will be a dominant male, while the smaller fish remain female. If the dominant male dies, the largest female changes sex and takes his place. Male fish can be identified by their vivid emerald green colouration and larger size, compared to the muted browns of the female fish. The Birdmouth Wrasse (G. varius) is sometimes confused with its close relative G. caeruleus, but can be told apart by its slightly different colour pattern and geographical range; however, some experts believe the two are in fact the same species, just with geographical colour differences, but further research is needed. Interestingly, two natural hybrids have been documented.

Here these striking fish are encountered at coral-rich and algae-covered sheltered inner reefs/lagoons, and occasionally estuaries, to depths of 20m (66ft). Juvenile fish tend to prefer the sanctuary of protected inner reef areas, whereas the adults are habitually observed singly or in pairs (and very occasionally in large aggregations) out on the reef, feeding on algae, coral polyps, and small benthic invertebrates. This species is seldom seen in the trade and is regarded as moderately difficult to keep in the home aquarium. It is therefore recommended for advanced aquarists only. A good-sized, mature system is requisite, along with ample live rock for the fish to browse upon/hide amongst and a large open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Medium sized specimens tend to acclimatise better to aquarium life, adapting much more quickly to various prepared foods, so try to choose a healthy, alert specimen around 10cm (3.9") in length. Smaller fish may be very reluctant to feed, and larger specimens can be incredibly finicky, requiring faultless water conditions and an abundance of live food. An aquarium that has some areas of lush filamentous algae growth will also aid your new fish in settling into its new surroundings; however, as with other butterflyfish species, these fish demand excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of brisk current. Some aquarists have successfully kept the Black Butterflyfish alongside some of the more noxious soft corals, but this is something of a risk, and they should be observed carefully. Most corals and motile invertebrates will be constantly nipped at, so unfortunately are best avoided. Keep only one Black Butterflyfish per tank (unless a mated pair is acquired) and not with any other butterflyfish as they will squabble over territories. Whilst they can be rather shy when first introduced, providing them with ample retreats amongst the live rock should ensure they eventually gain confidence and venture out into the open much more.

Here they may be observed in pairs or small, loose aggregations, swimming close to the substrate, whilst browsing for gastropods and foraminiferans. When approached, they move up and down in an unusual way to confuse possible predators. This leopard wrasse requires a very mature, spacious aquarium with plenty of live rock and sand that supports its natural diet on an ongoing basis, if it is to thrive. If added to a newly set up tank, it will starve to death. There should be plenty of hiding places amongst the rockwork, with enough depth of substrate (7.5cm/3" of fine sand) for the fish to bury if it feels threatened. Because of the difficulties in feeding this leopard wrasse, it should not be kept with fish that require a similar food source to survive, as otherwise one species may out-compete the other. There should be relatively calm areas in the tank that allow it to locate food successfully. Tankmates should be peaceful and of an easygoing nature so that the Black Leopard Wrasse does not feel harassed and subsequently stops venturing out to feed. Groups can sometimes be kept together successfully (added simultaneously) but larger numbers should only ever be considered for exceptionally large aquaria, as in the average sized aquarium, natural prey will deplete too quickly with that many fish requiring the same diet. Do not house with other Macropharyngodon species or pugnacious dottybacks and hawkfish, as they will fight for territory. When choosing your leopard wrasse, check that its body is not emaciated, and that it is actively searching for food.

Hardy and relatively peaceful, Blackspot Hogfish make a fascinating addition to reef aquaria where no ornamental shrimp are present. The tank should be mature and furnished with plenty of living rock to provide feeding opportunities and shady hiding places. Juveniles do best if housed with nonaggressive tankmates, but as this species matures, it will become more boisterous and may bully smaller, more docile fish such as firefish, flasher wrasses, leopard wrasses, pipefishes, and seahorses, so choose tankmates with care.

Blonde Lipstick Tangs are not overly aggressive towards tankmates, except their own kind; for this reason it is best to house just one specimen per tank. There are good reports of this fish mixing with tangs of other genera; however it is recommended that the Blonde Lipstick Tang is the last addition to a set up, as it can be a little territorial to newcomers, especially similar fish species. It is best to source a medium sized specimen (i.e. over 4" in length) as they are more likely to acclimatise well to life in captivity. Conversely, extra large specimens may have a difficult time settling in, so aim for a healthy-looking fish that is neither too small nor excessively large. Avoid any specimens that appear "pinched" in the belly area, and do ask your retailer to show you that your chosen fish is feeding well prior to purchase. Blonde Lipstick Tangs have a high metabolism and require small frequent feeds throughout the day. Powerful filtration/circulation and a high level of oxygenation are therefore essential for this energetic, voracious eater. Be sure to keep on top of water quality as this fish will not tolerate deteriorating water conditions. A large refugium with living rock can be most useful: macroalgae can be cultured on this rock and these pieces rotated with pieces from the main tank, so that the Blonde Lipstick Tang has a continual supply of natural foodstuffs to graze upon. Take care when handling Blonde Lipstick Tangs, as their caudal spines are particularly large and can inflict a very painful wound. A period of quarantine can be a valuable procedure for the acclimatisation of all livestock, and it is of particular importance for the Blonde Lipstick Tang which can be fairly susceptible to developing marine whitespot.

Blue Neon Gobies are regularly observed servicing fish that have ectoparasites, helping to control diseases such as Lymphocystis and marine white spot. An advantage over most other cleaner fishes is that the Blue Neon Goby is not an "obligate cleaner" (i.e.it does not rely on cleaning/eating parasites for optimal health).

Blue Spotted Jawfish make a fascinating addition to mature reef aquaria, providing that a few key requirements (including the aforementioned low water temperature) are met. These industrious bottom dwellers need a mixed substrate that is at least 10cm (3.9") deep. Ideally this will be comprised of 75% coral sand, and 25% small pieces of reef rubble (varying from approx. 0.5cm to 1.5cm in diameter). This will allow to the fish to construct a burrow, in which it will spend much time resting just inside the entrance, seemingly watching the world go by and waiting for food morsels to drift past overhead. At other times it will be busy rearranging things in and around its little tunnel, which can be very entertaining to observe. At night they sometimes close the entrance of the burrow with a larger pebble as they reverse in. The aquarium must have a tight fitting cover, as these fish will jump, and lighting should always be turned on gradually so as not to startle your fish. Their constant excavation and digging means that powerful filtration and water movement is prerequisite. Blue Spotted Jawfish may be kept in small groups if you have a vast set-up; in fact they often do better this way, but do ensure that there is adequate space for them all to construct their homes (in the wild they may live as close as 90cm to one another). Ideally all will be introduced at the same time to eliminate any territorial issues.

Juveniles can be kept together in groups very successfully, however, as the fish mature, they often become a little territorial with their own kind and may require their own aquaria. Having said this, Blue Whiptails are generally very peaceful towards other fish that are large enough not to be considered a snack, and tankmates should be of similar size and temperament. The tank should have tight fitting coverslides as these fish are expert jumpers.

Juveniles tend to settle in very shallow inshore crevices with abundant algae growth, whereas the adults swim further into the open waters above the reef, feeding on sponges, tunicates, and other encrusting organisms. This angelfish is a large-growing, active species and requires a voluminous aquarium. Due to its territorial nature, it will need to be provided with plenty of live rockwork that has a multitude of visual barriers and bolt holes, as well as a roomy swimming space along the front of the tank. Keep only one specimen per tank, and not with any other angelfish. Tankmates should be equally large and belligerent - this species should never be kept with invertebrates or small, passive fish. The aquarium should be well filtered, as these fish are voracious eaters, and do provide areas of brisk current with a good level of oxygenation. In the wild, Blueface Angelfish feed on many sessile invertebrates, including sponges, tunicates, stony corals, and soft corals, so unfortunately it is not suitable for reef aquaria. We recommend that the Blueface Angelfish is the last addition to an aquarium, as otherwise it can behave somewhat pugnaciously when introducing new tankmates into what it perceives as its established domain. It is best to choose a healthy individual that is under 20cm (8"), as it will acclimatise to the aquarium much more easily; avoiding any specimens which seem disorientated or uninterested in food or their surroundings. Juvenile fish look very different to the adults: young fish display a pattern of mildly curved vertical stripes, alternating black, white, and blue. Once the fish reaches 12.5cm (5") or so, the pattern will begin to change into the adult form of lemon yellow body colour with blue scales and bright yellow pectoral fins. The face becomes mottled with bright blue (hence the common name) with a striking yellow mask over the eyes. A distinct ocellus also forms at the posterior of the dorsal fin, just above the caudal peduncle.

Ideally, there will also be plenty of rockwork and a sand substrate that is 3-4" deep, to provide resting places for your wrasse. Provide clean, well-oxygenated water with areas of fast current. This is a fairly boisterous species that should only be kept alongside fish of similar size and temperament. Blueheaded Wrasses are protogynous sequential hermaphrodites and there are three primary phases, their colour and size depending on whether they are terminal phase (TP) males, initial phase (IP) males, or females. TP males are also known as "supermales" and have blue heads and green bodies. Three vertical stripes (black, white, black) divide the colours of the head and body, and these fish are generally of a large size. IP males and females are much smaller and have two colour forms. One type, known from reef areas, has a yellow upper half of the body with a slight greeny-black area and a white lower half; the other type, from inshore non-reef regions, is white both above and below the dark area. A dark spot is found on the anterior dorsal fin of both types of IP males and females. IP males and females have the ability to change into TP males and this switch includes a dramatic change of size and coloration. Once transformed from IP male or female to TP male, the change is permanent. It should be noted that in the aquarium, TP males are particularly territorial. Well-fed specimens should not harm corals, but they will prey on shrimps, snails, serpent stars, bristleworms, and small fish.

Juvenile fish tend to stay inshore close to small rubbly outcrops, whereas adults tend to frequent deeper reefs and shipwrecks, where they may be observed feeding on corals, crustaceans, dead fish, molluscs, sea urchins, and tunicates. These fish are best suited to a boisterous fish-only set-up. It is not unusual for these fish to attain over 18", so the aquarium must be especially spacious (wide as well as long, to allow the fish a good turning circle). This will also enable you to aquascape the tank with a good quantity of live rock which will provide refuges for the triggerfish when resting or if startled, whilst still being able to maintain a decent amount of open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Ensure that all decor is secure as these fish are more than capable of rearranging things to their liking. Also be aware that triggerfish are notorious for biting through tubing, and even heaters, so it is worth thinking very carefully about where you place your equipment. Powerful filtration and vigorous water movement are absolutely essential for the wellbeing of this energetic fish. Due to a very belligerent and highly territorial nature, keep only one specimen per tank, and not with any other Triggerfish species. Smaller fish will end up on the menu, so only choose tankmates of similar size and disposition (i.e. large, boisterous fish that can hold their own). It has been reported that divers tend to stay respectfully clear of this species in the wild due to their fearless, aggressive nature. Juveniles that are under 5cm in length sport a yellowish colouration with dark saddles and numerous wavy lines on the body. As the fish mature, these dark saddles are lost, the flanks become yellow-brown, and the fish become covered in a network of brilliant blue lines which become increasingly interconnected with growth. Although these curious, intelligent triggerfish often become "hand tame" and beg for food whilst making grunting noises, it is not advisable to feed directly from your hands as the fingers could easily be mistaken for a meaty snack. Always keep a close eye on where the fish is when carrying out any maintenance in the tank. As with many of the Balistid species, personalities of these fish can be quite varied.

As with other members of the same genus, this goby forms a symbiotic partnership with an almost blind alpheid shrimp; together they share the safety of a burrow which the shrimp digs/maintains, and the goby keeps watch for predators. Whilst the shrimp is working, it maintains antennal contact with its goby partner posted at the entrance of the shared burrow. If the shrimp detects the quivering motion of the goby"™s caudal fin during an unusual situation, it reacts by immediately withdrawing into the depths of the burrow. The entrance to the shared burrow will be closed at night, and only one entrance is usually open at any one time. The shrimp will only emerge from the burrow whilst it can have tactile contact with the goby. Provided with a reasonable depth of coral sand and a good selection of loose coral rubble pieces that vary in size (not too big to be moved) these gobies can do very well in the home aquarium. The goby will survive without its shrimp partner, but if they can be acquired together, they will make such a fascinating display, captivating the observer for hours on end. Your dealer may be able to acquire the two together, it is certainly worth asking. The Bluespot Goby is a territorial species, and larger specimens will think nothing of attacking other gobies and even smaller, unrelated species such as wrasses and assessors. However, it is much less likely to be antagonistic if housed in spacious aquaria with plenty of visual barriers (although do remember to include large, open expanses of substrate), and where it is one of the last fishes added to the tank. Hostility normally initially takes the form of jaw gaping, fin flaring, and sideways shoving, but if it is allowed to escalate, real damage may ensue if the goby takes a bite at its adversary, so do observe very carefully. It is best to keep only one specimen per tank unless you can acquire a mated male-female pair, as conspecifics will fight.

Juvenile fish frequent protected, shallow reef flats during the summer months, with adults swimming in deeper areas, either as solitary fish or in small aggregations of 3-15 individuals. This is an omnivorous species, feeding mostly on benthic invertebrates, especially polychaete worms, plus stony coral polyps and various algae. This somewhat shy species is regarded as moderately hardy, but is best suited to experienced aquarists. A good-sized, mature system is requisite, along with ample live rock for the fish to browse upon/hide amongst and a large open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Medium sized specimens tend to acclimatise better to aquarium life, adapting much more quickly to various prepared foods, so try to choose a healthy, alert specimen around 7.5cm (3") in length. Smaller sized fish may be very reluctant to feed, and larger specimens can sometimes be rather finicky, requiring faultless water conditions. An aquarium that has some areas of lush filamentous algae growth will also aid your new fish in settling into its new surroundings; however, as with other butterflyfish species, these fish demand excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of brisk current. Some aquarists have successfully kept the Bluestriped Butterflyfish alongside some of the more noxious soft corals, but this is something of a risk, and they should be observed carefully. Stony corals and many other sessile invertebrates will be constantly nipped at, so unfortunately must be avoided. Keep only one Bluestriped Butterflyfish per tank (unless a mated pair is acquired) and not with any other butterflyfish as they will squabble over territories. Whilst they can be rather shy when first introduced, providing them with ample retreats amongst the live rock should ensure they quickly gain confidence and venture out into the open. Tankmates should be of similar size and temperament; it is imperative that boisterous companions are avoided if this fish is to settle in and feed. The colouration and markings of the Bluestriped Butterflyfish are fairly distinctive, with well-settled individuals displaying a vibrant yellow background colour and thin blue stripes running diagonally over the body from the snout. Unusually, there is no 'mask' over the eye, a trait common in most (but not all) butterflyfish. There is a small black spot on the top of the head area, and a larger black blotch just in front of the caudal peduncle, the latter of which is thought to aid in confusing predators.

Juvenile Canary Blennies tend to gather in small groups, whereas the adults are solitary or seen in pairs. Meiacanthus species tend to be quite inoffensive, but they do possess two venomous canine-like teeth in the lower jaw that can be employed should they be attacked. Most fish know to leave them alone, but if they are ingested, a quick, sharp bite on the inside of the predator"™s mouth from the blenny ensures that it is spat out again "“ and it is usually none the worse for wear. These fish do not employ their weaponry in an active manner, instead they use it only as a last resort to defend themselves or their territory. Other fish such as the non-venomous Plagiotremus flavus and juveniles of the Fijian form of Scolopsis bilineatus have evolved to mimic this species in order to afford themselves protection from predators, even though they do not possess the same effective dentition deterrent as the Meiacanthus species. Whilst Canary Blennies can sometimes be a little secretive, they are generally far more self-assured than other blenniids (most likely due to the possession of such potent defensive apparatus) and will often be seen hovering about in the water column above the rockwork in an inquisitive manner. Provide the Canary Blenny with a mature tank that contains an abundance of live rock, so that it may continually graze upon it for small crustaceans; without such quantity of well-established rockwork, these fish will not fare very well. It is best to keep just one specimen per tank, unless you can acquire a known mated pair, as these fish can be a little territorial in the confines of the average aquarium.

This fish belongs to the family Serranidae (the sea basses, groupers, and fairy basslets) and is one of around 30 species of reef basslets currently classified within the Liopropoma genus. Reef basslets are very popular in the hobby due to their relative hardiness, attractiveness, easy-to-feed nature, small adult size (most species), and the fact that they do not pick on sessile invertebrates. The Candy Basslet is highly prized by many aquarists, but despite the intense colouration, this is a retiring species that is often difficult to approach in the wild; therefore it does tend to command a hefty price tag when it is available. Although the Candy Basslet is fairly secretive, it makes a fascinating addition to reef aquaria where no small ornamental crustaceans are present, and often becomes bolder over time. The tank should be mature and furnished with a plethora of live rock to provide feeding opportunities and shady hiding places amongst crevices and caves. As a naturally solitary species, it is best to keep only one per tank, and not with any closely related fish, as despite its general shyness the Candy Basslet will behave aggressively towards them. The sexes cannot be told apart visually, but on occasion, mated pairs can be acquired.

Choat's Leopard Wrasse is known from eastern Australia, Middleton and Elizabeth Reefs, and New Caledonia. Here it is found in channels and seaward reefs, over mixed sand, rubble, and coral areas, to depths of 30m (98ft). It may occur singly, in pairs, or in large aggregations of females, and is usually observed browsing for gastropods and foraminiferans amongst the substratum. This leopard wrasse requires a very mature, spacious aquarium with plenty of live rock and sand that supports its natural diet on an ongoing basis, if it is to thrive. If added to a newly set up tank, it will starve to death. There should be plenty of hiding places amongst the rockwork, with enough depth of substrate (7.5cm/3" of fine sand) for the fish to bury if it feels threatened. Because of the difficulties in feeding this leopard wrasse, it should not be kept with fish that require a similar food source to survive, as otherwise one species may out-compete the other. There should be relatively calm areas in the tank that allow it to locate food successfully. Tankmates should be peaceful and of an easygoing nature so that your Choat's Leopard Wrasse does not feel harassed and subsequently stops venturing out to feed. Groups can sometimes be kept together successfully (added simultaneously) but larger numbers should only ever be considered for exceptionally large aquaria, as in the average sized aquarium, natural prey will deplete too quickly with that many fish requiring the same diet. Do not house with other Macropharyngodon species or pugnacious dottybacks and hawkfish, as they will fight for territory. When choosing your leopard wrasse, check that its body is not emaciated, and that it is actively searching for food. It is not uncommon for a newly added leopard wrasse to hide beneath the substrate whilst it adjusts to its new surroundings and altered circadian rhythm; in such cases it is best to leave them be, they will usually begin to explore within a couple of days. These fish require stable and optimal water conditions at all times, so a good filtration and maintenance regime is a must. Ensure that the aquarium has tight fitting coverslides with no small gaps in the hood, as these fish are expert jumpers. The colouration of juveniles and females are similar: a white body adorned with random vivid orange-red blotches (no two share the exact same pattern) and a black spot on the operculum. This black spot is edged with yellow above, and the black area can change intensity depending on the mood of the fish, sometimes changing to a greenish hue. Juvenile fish also display a small black spot on the first few dorsal fin rays. The fins of juveniles and females are almost transparent with random orange blotches on the anal fin. A terminal male, however, will display alternating horizontal stripes of white and orange along the anal fin. May also be seen on sale as Australian Leopard Wrasse or Red Leopard Wrasse. Not recommended for beginners.`,feeding:"Very challenging to feed. This species will spend many hours searching out micro-invertebrates living in amongst the live rock and substrate.

This particular fish was formerly identified as H. ornatissimus, but is now considered a species in its own right. H. claudia is known from much of the Pacific and parts of the Indian Ocean, from French Polynesia to Australia (including the Cocos/Keeling Islands and Christmas Island) and on towards Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. H. ornatissimus is restricted to the waters around the Hawaiian Islands and Johnston Island. The two other members of this complex are H. cosmetus and H. orientalis; H. cosmetus may be found in the Western Indian Ocean and H. orientalis is a subtropical species known from the North-West Pacific. Various different meristic and morphometric measurements do aid somewhat in identification; and although H. ornatissimus shows no real differences from H. claudia in this respect, the former does attain a significantly larger size and is much more restricted in its distribution area. This article concerns H. claudia, perhaps the most colourful member of the complex. This eyecatching red and jade fish is known from outer barrier reef slopes, up to 35m (115ft) in depth, and is usually solitary. It feeds mainly on hard-shelled prey such as crustaceans, molluscs, and urchins, so it is a species that should be added to the reef tank with quite a bit of caution. Although it should not trouble corals, it will feed on a variety of invertebrates (see Reef Aquarium Compatibility section below). However, it can play a very useful role in helping to keep nuisance flatworms and pyramidellid snails (parasites of tridacnid clams) under control. The tank should be mature and furnished with plenty of living rock to provide feeding opportunities, shady hiding places and visual barriers. There should be a deep sand bed of around 3" (7.5cm) or so, in order that the wrasse may bury itself at night or if startled. Keep either a single specimen, or, if the tank is large enough, a good sized group of 5 or 6 individuals (introduced simultaneously, when young and of the same size). Young Christmas Wrasses rarely cause problems in a community type set-up, but larger adults have been known to pick on small passive fish, such as flasher wrasses, fairy wrasses, and firefish, so these combinations are best avoided.

As they are superb diggers, do ensure that all rockwork is secure and cannot be undermined by their extensive tunnel digging; one way of doing this is to forward plan for these fish and place your rockwork before adding substrate to the tank. Peaceful in nature, Convict Blennies should get on with most other fish in the aquarium, provided that they are not small enough to be regarded as "bite size" and not overly aggressive. Concerning invertebrate compatibility, larger specimens will prey on ornamental shrimp, worms, and crustaceans, and it is wise to place corals off the bottom of the aquarium so that they do not become accidentally buried with sand during the Convict Blenny's digging activity. This burrowing behaviour is fascinating to observe and can be very beneficial in keeping the substrate turned over. Convict Blennies are "scale-less" and as such do not tolerate chemical treatments very well at all. It is best to keep on top of water quality to ensure that these aren't necessary.

As with all damsels other than clownfish, dominant fish become male. Social groupings consist of a single territorial male, one or more females and unsexed juvenile fish. In the aquarium a stable group can be created, ideally by mixing individuals of different sizes that duplicate this natural order, or allowing sufficient space for weaker fish to escape serious harassment until a dominant individual develops. Any new humbugs added should be significantly smaller than established ones, duplicating the recruitment of juveniles from the plankton. Expect the male to defend a spawning site vigorously from all intruders apart from females ready to spawn.
  Their aquarium should be spacious and include plenty of rockwork to break sightlines and create hiding spots; try to aquascape it in such a way as to create several visual barriers as this will help to minimise aggression levels. Although hardy, good filtration is a must and decent water movement will be appreciated. Peaceful tankmates are likely to be killed in all but the largest aquaria.
Dominoes are an active, interesting species to keep but do need to be kept in a stocking scheme that is well thought out beforehand. Removing them from a well-furnished tank will be extremely difficult at a later stage and adding any new fishes can be extremely challenging. It's true to say that many keepers regret adding these long-lived fish to their aquarium as their hobby develops and the frustrations of being unable to add new fish sink in. Sadly, as these fish mature, the colour and pattern becomes somewhat drab, with the white markings much less apparent (sometimes to a point where they can't even be seen) and the black body colour takes on much more of a steely grey appearance with dark scale margins. Mature adults are very deep bodied fish. There are many reports of these bold fish biting the hands of their owners as they carry out maintenance on their tanks. No real harm should ensue, but they might make you jump!`,feeding:"Offer a quality dry staple food to ensure good nutrition.

A sub-adult specimen is pictured above. The juvenile colouration is thought to act as a camouflage against predators, which, coupled with the specialised way in which they swim in the current, ensures they appear more like floating seaweed/vegetation than fish. The Dragon Wrasse is best kept as a single specimen in the confines of the aquarium. As this fish matures, its aggression level heightens and it should only be kept alongside fish of a similar size and temperament. The aquarium should have a deep sand bed between 5-10cm (2-4") which will allow for your Dragon Wrasse to bury at night or if harassed or frightened. Powerful filtration and circulation with a high level of oxygenation are a must for this messy eater, as are tight fitting coverslides on account of its ability to jump.

Ideally, this will be comprised of 75% coral sand, and 25% small pieces of reef rubble (varying from approx. 0.5cm to 1.5cm in diameter). This will allow to the fish to construct a burrow, in which it will spend much time resting just inside the entrance, seemingly watching the world go by and waiting for food morsels to drift past overhead. At other times it will be busy rearranging things in and around its little tunnel, which can be very entertaining to observe. At night they sometimes close the entrance of the burrow with a larger pebble as they reverse in. The aquarium must have a tight-fitting cover, as these fish will jump, and lighting should always be turned on gradually so as not to startle your fish. Their constant excavation and digging means that powerful filtration and water movement is prerequisites.

Juveniles, which are black with numerous longitudinal white streaks, are often encountered in outer reef flats.

Although it should not trouble corals, it will feed on a variety of invertebrates (see Reef Aquarium Compatibility section below). However, it can play a very useful role in helping to keep nuisance flatworms and pyramidellid snails (parasites of tridacnid clams) under control. The tank should be mature and furnished with plenty of living rock to provide feeding opportunities, shady hiding places and visual barriers. There should be a deep sand bed of around 3" (7.5cm) or so, in order that the wrasse may bury itself at night or if startled. Keep either a single specimen, or, if the tank is large enough, a good sized group of 5 or 6 individuals (introduced simultaneously, when young and of the same size).

These fish sometimes occur singly but adults are more commonly seen in pairs that share sandy burrows. These fascinating bottom dwellers are said to mimic crabs as they hop about with their two eyespot-clad dorsal fins held erect and the black pelvic and anal fins appearing like pincers underneath them. Another school of thought suggests that the lateral view of the fish mimics the face of a large, carnivorous fish, which would make much more sense as a defence mechanism. Either way, it only takes a split second for the large ocelli to confuse a predator. Eyespot Gobies are most often observed filter feeding from the fine substrate, sifting out tiny interstitial invertebrates from the sand. They should only ever be added to a well-established reef tank, where there will be plenty of live rock and live substrate that supports their natural diet. This species will spend many hours searching out the miniscule invertebrates living amongst the substrate. It absolutely must be provided with an ongoing source of natural prey and the best way to ensure a continuous supply of tiny live foods is by culturing them in an attached fishless refugium. If added to a newly set up tank, these fish will simply starve to death. There should be plenty of hiding places amongst the rockwork, with enough depth of fine substrate and small rubble pieces or shell fragments for the fish to construct a burrow. Because of the challenges in feeding Eyespot Gobies, they should not be kept with fish that require a similar food source to survive (e.g. Mandarins), as otherwise one species may out-compete the other. There should be relatively calm areas in the tank that allow the gobies to locate food successfully. Tankmates should be peaceful and of an easygoing nature so that the Eyespot Gobies do not feel harassed and subsequently stop venturing out to feed. Avoid housing with ornamental shrimp, as these are likely to become a snack. It is best to keep these fish as a known mated pair as single specimens are known to fare rather poorly in the aquarium. Two males placed together in close quarters will fight, so it is best to ensure that the fish you have are compatible (and not just two fish randomly paired up) and offer them enough space and visual barriers. A spacious tank not only provides them with enough territory, but also, very importantly, offers a much larger sandbed for feeding opportunities.

Ensure that food offered reaches the bottom of the tank, where the gobies will ingest it as they take in mouthfuls of substrate to sift. If food does not reach the bottom of the aquarium on a regular basis due to aggressive feeders in the same tank, the gobies are likely to become malnourished. Offer small amounts of food several times per day, target feeding if necessary. Before purchasing, please be aware that this species must be provided with natural prey (non-live foods rarely sustain them for any great length of time), and a constant supply of tiny foods for this purpose could be cultured in a fishless refugium.

Cheap and extremely hardy, juvenile Humbugs are very attractive and reef-friendly, but grow into extremely aggressive fish that are likely to terrorise their tankmates. As with all damsels other than clownfish, dominant fish become male. Social groupings consist of a single territorial male, one or more females and unsexed juvenile fish. In the aquarium a stable group can be created, ideally by mixing individuals of different sizes that duplicate this natural order, or allowing sufficient space for weaker fish to escape serious harassment until a dominant individual develops. Any new humbugs added should be significantly smaller than established ones, duplicating the recruitment of juveniles from the plankton. Expect the male to defend a spawning site vigorously from all intruders apart from females ready to spawn.
  Their aquarium should be spacious and include plenty of rockwork to break sightlines and create hiding spots; try to aquascape it in such a way as to create several visual barriers as this will help to minimise aggression levels. Although hardy, good filtration is a must and decent water movement will be appreciated. Peaceful tankmates are likely to be killed in all but the largest aquaria.
Humbugs are an active, interesting species to keep but do need to be kept in a stocking scheme that is well thought out beforehand. Removing them from a well-furnished tank will be extremely difficult at a later stage and adding any new fishes can be extremely challenging. It's true to say that many keepers regret adding these long-lived fish to their aquarium as their hobby develops and the frustrations of being unable to add new fish sink in.`,feeding:"Offer a quality dry staple food to ensure good nutrition.

This somewhat shy species is regarded as moderately difficult to keep in the home aquarium, and is therefore recommended for advanced aquarists only. A good-sized, mature system is requisite, along with ample live rock for the fish to browse upon/hide amongst and a large open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Medium sized specimens tend to acclimatise better to aquarium life, adapting much more quickly to various prepared foods, so try to choose a healthy, alert specimen around 9cm (3.5") in length. Smaller sized fish may be very reluctant to feed, and larger specimens can sometimes be rather finicky, requiring faultless water conditions. An aquarium that has some areas of lush filamentous algae growth will also aid your new fish in settling into its new surroundings; however, as with other butterflyfish species, these fish demand excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of brisk current. Some aquarists have successfully kept the Fourspot Butterflyfish alongside some of the more noxious soft corals, but this is something of a risk, and they should be observed carefully. Stony corals and many other sessile invertebrates will be constantly nipped at, so unfortunately must be avoided. Keep only one Fourspot Butterflyfish per tank (unless a mated pair is acquired) and not with any other butterflyfish as they will squabble over territories. Whilst they can be rather shy when first introduced, providing them with ample retreats amongst the live rock should ensure they eventually gain confidence and venture out into the open much more.

Juvenile fish form large aggregations amongst Acropora corals, where they may be observed feeding on algae growing from the dead bases of the corals, whereas the adults are rather more territorial and tend to occur singly or in pairs. This somewhat shy species is a member of the venomous rabbitfish family, and is very similar in appearance to the One-Spot Fox Face (S. unimaculatus) but lacks the large dark spot on the posterior of each flank. You may often see juveniles kept together in large shoals without problems in your local aquatics store, but be aware that as the fish mature, they become intolerant of their own kind within the confines of the aquarium and should be kept singly, with the exception of a bonded male-female pair. Unrelated fish species will be ignored, most giving the Foxface a wide berth because of the venomous spines on their dorsal and anal fins. Needless to say, this is a fish that must be handled with much care when catching and acclimatising; ideally it should be gently herded into a submerged fish-bag or solid container, rather than risk using a net to lift it from the water. The fish is likely to erect its fins, entangling the sturdy spines in the netting, and at the same time there is the chance of the aquarist receiving a very painful sting. The tank itself should offer plenty of dark hiding places amongst rockwork, and employ decent filtration and circulation. If adding this species to a reef aquarium, be aware that occasional specimens do have a taste for coral polyps, particularly those that are hungry, so be sure to observe carefully and ensure the fish is receiving enough food. The Foxface has a small mouth that is specially adapted for browsing on algae (the main constituent of its diet). They must receive regular offerings of greenfoods in their diet, otherwise their colours will fade and their health may suffer. Meaty foods can be offered, and indeed will be accepted, but it is very important that rabbitfish receive a decent amount of algae-based foodstuffs as part of their daily nourishment.

Gold Neon Gobies are regularly observed servicing fish that have ectoparasites, helping to control diseases such as Lymphocystis and marine whitespot. An advantage over most other cleaner fishes is that the Gold Neon Goby is not an "˜obligate cleaner"™ (i.e. it does not rely on cleaning/eating parasites for optimal health). As such, it will do just as well in a healthy aquarium where it is offered quality commercially prepared foodstuffs. This diminutive goby rarely shows aggression towards other species, although it will fight with members of its own kind, especially in smaller aquaria where space and territories are more limited. Large groups (7+) can be kept if the system is spacious; however in smaller aquaria it is advisable to keep either a single specimen or a known mated pair. Although these gobies cannot be sexed externally, it is often fairly easy to pick out a compatible pair at your local aquarium store as they may have paired off and be resting very close to one another. With regards to compatibility, Gold Neon Gobies are ideal for community reef aquaria; they are also often purported to coexist with a number of unlikely large predators, which usually tend to leave the gobies alone on account of their known cleaning services. However, much caution is necessary as all fish vary in personality and temperament and there can be no guarantees when it comes to their safety with such tankmates present. Observe carefully and if in any doubt, do not add them to your aquarium. It is not advisable to add Gold Neon Gobies to an aquarium containing predatory crabs.

As their planktonic prey is swept to them in these areas of brisk water movement, they can be relaxed about resources and enjoy protection from predators amongst the branching coral thickets. This makes them amongst the most peaceful of the notorious damselfish family.
  Being a relatively peaceful social species, Chromis should be kept in groups of 6 or more. These active fish spend a lot of time out in the water column, in turn acting as "dither fish", encouraging more reclusive species out into the open and encouraging other plankton feeders to try a range of prepared diets that more finicky fishes may not recognise as food. Single specimens may pine away in the corners of the tank or become harassed by other tankmates; indeed, keeping this sociable species in this way could be considered cruel. As with any damselfish, groups are most stable when a single larger dominant fish is added alongside smaller specimens - this larger fish will rapidly become a territorial dominant male, even if this means a change of current gender. This mimics the situation seen in nature and stops individuals fighting over the top spot. Multiple males can coexist in large set ups if numbers are high and each has access to a spawning territory.
  Green Chromis are generally peaceful, relatively hardy, and are considered a good beginner's fish. Tankmates should be of a peaceful nature, although larger territorial species such as tangs and angelfish seldom see them as a threat.

These fish are characterised by a green body colour with red to violet stripes, broken lines, or rows of spots on the flanks, 4-5 reddish bars on head, and an absence of scales. The modified ventral fins have fused to form a kind of suction cup that helps them to maintain position on coral branches in swift currents. Green Coral Gobies are generally of a peaceful nature and make a wonderful addition to mature reef aquaria containing established colonies of broad-branching SPS corals, which they very much enjoy hiding amongst. Although often recommended for nano aquaria because of its diminutive size, caution should be exercised for two reasons. Firstly, smaller tanks will limit the number of individuals you can keep together; only one specimen is recommended in small nano type tanks, otherwise there will be constant arguments over territory which could result in the untimely demise of the weaker individual. Secondly, the more space available in a reef setting, the chances are that there will be much larger, stable colonies of suitable SPS corals available, and so it is less likely that these fish will damage any one individual beyond repair as they go about their daily routines (hiding/resting amongst the branches, and feeding on the occasional mucous polyp). If these types of corals are not being cultivated in your aquarium, invest in several coral skeletons so that these fish have something natural to interact with and give them a sense of security.

The aquarium should be aquascaped with plenty of live rock to form numerous hiding places, with an open swimming space left along the front of the tank. Juvenile Harlequin Tuskfish are usually quite shy and will spend a fair bit of time hiding until they gain size and confidence. Unusually for wrasse, these fish do not bury themselves in the substrate, although they tend to rest near the tank bottom at night. Larger specimens, despite the somewhat ferocious appearance (those big blue teeth!), are gentle giants and are actually easily bullied, so choose tankmates with care. Anything bite-sized should also be avoided, as should crustaceans, molluscs, and shrimp (even cleaners). In the wild, adults are solitary and maintain a large territory amongst seaward reefs; for this reason, keep only one per tank as otherwise major territorial issues will arise. Other large wrasse species are also best avoided. Be sure to keep on top of water quality; powerful filtration/circulation and a high level of oxygenation are essential for this voracious eater of high protein foods.

The more places of safety available to these fish, the more you will see them out in the open, as they will learn that they can quickly retreat if necessary. Harrow Cardinalfish are a shoaling species and really should be maintained in small groups of at least 5-7 specimens, introduced simultaneously. Keeping these fish in decent numbers will not only make the fish less nervous, but will also result in a more effective, natural-looking display.

These fish tend to live in pairs and they are often seen hovering together in the water column feeding on zooplankton; however they tend not to stray far from cover.
This species is an ideal candidate for the mature reef aquarium; it is colourful, relatively peaceful, and readily acclimatises to aquarium life. The tank should be aquascaped with plenty of live rock so that there are numerous nooks and crannies for your firefish to dart into if startled; they especially favour piles of loose rubble. There should be areas of brisk water movement and a high level of oxygenation, these fish can often be seen hovering in the water column, facing the strong current whilst waiting for microscopic food morsels to drift past. Helfrich"s Firefish will rarely become aggressive towards other fish species (except close relatives), but it can be very territorial with its own kind, and they will fight fiercely unless they are a mated pair. For this reason it is best to either keep a single specimen (particularly in smaller, "˜nano" aquaria) or acquire a known mated pair. These fish cannot be easily sexed externally and simply putting two specimens together and hoping for the best is unlikely to work, although adding a group to a large aquarium will usually result in harmonious pairing, with 'spare' fish being removed if they become victims of aggression. Tankmates should be of a peaceful nature in order that the firefish do not feel intimidated at feeding times. Observe very carefully, as firefish are easily bullied. Do ensure that the tank has tightly fitting coverslides and absolutely no escape holes, as these fish are expert jumpers. Take care when acclimatising too, as they will jump from the shipping bag if it is not covered.

These herbivorous fish are moderately gregarious and are often observed feeding in small harems. Herald's Angelfish requires a mature aquarium with plenty of live rockwork, on which it can graze for the microalgae, and in which it can hide. This vibrant, golden fish is rather notorious for picking on zoanthids and LPS corals (see Reef Aquarium Compatibility below) so caution is advised when adding to a reef set up; the larger the tank, the better, as the fish is then less likely to continually pick at any particular sessile invertebrate and cause irreparable damage. A frequent, varied feeding regime will also help in this respect.

Unless the aquarium is of XL proportions, only one specimen should be housed per tank, and not with any other Centropyge species. If the aquarium is spacious enough, it is possible to keep a male-female pair, or a small harem of one male and two or three females, if they are all of a fairly young age and are added simultaneously.

Another variant has a black blotch on the posterior of the dorsal and also a black anal fin. Interestingly, these black patches are said to sometimes disappear in the aquarium, rendering the fish a solid golden yellow, akin to the standard form. Dusky coloured variants are also known from Cebu and Vanuatu, and these may have a dusting of black all over, or just confined to one area, such as the head.

Here these fish have been observed forming small aggregations of up to 5 individuals at steep outer reef drop offs and areas of black coral and sea fan growths. This small-sized butterflyfish is one of a complex of several similar looking fish and is only sporadically seen in the aquarium trade. This species is regarded as moderately difficult, and is therefore recommended for advanced aquarists only. A good-sized, mature system is requisite, along with ample live rock for the fish to browse upon/hide amongst and a large open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Water temperature should be lower than average on account of these fish hailing from deeper, slightly cooler waters (typically 22-80m/72-263ft). Medium sized specimens tend to acclimatise better to aquarium life, adapting much more quickly to various prepared foods, so try and choose a healthy, alert specimen around 7cm (2.8") in length. Smaller sized fish may be reluctant to feed, and larger specimens can sometimes be rather finicky, requiring faultless water conditions. An aquarium that has some areas of lush filamentous algae growth will also aid your new fish in settling into its new surroundings; however, as with other butterflyfish species, these fish demand excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of brisk current. Some aquarists have successfully kept the Indian Butterflyfish alongside some of the more noxious soft corals, but this is something of a risk, and they should be observed carefully. Stony corals and many other sessile invertebrates will be constantly nipped at, so unfortunately must be avoided. Keep only one Indian Butterflyfish per tank (unless a mated pair is acquired) and not with any other butterflyfish as they will squabble over territories. Whilst they can be a little shy when first introduced, providing them with ample retreats amongst the live rock will ensure they quickly gain confidence and venture out into the open. Once settled, these intelligent, peaceful fish actually become very assertive feeders, competing with most other fish species, and they will also be most curious of any activity in and around their aquarium. Tankmates should be of similar size and temperament.

Adults are usually found in pairs, feeding near the substrate on various small crustaceans, but some specimens have been found in open water, attached to drifting Sargassum some 20km (12.4miles) from the shore. Most specimens seen in the aquatics trade will have been captive bred, the majority by the Tropical Marine Centre (TMC). This helps to take pressure off of the wild populations, currently listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species and CITES II listed. Interestingly, the common Seahorse has two main colour phases: black and yellow. The black form can be grey to black with a somewhat grainy-looking appearance, and the yellow form may be cream, yellow, or golden, with fairly large dark spots (especially in the females) and a black line running from their chest to their abdomen. The golden phase seahorses are capable of dramatic colour change, depending on their surroundings, mood, or stress, and they may take on an olive appearance when first adjusting to their new home. Other variable colour forms are far less common, but some individuals may show a mixture of black and yellow. Instead of scales, all seahorses have a layer of skin that is stretched over bony plates, visible as a series of rings around the trunk. The eyes can move independently of one another, and locomotion is powered by rapidly oscillating the dorsal fin, whilststeering with the pectorals. In this species, the coronet is typically of a low to medium height and rounded, sometimes with a cup-like depression in the top, and with a noticeable overhang at the back. The skin is not particularly spiny in this species, instead, there are low, rounded bumps, and 11 conspicuous trunk rings (plus 34-38 tail rings). In order for seahorses to thrive in captivity, they are best maintained in mature species-only aquaria, where they will not be subjected to boisterous companions and outcompeted for food. Ideally, the aquarium will provide plenty of stationary branching decor which they can grab onto with their amazing prehensile tails e.g. gorgonian skeletons, plastic plants, orlive marine greenery. As they are masters of camouflage, providing areas of golden-hueddÃ©cor is known to encourage gold phase specimens to take on their most intense colours. Water flow should be gentle so that these poor swimmers are not blown into solid surfaces; gentle current also having the added benefit of increasing their chances of finding plenty of food items. As steady feedings are required,regular partial water changes are essential (be very careful in matching the temperature and salinity of the new water to that which you have taken from the tank). The use of a small protein skimmer can be very beneficial. In addition to the requisite branching decor as mentioned above, a live sand bed plus some live rock will help to culture various prey items such as amphipods and isopods, which the seahorses can browse upon in between the times when the aquarist adds food to the tank. Many find that an adjacent refugium is extremely beneficial in keeping a constant supply of live food available to their seahorses. Before purchase, ensure that the seahorses are in good health and are feeding well (ask the shop to demonstrate). When seahorses are to be taken from an aquarium i.e. when purchasing or if moving them to different quarters, always ensure that they are herded into a suitable container or bag under the water; if they are lifted free from the water, they may well ingest air which can cause them problems. Likewise, many species can all too easily become entangled in nets and then subsequently damaged when trying to free them. The herding under technique really is the kindest method of capture. Please plan your seahorse aquarium carefully and responsibly - the primary lack of success in keeping syngnathids in captivity is starvation, which is so easily avoided. To reiterate: (1) provide a mature, stable, and gentle, "non-competitive" environment with appropriate decor, (2) ensure that there is an ongoing supply of various nutritious foods via very regular feedings, living sand/rock, and a fishless refugium, and (3) choose healthy captive-bred livestock that is provento be feeding well, and is bagged for you without exposure to air.

regularly captive-bred for the trade, taking pressure off the vulnerable wild
populations; it has also been bred in the home aquarium. This species is
monogamous, and prior to breeding, the couple will begin an elaborate courtship
ritual where the male dances around the female, whilst changing colour and
producing clicking sounds. After a time, the pair will entwine their tails and
float together over the substrate. They will then turn belly to belly and the
female will insert her ovipositor into the males brood pouch (which is located
on his belly, under the tail) and lays her eggs. The male then fertilises the
eggs, which subsequently become embedded into the walls of the pouch. The brood
size is quite variable, depending on the age and size of the parents, but will
typically number around 200-300 on average. The courtship ritual will then
continue for some time, even after the male has become pregnant. Some 20-28
days later, the male goes into labour (usually at night), and this can be quite
a strenuous task that involves much thrusting, sometimes over the course of
several hours, until all of the young seahorses are released. There is no
parental care, the pelagic young are fully independent and fend for themselves,
usually attaching themselves to decor or greenery near the surface. They measure
around 7mm/0.28" when born, and can be fed baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) straight away. It may

Juvenile fish (which sport a large, distinctive black ocellus edged in blue on each flank) are very secretive and stay close to the safety of corals and small crevices, whereas adults venture further afield.
The Lemonpeel Angelfish requires a mature aquarium with plenty of rockwork, on which it can graze for the microalgae, and in which it can hide. This vibrantly-coloured fish is rather notorious for picking on zoanthids and LPS corals (see Reef Aquarium Compatibility below) so caution is advised when adding to a reef set up; the larger the tank, the better, as the fish is then less likely to continually pick at any particular sessile invertebrate and cause irreparable damage. A frequent, varied feeding regime will also help in this respect.
Like most other members of the Centropyge genus, the Lemonpeel Angelfish does not grow very large, but nevertheless, it is an active species which requires plenty of space. The least problematic combinations of fish come from mixing them with dissimilar tank mates and combining them with other dwarf angels can be problematic unless certain measures are taken. As they're protogynous, all young individuals are potentially female, and animals of equal size are likely to clash over hierarchy with dominant individuals becoming male. For this reason, it's best to keep them singly or in pairs or groups where a significant size difference makes dominance straightforward with minimal fighting. This also applies when attempting to house different species of Centropyge together and generally speaking, it's always best to add smaller individuals to established ones. This mimics the natural state where young fish settle out the plankton and into existing communities of territorial fishes. The greater the difference in size, the less aggression will be displayed although solitary fish will often be overstimulated if they've been kept alone for an extended period. Ritualised display postures appease aggression in the more dominant fish, but close supervision may be needed and keeping multiple dwarf angels is best attempted in large aquaria with plenty of rockwork. Buying existing pairs or groups is easier, as the stressful first date scenario can be avoided.
Natural hybrids of this fish and the Half-black Angelfish (C. vrolikii) are sometimes available. Interestingly, the Lemonpeel Angelfish is mimicked by juvenile Acanthurus pyroferus tangs, who probably benefit from the large spines below the gill covers that predators know are a feature of dwarf angels.

In the wild, the Leopard Wrasse is found over mixed sand, rubble, and coral areas of sub-tidal reef flats and outer lagoons/seaward reefs to depths of 30m (98ft), where it occurs singly, in pairs, or in large aggregations of females, and is usually observed browsing for gastropods and foraminiferans amongst the substratum. This leopard wrasse requires a very mature, spacious aquarium with plenty of live rock and sand that supports its natural diet on an ongoing basis, if it is to thrive. If added to a newly set up tank, it will starve to death. There should be plenty of hiding places amongst the rockwork, with enough depth of substrate (7.5cm/3" of fine sand) for the fish to bury if it feels threatened. Because of the difficulties in feeding this leopard wrasse, it should not be kept with fish that require a similar food source to survive, as otherwise one species may out-compete the other. There should be relatively calm areas in the tank that allow it to locate food successfully. Tankmates should be peaceful and of an easygoing nature so that the Leopard Wrasse does not feel harassed and subsequently stops venturing out to feed. Groups can sometimes be kept together successfully (added simultaneously) but larger numbers should only ever be considered for exceptionally large aquaria, as in the average sized aquarium, natural prey will deplete too quickly with that many fish requiring the same diet. Do not house with other Macropharyngodon species or pugnacious dottybacks and hawkfish, as they will fight for territory. When choosing your leopard wrasse, check that its body is not emaciated, and that it is actively searching for food.

This is a delicate species that is really only suitable for advanced aquarists with mature, dimly-lit, deepwater tanks. In the confines of the home aquarium, it is best to keep either a solitary specimen, or else a group comprising of a single male and at least 8 females. Unfortunately, smaller groups will result in squabbles, where the weakest fish is likely to be picked on and prevented from feeding, eventually succumbing to being bullied by the others. These large shoals should only be considered if the tank is of XXL proportions " if the tank is of average size, it really is best to house a single specimen only. Longfin Anthias are relatively peaceable and somewhat shy. They should not be housed with direct food competitors or with docile species such as firefish. Conversely, ensure that their tankmates are not overly large, belligerent species either, or the Longfin Anthias will feel intimidated. Longfin Anthias are usually perfectly safe in a mature deep reef set up, typically swimming out and about in the open water areas and ignoring sessile invertebrates. It is essential that illumination is kept subdued if these fish are going to acclimatise successfully though; the bright lighting of a typical shallow-water reef is cited as one of the key reasons for these fish not adjusting well to life in the home aquarium. Provide plenty of shady crevices and overhangs amongst the rockwork, ensuring all structures are stable. Likewise, the temperature of the tank water is also crucial: as these fish inhabit deepwater drop-offs where they are often exposed to an upwelling of colder currents, the aquarium water temperature should not be allowed to rise above 25 °C (77 deg F), so a means of chilling the water may be necessary during hot summer months. A varied diet is a must to keep the fish in good health and for them to display their vibrant colouration. Ideally they will be fed small amounts several times per day (see below). An attached refugium cultivating copepods and amphipods can also really help to provide a steady, ongoing supply of nutritious live food to keep this active planktivore content. Powerful filtration and protein skimming, plus a good maintenance regime are essential for maintaining optimal water quality despite the heavy nutrient input. As these fish inhabit areas of moderate to strong currents in the wild, they require fairly brisk water movement in the home aquarium - a high level of oxygenation at all times being of utmost importance.

Keep only one per tank and not with any other angelfish species, as they will fight. The gill cover spine is a formidable weapon, used both for defence and aggression (take care when netting or handling these fish). Juveniles are particularly reclusive, but adults should become bolder with age. As mentioned previously, the tank should be aquascaped so that it has a decent amount of bolt-holes amongst the decor where the fish can retreat to if necessary. In fact the more places to hide, the more likely you are to see more of your Majestic Angel; this is because the fish will gain confidence in knowing it can retreat out of sight quickly should it feel the need. Do not introduce similarly shaped/coloured fish into the aquarium after your Majestic Angel has become established in the tank, as although not as aggressive as some of the other larger angel species, it will behave very antagonistically towards these newcomers. Unfortunately, Majestic Angels will nip at LPS corals, some soft corals such as Xenia sp., and also clam mantles. However, most SPS corals and some of the more noxious soft corals should be ignored. Filtration should be oversized, with highly efficient protein skimming and powerful circulation. Many experts consider this species to reside in the "Euxiphipops complex" (a sub-genus), along with 2 other species, namely the Bluefaced Angel (P. xanthometopon) and the Sixbanded Angel (P. sexstriatus). The latter two are considered extremely challenging to keep in the home aquarium, and none are suitable for beginners. With such a huge family of fish to choose from, there are many Angelfish species that are much hardier and better suited to captivity than these beauties from the Euxiphipops complex.',feeding:"Offer a varied diet which includes frozen foods containing Spirulina, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, Mysis shrimp, finely chopped shrimp etc, plus marine flake food and greens, including Nori.

If added to a newly set up tank, it will starve to death. There should be plenty of hiding places amongst the rockwork, with enough depth of substrate for the fish to bury if it feels threatened. Never add this bottom dwelling fish to a tank housing anemones, as it could easily end up being consumed. Because of the difficulties in feeding the Mandarin, it should not be kept with fish that require a similar food source to survive, as otherwise one species may out-compete the other. There should be relatively calm areas in the tank that allow the Mandarin to locate food successfully. Tankmates should be peaceful and of an easygoing nature so that the Mandarin does not feel harassed and subsequently stops venturing out to feed.

In the home aquarium, this hardy, eye-catching fish is safe with corals, but does not appreciate the bright lighting that many sessile invertebrates require. If it is to be kept in a reef setting, ensure that there are a multitude of dark caves and crevices amongst the rockwork so that it can take refuge during the day, and preferably some areas of the tank that have more subdued lighting. Tankmates must be chosen with care, as adult Marine Bettas are capable of taking small fish and ornamental shrimps; however, they are a great choice for reef set-ups that contain corals and medium sized peaceful fish only. This fish behaves very shyly, especially when first introduced into the aquarium, but it can be coaxed out a little more if it is given adequate space, areas of subdued lighting/plenty of dark hidey-holes, and peaceful tankmates that are not too boisterous at feeding times. Unless the tank is very spacious, it is best to keep just a single specimen, unless you can acquire a compatible pair. A dim moon light that is run during the evening hours will allow you to view your Marine Betta as it goes about its business under the preferred subdued illumination. Interestingly, this species is a Batesian mimic of the Guineafowl Moray Eel (Gymnothorax meleagris). When threatened, the Marine Betta holds all its unpaired fins erect and swims headfirst into a crevice. Rather than swimming right into the hole, it stops part way in, with the posterior part of its body exposed. The back end of the Marine Betta, with fins held erect, resembles the shape of a moray eel's head. The white spotted pattern and the prominent ocellus on the dorsal fin further add to the illusion that it is a spotted moray eel peering out from a rock, and by appearing to be something dangerous, the 'moray eel' is then given a wide berth by would-be predators.

However, housed in the right setting, the Maroon Clownfish makes a wonderful addition to the marine aquarium. Ensure that they are the last planned addition to the tank, so that they cannot become over-territorial towards newcomers. Each mated pair is reported to inhabit one Bubbletip Anemone (Entacmaea quadricolor) in the wild. Take care when catching/moving this species, as the cheek spines can become tangled in netting very easily. There are two distinct colour morphs, one with the usual white vertical bands, and one which possesses yellow bands (pictured). Some suggest that the yellow striped colour morph (known from Sumatran waters) should be given recognised status as P. epigrammata, a species in its own right. With regards to sexing, all clownfish are born as males. A wild colony may consist of a breeding pair, which cohabit with a few non-reproductive smaller male specimens. When the female dies, the dominant male will change sex and become the female. This is known as protandrous sequential hermaphroditism. May also be seen on sale as Spinecheek Anemonefish.

This small-sized butterflyfish is one of a complex of several similar looking fish and is only sporadically seen in the aquarium trade. This species is regarded as moderately difficult, and is therefore recommended for advanced aquarists only. A good-sized, mature system is requisite, along with ample live rock for the fish to browse upon/hide amongst and a large open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Water temperature should be lower than average on account of these fish hailing from deeper, slightly cooler waters (typically 20-80m/66-263ft). Medium sized specimens tend to acclimatise better to aquarium life, adapting much more quickly to various prepared foods, so try and choose a healthy, alert specimen around 7cm (2.8") in length. Smaller sized fish may be reluctant to feed, and larger specimens can sometimes be rather finicky, requiring faultless water conditions. An aquarium that has some areas of lush filamentous algae growth will also aid your new fish in settling into its new surroundings; however, as with other butterflyfish species, these fish demand excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of brisk current. Some aquarists have successfully kept the Marquesas Butterflyfish alongside some of the more noxious soft corals, but this is something of a risk, and they should be observed carefully. Stony corals and many other sessile invertebrates will be constantly nipped at, so unfortunately must be avoided. Keep only one Marquesas Butterflyfish per tank (unless a mated pair is acquired) and not with any other butterflyfish as they will squabble over territories. Whilst they can be a little shy when first introduced, providing them with ample retreats amongst the live rock will ensure they quickly gain confidence and venture out into the open. Once settled, these intelligent, peaceful fish actually become very assertive feeders, competing with most other fish species, and they will also be most curious of any activity in and around their aquarium. Tankmates should be of similar size and temperament. As mentioned above, C. declivis forms part of a complex of similar-looking, deepwater fish known as the Tinker's Complex, which also includes C. burgessi, C. flavocoronatus, C. mitratus, and C. tinkeri.

Mata Tangs are moderately aggressive towards tankmates, and in the confines of the home aquarium, this includes their own kind; for this reason it is best to house just one specimen per tank. There are good reports of this fish mixing with tangs of other genera; however it is recommended that the Mata Tang is the last addition to a set up, as it can be rather territorial to newcomers, especially similar fish species. It is best to source a medium sized specimen (i.e. over 4" in length) as they are more likely to acclimatise well to life in captivity. Conversely, extra large specimens may have a difficult time settling in, so aim for a healthy-looking fish that is neither too small nor excessively large. Avoid any specimens that appear "pinched" in the belly area, and do ask your retailer to show you that your chosen fish is feeding well prior to purchase. Mata Tangs have a high metabolism and require small frequent feeds throughout the day. Powerful filtration/vigorous circulation and a high level of oxygenation are therefore essential for this energetic, voracious eater. Be sure to keep on top of water quality as this fish will not tolerate deteriorating water conditions. A large refugium with living rock can be most useful: macroalgae can be cultured on this rock and these pieces rotated with pieces from the main tank, so that the Mata Tang has a continual supply of natural foodstuffs to graze upon. Take care when handling, as the caudal spines can inflict very painful wounds. A period of quarantine can be a valuable procedure for the acclimatisation of all livestock, and it is of particular importance for the Mata Tang which can be fairly susceptible to developing marine whitespot.

Like many other members of this family, it is an aggressive fish that is best maintained in a large fish-only aquarium with tankmates of a similar size and disposition.

This fish does best in mature aquaria containing plenty of live rock for the fish to browse on and forage amongst. As with all butterflyfishes, this species demands excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well-oxygenated, with areas of decent current. Tankmates should be peaceable, and it is best to keep only oneMerten's Butterflyfish per tank. Do not house with any other butterflyfish species particularly close relatives, as this species will show much aggression towards them. Chaetodonmertensii is replaced by the Pearlscale Butterflyfish (C. xanthurus) in south-east Asia, and the Redback Butterflyfish (C. paucifasciatus) in the Red Sea. These species are collectively known as the "xanthuruscomplex". In the wild, C. mertensiiand C. xanthurus are known to hybridize where their ranges overlap. Fish from the Indian Ocean that are sometimes referred to as "C. madagaskariensis", are actually C. mertensii.`,feeding:"Omnivorous.

So close is the resemblance, many fish give it the same wide berth. In the wild, they inhabit clear lagoons and seawards reefs to about 25 metres in depth. Juveniles are often seen in small groups, whereas adult fish are usually found in pairs.
 Compared to many other larger filefish, this species is rather less destructive, but much caution is advised if planning on adding to a reef setting; these fish will pick on most sessile invertebrates with the exception of potent stinging sea anemones such as Stichodactyla spp. (carpet anemones). Snails, shrimp, gorgonians, and sponges are particularly vulnerable. Therefore, this hardy species really is best housed in a tank containing live rock only. Saddled Filefish are generally quite passive and docile, especially when first introduced, and should only be kept with tankmates of a similar size and disposition. It should never be kept in the same tank as its model pufferfish, as the filefish will very likely be bullied. Keep one per tank unless a mated pair can be acquired.
In order to tell the Mimic filefish apart from the Valentini Pufferfish, look for the following: the first transverse bar extends further behind the eye in C. valentini; the second transverse bar courses ventrally between the gill opening and pectoral fin base in C. valentini and behind the pectoral fin in P. prionurus; the dark spots between and below the transverse bars are larger and less numerous in P. prionurus; and very large adult P. prionurus specimens often have a dark spot on the middle of the lower part of the cheek, but no such spot is present in C. valentini.

Depending on location, juveniles of this species display one of three different colour patterns, mimicking different Centropyge species. For instance, in Guam, juvenile fish mimic the Lemon Peel Angelfish (C. flavissimus), but where the Lemon Peel Angelfish is absent in Palau, the juvenile fish instead mimic the Halfblack Angelfish (C. vrolikii). A further colour form replicates that of Herald's Angelfish (C. heraldi). This relationship is Batesian, in that the juvenile tang avoids predation because it resembles the less-palatable angelfish. Adult Mimic Tangs are a dark brown/purplish black colour with an orange patch emanating from the pectoral fin base. A dark band covers the gill opening and arcs down to the chin, with a narrow white band encircling the mouth. The caudal fin is lunate and edged with yellow. Due to an active nature and moderate adult size, the Mimic Tang requires a good sized aquarium with vigorous filtration and plenty of water movement and oxygenation. These fish are generally safe in the reef aquarium, providing they are well fed. A mature tank is necessary to help ensure that your Mimic Tang settles in well; in particular these fish enjoy grazing upon filamentous algae growing upon the decor. Arrange the live rock to create a sloping reef, with plenty of boltholes for the fish, should they feel the need to dash for cover at any time. Keep only one per tank, and not with any other Acanthurus species or direct food competitors, as these fish can be highly territorial. In very large aquaria, it is possible to maintain these fish alongside Tangs of other genera such as Ctenochaetus, Naso, and Zebrasoma - but ideally they should be of a similar size and added simultaneously. However, personalities do vary between individuals, so observe your fish very carefully to ensure that there are no problems.

No matter how often these fish are offered frozen or dried foods, they will starve in a tank without an abundance of mature rockwork, so this must be provided; the fish will prey on the micro-fauna that live amongst the rock, such as tiny shrimps, amphipods, copepods, and small crustaceans, which are easily crushed with its powerful pharyngeal teeth. For this reason, these fish cannot be kept alongside ornamental crustaceans and shrimps, as these items form part of its natural diet. Sessile invertebrates, however, will be perfectly safe. Effective filtration and circulation with a high level of oxygenation are a must in order to maintain optimal water conditions. Tight-fitting coverslides are also essential, as these fish are expert jumpers. Keep only one per tank, unless you can acquire a mated pair or a harem that consists of just one male and several females; the latter two options requiring a vast aquarium. Tankmates should be non-aggressive; if the wrasse is kept alongside large angels or tangs, it will become much more reclusive. Not to be kept alongside any of the dragonet species, as they will be outcompeted for food by the wrasse. As these fish are, unfortunately, somewhat delicate, we would recommend you quarantining a new purchase for several weeks to ensure it is in perfect health and feeding well before adding to your main display aquarium. This species is not suitable for beginners.',feeding:"Very challenging to feed. This species will spend many hours searching out small invertebrates living in amongst the live rock.

In fact, some experts consider S. unimaculatus to be a geographical variant of S. vulpinus, the dark blotch on each flank being the defining feature. You may often see juveniles kept together in large shoals without problems in your local aquatics store, but be aware that as the fish mature, they become intolerant of their own kind within the confines of the aquarium and should be kept singly, with the exception of a bonded male-female pair. Unrelated fish species will be ignored, most giving the One-Spot Fox face a wide berth because of the venomous spines on their dorsal and anal fins. Needless to say, this is a fish that must be handled with much care when catching and acclimatising; ideally it should be gently herded into a submerged fish-bag or solid container, rather than risk using a net to lift it from the water. The fish is likely to erect its fins, entangling the sturdy spines in the netting, and at the same time there is the chance of the aquarist receiving a very painful sting. The tank itself should offer plenty of dark hiding places amongst rockwork, and employ decent filtration and circulation. If adding this species to a reef aquarium, be aware that occasional specimens do have a taste for coral polyps, particularly those that are hungry, so be sure to observe carefully and ensure the fish is receiving enough food. The One-Spot Fox Face has a small mouth that is specially adapted for browsing on algae (the main constituent of its diet). They must receive regular offerings of greenfoods in their diet, otherwise their colours will fade and their health may suffer. Meaty foods can be offered, and indeed will be accepted, but it is very important that rabbitfish receive a decent amount of algae-based foodstuffs as part of their daily nourishment.

Juvenile fish tend to inhabit shallow protected reef environments, whereas the adults (who are usually found singly or in pairs) favour deep coastal reef slopes and outer reef walls where they can be observed feeding on various types of algae growing on the rocks. This species is rarely encountered in the trade, but if the aquarist is blessed with an enormous system, this fish is well worth looking out for as it would make a wonderful centrepiece. The tank should be mature and contain plenty of live rock which the Orange Face Tang will enjoy grazing upon. Include plenty of hiding places that are large enough for your fish to retreat into quickly should it feel threatened, at the same time aiming for an aquascape that allows plenty of open swimming space along the front of the aquarium for such a powerful swimmer. Orange Face Tangs are not overly aggressive towards tankmates, however they will show hostility towards their own kind and towards other members of the Acanthurus genus - for this reason it is best to house just one specimen per tank. There are good reports of this fish mixing with tangs of other genera; however it is recommended that the Orange Face Tang is the last addition to a set up, as it can be a little territorial to newcomers, especially similar fish species. It is best to source a medium sized specimen (i.e. over 4" in length) as they are more likely to acclimatise well to life in captivity. Conversely, extra large specimens may have a difficult time settling in, so aim for a healthy-looking fish that is neither too small nor excessively large. Avoid any specimens that appear "pinched" in the belly area, and do ask your retailer to show you that your chosen fish is feeding well prior to purchase. Orange Face Tangs have a high metabolism and require small frequent feeds throughout the day. Powerful filtration/circulation and a high level of oxygenation are therefore essential for this energetic, voracious eater. Be sure to keep on top of water quality as this fish will not tolerate deteriorating water conditions. A large refugium with living rock can be most useful: macroalgae can be cultured on this rock and these pieces rotated with pieces from the main tank, so that the Orange Face Tang has a continual supply of natural foodstuffs to graze upon. Take care when handling this species, as the caudal spines are large and can inflict a very painful wound. A period of quarantine can be a valuable procedure for the acclimatisation of all livestock, and it is of particular importance for the Orange Face Tang which can be fairly susceptible to developing marine white spot. This can be difficult to treat in the reef aquarium. Ideally the fish should be quarantined and carefully observed in a separate aquarium for at least a fortnight before being introduced into your main display tank. The pictured fish is a 5" juvenile. As these fish mature, their appearance changes, with the fish developing dazzling golden-orange and bright blue markings to the fins against deeper blues, browns, and black, with a maze of orange freckles on the face.

Juvenile fish, which have an all-over bright yellow body colouration with just the slightest hint of blue edging the anal and dorsal fins, inhabit the safer waters of protected bays and lagoons. Adults are a two tone grey colour with a bright orange flash ringed in blue across the 'shoulders', just above the pectoral fins. The caudal fin will take on a beautiful lyre shape as the fish mature. Orange Shoulder Tangs occur singly or in shoals, feeding on diatoms, fine filamentous algae, biofilms, and detritus covering the sand and bare rock. This is a large, active species that requires an XXL aquarium with a good deal of swimming space. Although this fish can attain quite a size, it is not as belligerent as some members of the genus, and will typically ignore tankmates, including other tangs that are of similar disposition. It is usually best to keep only one Orange Shoulder Tang per tank, unless the system is vast and there are an abundance of visual barriers. If conditions are suitable for housing more than one, it is always best to add a juvenile to the aquarium that contains an adult, and not the other way around.  If placing with other tangs (except A. nigricans and A. triostegus, which are less aggressive) add this species first. Generally speaking, this fish is safe in reef aquaria (provided that it is well fed), but do observe carefully.

Orange Spot Gobies like to dig burrows underneath rocks and coral bases, so be sure that any structures are secure, and that there is a good depth of (live) sand in most parts of the aquarium. This will not only enable them to create a burrow, but is also a vital lifeline for them as they sift through this substrate in search for tiny invertebrate food items. The sand is taken in through the mouth, the food items swallowed, and the remaining sand expelled through the gills. These fish are not overly particular where they dump the sand they have sifted, and as it is usually expelled whilst the fish are in motion, it can sometimes end up dropping down onto and swamping prized corals. For this reason, they are not always a welcome addition to aquaria containing delicate coral life, and careful planning is needed.

This leopard wrasse requires a very mature, spacious aquarium with plenty of live rock and sand that supports its natural diet on an ongoing basis, if it is to thrive. If added to a newly set up tank, it will starve to death. There should be plenty of hiding places amongst the rockwork, with enough depth of substrate (7.5cm/3" of fine sand) for the fish to bury if it feels threatened. Because of the difficulties in feeding this leopard wrasse, it should not be kept with fish that require a similar food source to survive, as otherwise one species may out-compete the other. There should be relatively calm areas in the tank that allow it to locate food successfully. Tankmates should be peaceful and of an easygoing nature so that the Peacock Wrasse does not feel harassed and subsequently stops venturing out to feed. Groups can sometimes be kept together successfully (added simultaneously) but larger numbers should only ever be considered for exceptionally large aquaria, as in the average sized aquarium, natural prey will deplete too quickly with that many fish requiring the same diet. Do not house with other Macropharyngodon species or pugnacious dottybacks and hawkfish, as they will fight for territory. When choosing your leopard wrasse, check that its body is not emaciated, and that it is actively searching for food. It is not uncommon for a newly added leopard wrasse to hide beneath the substrate whilst it adjusts to its new surroundings and altered circadian rhythm; in such cases it is best to leave them be, they will usually begin to explore within a couple of days. These fish require stable and optimal water conditions at all times, so a good filtration and maintenance regime is a must. Ensure that the aquarium has tight fitting coverslides with no small gaps in the hood, as these fish are expert jumpers.

However, it is not regarded as completely reef-safe on account of its fondness for feeding on many soft corals and other small invertebrates. Some aquarists have successfully maintained the PearlscaleButterflyfish in reef aquaria; keeping the fish very well fed, and housing alongside only some of the more noxious soft corals that aren't so palatable are seen as key - but caution and careful observation is still advised. This fish does best in mature aquaria containing plenty of live rock for the fish to browse on and forage amongst. As with all butterflyfishes, this species demands excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well-oxygenated, with areas of decent current. Tankmates should be of a peaceable nature, as these fish are relatively shy and shouldn't be kept with more belligerent fish or they may refuse to venture out and feed.

As these fish can be quite territorial, in the average sized aquarium you should aim to keep just one known pair. In XXL aquaria, more than one pair could be kept if they are all added at the same time as juvenile specimens and plenty of visual barriers are provided amongst the dÃ©cor (or in the case of adding host anemones, enough anemones for all the fish, added at the same time as the clowns). If shelters are limited, the dominant clownfish will bully the others, picking them off one-by-one, so careful observation is necessary.

As with other members of the same genus, this goby forms a symbiotic partnership with an almost blind alpheid shrimp; together they share the safety of a burrow which the shrimp digs/maintains, and the goby keeps watch for predators. Whilst the shrimp is working, it maintains antenna contact with its goby partner posted at the entrance of the shared burrow. If the shrimp detects the quivering motion of the goby's caudal fin during an unusual situation, it reacts by immediately withdrawing into the depths of the burrow. The entrance to the shared burrow will be closed at night, and only one entrance is usually open at any one time.The shrimp will only emerge from the burrow whilst it can have tactile contact with the goby. Provided with a reasonable depth of coral sand and a good selection of loose coral rubble pieces that vary in size (not too big to be moved) these gobies can do very well in the home aquarium. The goby will survive without its shrimp partner, but if they can be acquired together, they will make such a fascinating display, captivating the observer for hours on end. Your dealer may be able to acquire the two together, it is certainly worth asking. The Pinkspot Goby is a territorial species, and larger specimens will think nothing of attacking other gobies and even smaller, unrelated species such as wrasses and assessors. However, it is much less likely to be antagonistic if housed in spacious aquaria with plenty of visual barriers (although do remember to include large, open expanses of substrate), and where it is one of the last fishes added to the tank. Hostility normally initially takes the form of jaw gaping, fin flaring, and sideways shoving, but if it is allowed to escalate, real damage may ensue if the goby takes a bite at its adversary, so do observe very carefully. It is best to keep only one specimen per tank unless you can acquire a mated male-female pair, as conspecifics will fight.

Usually found in pairs, Purple Firefish will hover together, feeding on zooplankton in the water column. This species is an ideal candidate for the reef aquarium; it is hardy, colourful, relatively peaceful, and readily acclimatises to aquarium life. The tank should be mature and aquascaped with plenty of live rock so that there are numerous nooks and crannies for your firefish to dart into if startled. There should be areas of brisk water movement and a high level of oxygenation these fish can often be seen hovering in the water column, facing the strong current whilst waiting for microscopic food morsels to drift past. They will never stray too far from cover though. The Purple Firefish is considered one of the more pugnacious of the firefishes, and although it will rarely become aggressive towards other fish species (except close relatives), it is very territorial, and will fight with its own kind unless they are a mated pair. For this reason it is best to either keep a single specimen (particularly in smaller, "nano" aquaria) or acquire a known mated pair. These fish cannot be sexed externally and simply putting two specimens together and hoping for the best is unlikely to work.

A varied diet is a must to keep the fish in good health and for them to display their vibrant colouration. Ideally they will be fed small amounts several times per day (see below). Powerful filtration and protein skimming, plus a good maintenance regime are essential for maintaining optimal water quality despite the heavy nutrient input. As these fish inhabit areas of great tidal surge in the wild, they require vigorous water movement in the home aquarium - a high level of oxygenation at all times being of utmost importance. Randall"'s Anthias goes through one of the most remarkable colour changes of any Anthias species during the transition from female to male. Females are an overall peach colour on the flanks, which merges into yellow on the tail, around the eye, and on the snout. The dorsal, ventral, and anal fins usually have a very thin blue-purple margin to them. The fins will appear rounded and without filaments, with the exception of the third dorsal ray which may be extended in very mature females or in those females which are transitioning into males. In an aquarium population composed entirely of females, the extension of the third dorsal ray is a certain sign of sex change starting to occur. As a female Randalls Anthias changes into a male, a dramatic colour change occurs. The ventral fins develop a thick red band (as can be seen in the above photographed specimen which was undergoing transition) with yellow centre. At this time, the upper lip extends somewhat, giving the fish a slightly more fat-lipped appearance (this is fairly subtle but more obvious when a male and female are compared side by side). As the change progresses further, the anal, caudal, and dorsal fin tips become more angular and develop long filaments; the anal and dorsal fins turning red and magenta, and the caudal fin changing to a blue-purple hue. The iris also changes from yellow to purple. Much later into the transition, the fish eventually develops thick horizontal bands of red and magenta on the flanks.

As with other members of the same genus, this goby forms a symbiotic partnership with an almost blind alpheid shrimp; together they share the safety of a burrow which the shrimp digs/maintains, and the goby keeps watch for predators. Whilst the shrimp is working, it maintains antennal contact with its goby partner posted at the entrance of the shared burrow. If the shrimp detects the quivering motion of the goby"™s caudal fin during an unusual situation, it reacts by immediately withdrawing into the depths of the burrow. The entrance to the shared burrow will be closed at night, and only one entrance is usually open at any one time. The shrimp will only emerge from the burrow whilst it can have tactile contact with the goby. These fish are peaceful, except towards conspecifics (especially males) - so keep only one per tank or else obtain a mated pair. Provided with a reasonable depth of coral sand and a good selection of loose coral rubble pieces that vary in size (not too big to be moved) these gobies can do very well in the home aquarium.

This is a charming little fish that makes a wonderful addition to the reef aquarium. With pretty colouration and a peaceful nature, Red Head Gobies have been known to reproduce in captivity, so would make for an interesting breeding project. As previously mentioned, Red Head Gobies are regularly observed servicing fish that have ectoparasites, helping to control diseases such as Lymphocystis and marine whitespot. An advantage over most other cleaner fishes is that the Red Head Goby is not an "obligate cleaner" (i.e. it does not rely on cleaning/eating parasites for optimal health). As such, the Red Head Goby will do just as well in a healthy aquarium where it is offered quality commercially prepared foodstuffs. This diminutive goby rarely shows aggression towards other species, although it will fight with members of its own kind, especially in smaller aquaria where space and territories are more limited. Large groups (7+) can be kept if the system is spacious; however in smaller aquaria it is advisable to keep either a single specimen or a known mated pair. Although these gobies cannot be sexed externally, it is often fairly easy to pick out a compatible pair at your local aquarium store as they may have paired off and be resting very close to one another. With regards to compatibility, Red Head Gobies are ideal for community reef aquaria; they are also often purported to coexist with a number of unlikely large predators, which usually tend to leave the gobies alone on account of their known cleaning services. However, much caution is necessary as all fish vary in personality and temperament and there can be no guarantees when it comes to their safety with such tankmates present. Observe carefully and if in any doubt, do not add them to your aquarium. It is not advisable to add Red Head Gobies to an aquarium containing predatory crabs.

You will need to ensure that the eggs are very gently aerated in the absence of the parent fish. The time it takes for the eggs to hatch will vary depending on water temperature and other factors, but on average this is usually around 8 days.

Like its close relative, the Scooter Blenny (S. ocellatus), this species has an interesting method of locomotion, using oversized ventral fins to "˜scoot"™ along the substrate and habitually perch as it feeds on microfauna. The blotchy colour pattern allows this species to blend into its environment on the reef with great effect. When keeping the Red Scooter Blenny in the home aquarium, it is vitally important that the tank is fully mature, with plenty of live rock and a living sand bed which will provide the fish with natural foodstuffs. For this reason, although Red Scooter Blennies do not grow especially large, an aquarium with a decent footprint (length and width) is important to provide enough food on a continual basis. Without such nourishment, these fish tend to waste away. In larger aquaria, multiple specimens can be kept together in the same tank, ideally one male, with several females - all of which should be introduced simultaneously. The male will use his elaborate dorsal fin to display to the females during courtship rituals. If more than one male is present, the rivals will both use their dorsal fins as a show of dominance. To keep more than one male in the same tank, the aquarium must be of generous proportions, with plenty of visual barriers, and the specimens added simultaneously when juvenile.

Juveniles are often seen shoaling in groups with adult females and one adult male, along with other species of Cirrhilabrus or Paracheilinus wrasses, as they feed on zooplankton in the water column. This is an all over red-orange fish, with the colour fading to yellow or white ventrally. Dominant males are much more intensely coloured, with larger, brighter red dorsal and anal fins, and long filaments on the ventral fins. The dorsal, anal, and caudal fins also have thin bright blue margins. In the home aquarium, it is best to keep either a single specimen or a group consisting of just one male with several females. Be sure to add the entire group simultaneously, or else add all females before the male. In the confines of the aquarium, large males will behave aggressively towards other fairy wrasses and other small wrasse species introduced after them.

This fish requires an XL mature system if it is to do well in captivity. Ideally the tank will be over 6ft in length, will have been set up for several months, and will include plenty of living rock. Filtration should be oversized, with highly efficient protein skimming and powerful circulation. In the wild, Regal Tangs are found in loose aggregations a metre or so above the substrate in current-swept terraces of the seaward reefs. When startled, they dive for cover amongst the branches of Pocillopora corals. The bulk of their diet is made up of zooplankton, but they do consume some algae. The tank should be aquascaped with a decent amount of living rock to provide welcome bolt holes, leaving an open swimming space along the front of the tank. Regal Tangs should not harm sessile invertebrates, provided that they are feeding well and consuming a balanced diet. This species is not overly aggressive and can be kept in groups if space permits (specimens should be of the same size and introduced simultaneously). Juvenile fish shoal together, but adults require much more territory and will squabble if there is not enough room. For this reason it is best to keep one adult per tank, unless you are blessed with a vast system. Tankmates should be of a peaceable nature and not direct food competitors. Avoid fish that are too boisterous and which might prevent the Regal Tang from feeding, as head and lateral line erosion (HLLE) can quickly develop if the fish is undernourished, as can marine whitespot, which this species is prone to if stressed. Close relatives from the acanthurid (tang/surgeonfish) family are best avoided too. When choosing a Regal Tang for your aquarium, do ensure that they do not look underweight with a "pinched in" appearance, and instead have a nice full-looking body and are alert and inquisitive. A period of quarantine can be a valuable procedure for the acclimatisation of all livestock, and it is of particular importance for the Regal Tang which, as mentioned above, can be quite susceptible to developing whitespot. This can be difficult to treat in the reef aquarium. Ideally the fish should be quarantined and carefully observed in a separate aquarium for at least a fortnight before being introduced into your main display tank.

Juveniles are usually solitary, but adults are often observed feeding in groups on crustaceans and tiny fishes. This elongate wrasse is one of 4 currently known species of Hologymnosus, and although all are hardy, beautiful fish, they do attain a very large adult size. Due to this and their extremely active nature, they require a voluminous aquarium. These fish feed mainly on small, hard-shelled prey including crustaceans and molluscs, so it is a species that should be added to the reef tank with some caution. Although it should not trouble corals, it will feed on a variety of invertebrates (see Reef Aquarium Compatibility section). The tank should be mature and furnished with plenty of living rock to provide feeding opportunities, shady hiding places and visual barriers. There should be a deep sand bed of around 3" (7.5cm) or so, in order that the wrasse may bury itself at night or if startled. Keep either a single specimen, or, if the tank is large enough, a good sized group of 5 or 6 individuals (introduced simultaneously, when young and of the same size). Tankmates must be chosen with care due to the large size attained by these wrasse. Young Ring Wrasses rarely cause problems in a community type set-up, but as they grow, larger adults will prey on small passive fish, e.g. flasher wrasses, fairy wrasses, and firefish, so combinations such as these are best avoided. Powerful filtration and circulation with a high level of oxygenation are a must, as are tight fitting coverslides; these fish are expert jumpers. All male Ring Wrasses are the result of a sex change; these fish are protogynous sequential hermaphrodites and there are three primary phases, their colour and size depending on whether they are terminal phase (TP) males a.k.a "supermales", initial phase (IP) males, or females. All juveniles start out as females. IP males and females have the ability to change into TP males and this switch includes a dramatic change of size and coloration. Once transformed from IP male or female to TP male, the change is permanent. It should be noted that in the aquarium, TP males are particularly territorial. The colour of these fish also depends on age, mood, and geographical location. Juvenile fish sometimes display a thick horizontal dark brown bar along the flanks, closely resembling juveniles of the Blue Blanquillo (Malacathus latovittatus), and other times this horizontal bar fades to brown or yellow, revealing a series of 17-19 thin black vertical bars along the flanks. The caudal fin is also slightly rounded in juveniles. Adult females are a muted black; TP males are deeper bodied with green flanks (sometimes shading to blue-green ventrally) with numerous bluish red bars, often with a pale yellowish bar on body above the origin of anal fin, and the head is light purplish with a few green to blue-green bands radiating from each eye and onto the snout. The caudal fin is emarginate in adult fish.

In the wild, the Ringed Pipefish is known from outer reef slopes, lagoons, and tide pools. Here it the waters are calm and they may be found frequenting caves and crevices, either solitary or in small groups, to depths of 56m (184ft). The home aquarium must be tailored specifically to their needs. Filtration should be thorough, but water movement gentle. Ensure that these fish cannot be drawn against filter intakes or blown into the dÃ©cor by current that is too vigorous.

A fishless refugium can also be utilised to grow suitable foodstuffs on small pieces of live rock for your Rock Beauty, and these placed into the main tank on a rotational basis. Specialised sponge-based frozen foods purposely developed for angelfish are available too. Specimens that do not receive the proper diet may appear to be feeding well, but after a few months, will gradually fade away due to lack of proper nutrition. If you can provide a Rock Beauty with a suitable home and diet, be sure to choose a healthy specimen that is neither too small nor too large (3-4" is about the ideal size) as tiny or adult specimens can be reluctant feeders and tend not to cope with the stress of capture and transport quite so well. Very young fish may even try to feed from the slime coat of other fish within the same aquarium, causing them irritation. Check with your dealer that the fish is feeding well on the correct foods (ask to see this) and that it appears bright and inquisitive. The most suitable aquarium for a Rock Beauty will be extra wide as well as lengthy. This will enable you to aquascape the tank with a large quantity of live rock (which will provide ongoing grazing opportunities, and refuges for when the angelfish is resting or if startled) whilst still being able to maintain a good amount of open swimming space.

It is usually observed in small harems, comprised of one male and several females, browsing the substrate for molluscs and foraminiferans. This elongate wrasse is one of 11 currently known species of Pseudojuloides, and although all are incredibly beautiful, this genus is considered rather delicate and does have some specialist care requirements that must be fulfilled by the advanced aquarist if these fish are to acclimatise well to life in captivity. The Royal Pencil Wrasse requires a very mature, spacious aquarium with plenty of healthy live rock and sand that supports its natural diet on an ongoing basis, if it is to thrive. If added to a newly set up tank, it will starve to death. There should be plenty of hiding places amongst the rockwork, with enough depth of substrate (7.5cm/3" of fine sand) for the fish to bury if it feels threatened. Because of the difficulties in feeding this wrasse, it should not be kept with fish that require a similar food source to survive, as otherwise one species may out-compete the other. There should be relatively calm areas in the tank that allow it to locate food successfully. Tankmates should be peaceful and of an easygoing nature so that the Royal Pencil Wrasse does not feel harassed and subsequently stops venturing out to feed. Keep only one male per tank; groups, comprised of one male and several females, can sometimes be kept together successfully (added simultaneously) but larger numbers should only ever be considered for exceptionally voluminous aquaria, as in the average sized aquarium, natural prey will deplete too quickly with that many fish requiring the same diet. Do not house with different Pseudojuloides species, other wrasses, or pugnacious dottybacks and hawkfishes, as they will fight for territory. When choosing your Royal Pencil Wrasse, check that its body is not emaciated, and that it is actively searching for food. It is not uncommon for a newly added pencil wrasse to hide beneath the substrate whilst it adjusts to its new surroundings and altered circadian rhythm; in such cases it is best to leave them be, they will usually begin to explore within a couple of days. These fish require stable and optimal water conditions at all times, so a good filtration and maintenance regime is a must.

This diminutive, bright scarlet and yellow fish is found amongst areas of broken coral rubble that is interspersed with outcrops of soft and stony corals, to depths of 38m (125ft). Like its close relative, the Scooter Blenny, this species has an interesting method of locomotion, using oversized ventral fins to "scoot" along the substrate and habitually perch as it feeds on microfauna. Although this fish has been seen in the trade for several years, it has only recently been formally described. When keeping the Ruby Red Dragonet in the home aquarium, it is vitally important that the tank is fully mature, with plenty of live rock and a living sand bed which will provide the fish with natural foodstuffs. For this reason, although Ruby Red Dragonets do not grow especially large, an aquarium with a decent footprint (length and width) is important to provide enough food on a continual basis. Without such nourishment, these fish tend to waste away. In larger aquaria, multiple specimens can be kept together in the same tank, ideally one male, with several females - all of which should be introduced simultaneously. The male will use his elaborate dorsal fin to display to the females during courtship rituals. If more than one male is present, the rivals will both use their dorsal fins as a show of dominance. To keep more than one male in the same tank, the aquarium must be of generous proportions, with plenty of visual barriers, and the specimens added simultaneously when juvenile. Tankmates should be small and peaceful, so that the Ruby Red Dragonet is not bullied or harassed at feeding times. Do not keep with anemones, as these docile bottom dwellers are likely to be consumed. The Red Ruby Dragonet (S. sycorax) is very similar in appearance to S. tudorjonesi from Cenderawasih Bay, Indonesia, although the latter tends to lack the intense yellow colour of the ventral and pectoral fins, the white markings on the head, and has much reduced white markings over the body. In addition, the first dorsal-fin spine is the longest in S. sycorax, whereas the third spine is longest in S. tudorjonesi.

Also, ensuring that the fish is well-fed means that it should not pose any real threat to reef aquaria - although occasional specimens may nip at some invertebrate life (see below) it should be noted that this only usually occurs if dietary requirements and feeding frequency are not being met. Careful observation is recommended. The Rusty Angelfish should be kept singly and not with any other members of the Centropyge genus.

Juveniles are solitary and stay close inshore, whereas adults are encountered further out in pairs or small aggregations, where they may be observed feeding on coral polyps, filamentous algae, fish eggs, and small invertebrates. This species is regarded as moderately difficult, and is therefore recommended for advanced aquarists only. A large, mature system is requisite, along with ample live rock for the fish to browse upon/hide amongst and a large open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Medium sized specimens tend to acclimatise better to aquarium life, adapting much more quickly to various prepared foods, so try and choose a healthy, alert specimen around 10cm (4") in length. Smaller sized fish may be reluctant to feed, and larger specimens can be very finicky, requiring significant space and faultless water conditions. An aquarium that has some areas of lush filamentous algae growth will also aid your new fish in settling into its new surroundings; however, as with other butterflyfish species, these fish demand excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of brisk current. Some aquarists have successfully kept Saddleback Butterflyfish alongside some of the more noxious soft corals, but this is something of a risk, and they should be observed carefully. Stony corals and other sessile invertebrates will be constantly nipped at, so unfortunately must be avoided. Keep only one Saddleback Butterflyfish per tank (unless a mated pair is acquired) and not with any other butterflyfish as they will squabble over territories. Whilst they can be a little shy when first introduced, providing them with ample retreats amongst the live rock will ensure they quickly gain confidence and venture out into the open.

This is a popular and robust aquarium fish which thrives in mature reef aquaria. A host anemone - some of which can be a little tricky to maintain successfully in captivity - is not strictly necessary for your clownfish as most reef set ups contain plenty of hiding places, no large predatory fish, and sometimes cleaner shrimp/cleaner wrasse. In the absence of an anemone, some clownfish take up residence in what they see as a suitable coral substitute - which may cause them to retract in irritation as the clownfish wallow - but this isn"™t always the case. Many species of clownfish (including the Saddleback) are now captive-raised, so wherever possible the conscientious aquarist should aim to source these hardier specimens for the home aquarium, in turn helping to take pressure off the reefs. This is a beautiful but variable species, with a brown, orange, or almost black body. There is a thick white vertical bar behind each eye, a large white saddle shaped marking dorsally over the centre of the body, and thick white edging to the black caudal fin; sometimes there is an additional white marking over the caudal peduncle. As these fish can be somewhat territorial, keep only one pair per tank, providing them with ample space and plenty of visual barriers amongst the dÃ©cor. It is also best not to mix this species with other species of clownfish as they will fight. With regards to sexing, all clownfish are born as males. A wild colony may consist of a breeding pair, which cohabit with a few non-reproductive smaller male specimens. When the female dies, the dominant male will change sex and become the female. This is known as protandrous sequential hermaphroditism. In the case of two juvenile specimens in the home aquarium, the larger of the two will become the female.

This brightly coloured fish is of a peaceful nature and makes a wonderful addition to mature reef aquaria containing colonies of SPS corals; these fish very much enjoy swimming and hiding amongst such polyps. Although often recommended for nano aquaria because of its diminutive size, caution should be exercised for two reasons. Firstly, smaller tanks will limit the number of individuals you can keep together; only one specimen is recommended in small nano type tanks, otherwise there will be constant arguments over territory which could result in the untimely demise of the weaker individual. Secondly, the more space available in a reef setting, the chances are that there will be much larger, stable colonies of suitable SPS corals available, and so it is less likely that these fish will damage any one individual beyond repair as they go about their daily routines (hiding/resting amongst the branches, and feeding on the occasional mucous polyp). If these types of corals are not being cultivated in your aquarium, invest in several coral skeletons so that these fish have something natural to interact with and give them a sense of security. Saffron Coral Gobies may be kept in groups (but only in larger quarters where there is an abundance of hiding places/territories), and oftentimes these fish will pair up and spawn.

When keeping the Scooter Blenny in the home aquarium, it is vitally important that the tank is fully mature, with plenty of live rock and a living sand bed which will provide the fish with natural foodstuffs. For this reason, although Scooter Blennies do not grow especially large, an aquarium with a decent footprint (length and width) is important to provide enough food on a continual basis. Without such nourishment, these fish tend to waste away. In larger aquaria, multiple specimens can be kept together in the same tank, ideally one male, with several females - all of which should be introduced simultaneously. The male will use his elaborate dorsal fin to display to the females during courtship rituals. If more than one male is present, the rivals will both use their dorsal fins as a show of dominance. To keep more than one male in the same tank, the aquarium must be of generous proportions, with plenty of visual barriers, and the specimens added simultaneously when juvenile.

In the confines of the home aquarium, established Tangs can become rather territorial and so must be provided with a generously sized tank - as not only is ample swimming space required, but specimens kept in smaller quarters can become very aggressive. It is easiest to keep to just one Zebrasoma in the aquarium, as they don't often accept other members of the same genus. Other tangs from different genera (such as the Regal Tang or Lipstick Tang) with a visibly different appearance may be accepted if the fish are added simultaneously. The tank should be mature with plenty of algal growth for these herbivores to browse, especially filamentous types which the fish will harvest effortlessly using their long snouts and specialised pharyngeal teeth. It is of utmost importance that they receive an appropriate diet consisting of a variety of greenfoods, in order to prevent Head & Lateral Line Erosion (HHLE). As long as this fish is kept well fed, it should not pose any problems in a reef set up. Occasional specimens have been known to nip at stony corals, and even some soft corals, but this is not the norm. A decent current and highly oxygenated conditions will serve this fish well.

Juveniles sport yellowish bars and prominent yellow specks on the body, as well as oversized dorsal fins. Adults are usually dark brown posteriorly with fine pale blue-green longitudinal lines following scale rows, which gradually become white dots anteriorly on the body and head. There are also many natural geographical colour variants, including black, grey, or greenish, and some individuals also exhibit blotched patterns of more than one colour, including yellow.

Be sure to keep on top of water quality; powerful filtration, brisk circulation, and a high level of oxygenation are essential for this voracious eater. Spanish Hogfish are fiercely territorial so it is recommended to keep only one specimen per tank, and not with any other hogfish species, or with any small, docile fish.

This is a species notorious for readily excreting the poison ostracitoxin when stressed - a deadly toxin which is capable of wiping out an entire tank. It is therefore best to house either a single specimen or one male-female pair. Never keep more than one male in the same tank as bickering and subsequent ostracitoxin release is very likely to occur. If tankmates are desired, they must be peaceful so as not to harass the boxfish; however, their continued safety will be precarious, hence why a species-only set up is highly recommended. In the wild, Spotted Boxfish inhabit clear lagoons and reefs. They are considered relatively poor swimmers and for this reason have developed protection via toxin release. The impressive teeth are used to scrape tunicates and sponges off of rocks, which form the bulk of the diet along with various algae, bivalves, snails, polychaete worms, molluscs etc. For this reason, these fish are not suited to reef tanks, although there should be some live rock in the tank to provide welcome shelters and grazing opportunities. A large open swimming space should be provided so that the boxfish are able to swim out and about during daylight hours when they are usually at their most active. Despite their less-than-nimble method of locomotion, Spotted Boxfish are capable of jumping from open topped tanks, so tight fitting coverslides are a must. Care must be taken when carrying out maintenance on the aquarium, so as to keep the fish as calm as possible. Ideally the tank will be situated where there is as little foot traffic going past as possible too. Lights should turn on and off very gradually via the use of a dimmer - sudden bright light can shock the boxfish into toxin release. All foods should be offered towards the bottom of the tank to avoid the boxfish drawing in air when trying to take food from the surface. Boxfish have very small mouths and stomachs and it is of extreme importance that they are fed small amounts throughout the day to prevent starvation (something which may not always be immediately apparent because of the rigid bony plates along the sides of the boxfish).

The aquarium should be mature and incorporate plenty of live rock. The presence of healthy established colonies of branching corals is essential, as this is where the Spotted Coral Croucher will take up residence. In the wild, these fish are found in shallow reefs that undergo powerful surge action, so decent water movement, oxygenation, and filtration is important. Keep only one per tank unless your supplier can source you a mated pair. Tankmates should be of a peaceful nature as Spotted Coral Crouchers are very shy feeders and are easily out-competed. It is best to ensure your chosen fish is feeding well before purchase (ask to see the fish being fed) and also whilst it is in quarantine prior to adding to your main display tank. Target feeding small meaty foods with a turkey baster can very much help to ensure your Spotted Coral Croucher is receiving the nutrition it needs, and starting this during the quarantine period can help your fish get used to this process. As they rarely venture out very far from their chosen coral to take food from open water, the aquarist must be prepared to regularly target feed the fish in this way, aiming the food directly into the places where the fish are resting. Take care when handling Spotted Coral Crouchers during acclimatisation and when carrying out maintenance, as they are mildly venomous. Although always rather reclusive, well-settled specimens can become relatively tame, watching everything that the aquarist is doing with much interest (in a manner akin to hawkfish).

  Cheap and extremely hardy, juvenile Humbugs are very attractive and reef-friendly, but grow into extremely aggressive fish that are likely to terrorise their tankmates. As with all damsels other than clownfish, dominant fish become male. Social groupings consist of a single territorial male, one or more females and unsexed juvenile fish. In the aquarium a stable group can be created, ideally by mixing individuals of different sizes that duplicate this natural order, or allowing sufficient space for weaker fish to escape serious harassment until a dominant individual develops. Any new humbugs added should be significantly smaller than established ones, duplicating the recruitment of juveniles from the plankton. Expect the male to defend a spawning site vigorously from all intruders apart from females ready to spawn.
  Their aquarium should be spacious and include plenty of rockwork to break sightlines and create hiding spots; try to aquascape it in such a way as to create several visual barriers as this will help to minimise aggression levels. Although hardy, good filtration is a must and decent water movement will be appreciated. Peaceful tankmates are likely to be killed in all but the largest aquaria.
Humbugs are an active, interesting species to keep but do need to be kept in a stocking scheme that is well thought out beforehand. Removing them from a well-furnished tank will be extremely difficult at a later stage and adding any new fishes can be extremely challenging.

They are closely associated with both the Bubble Anemone (Entacmaea quadricolor) and the Sebae Anemone (Heteractis crispa), that afford them lifelong protection from predators and skin parasites. This is a popular and robust aquarium fish which thrives in mature reef aquaria. A host anemone - some of which can be a little tricky to maintain successfully in captivity - is not strictly necessary for your clownfish as most reef set ups contain plenty of hiding places, no large predatory fish, and sometimes cleaner shrimp/cleaner wrasse. In the absence of an anemone, some clownfish take up residence in what they see as a suitable coral substitute - which may cause them to retract in irritation as the clownfish wallow - but this isn"™t always the case. Many species of clownfish (including the Tomato) are now captive-raised, so wherever possible the conscientious aquarist should aim to source these hardier specimens for the home aquarium, in turn helping to take pressure off the reefs. This is a colourful species, with a vivid tomato red-orange coloured body and a vertical white stripe behind the eyes. Captive raised fish tend to be slightly darker in colouration when young, but soon turn a bright orange-red. As these fish can be somewhat territorial, keep only one pair per tank, providing them with ample space and plenty of visual barriers amongst the decor. It is also best not to mix this species with other species of clownfish as they will fight. With regards to sexing, all clownfish are born as males. A wild colony may consist of a breeding pair, which cohabit with a few non-reproductive smaller male specimens. When the female dies, the dominant male will change sex and become the female. This is known as protandrous sequential hermaphroditism. In the case of two juvenile specimens in the home aquarium, the larger of the two will become the female.

Prior to spawning, the male will begin biting at the substrate in increasing frequency and intensity in the hopes of attracting a female. If a ripe female accepts him, she may join him with the substrate biting (although the female does not always do this). The pair will then choose a spawning site, usually a smooth rocky surface such as a flat wall inside a cave, and if a host anemone is present, the spawning site will usually be within close vicinity for protection. Several hundred elliptical red-coloured eggs will be deposited. These adhere to the substrate via fine threads at the ventral pole, and the male will aerate them by fanning them with his pectoral fins whilst guarding against predators. The eggs will hatch after 7-10 days, and the larvae typically settle after another 9 days or so. The tiny fry are left to fend for themselves and should be fed on suitably tiny foodstuffs such as live rotifers, moving on to baby brineshrimp after a few days.

Here this species usually occurs in pairs and together they excavate a shallow burrow from bits of rubble and use this as a safe refuge. A large mature reef aquarium with a deep sand bed and a well-established refugium are essential for this species, which is recommended for advanced aquarists only. Twostripe Gobies like to dig burrows underneath rocks and coral bases, so be sure that any structures are secure, and that there is a good depth of (live) sand in most parts of the aquarium. This will not only enable them to create a burrow, but is also a vital lifeline for them as they sift through this substrate in search for tiny invertebrate food items. The sand is taken in through the mouth, the food items swallowed, and the remaining sand expelled through the gills. These fish are not overly particular where they dump the sand they have sifted, and as it is usually expelled whilst the fish are in motion, it can sometimes end up dropping down onto and swamping prized corals. For this reason, they are not always a welcome addition to aquaria containing delicate coral life, and careful planning is needed. However, if their requirements can be met, it must be said that these fish do a remarkably good job of overturning the substrate and keeping it looking fresh. Wherever possible, this is a species that should be maintained in a compatible pair. Twostripe Gobies should not be kept alongside other members of the Valenciennea genus as they will quarrel. The most significant and diagnostic characteristic for this species is the presence of a pair of parallel lines running horizontally across the length of  the body.

These strange-looking fish are found in relatively shallow waters with a maximum depth of 15m (49ft). Capable of dramatic colour change, the benthic Warty Frogfish uses this extraordinary camouflage technique to blend effortlessly into its surroundings, and depending where it is resting, may appear white, cream, yellow, orange, brown, or black, with blotches/saddles of contrasting colour (usually rusty-red or pink). This is a solitary species which is most often found sitting virtually immobile in prominent perches amongst sponges or soft corals, sporadically waving its esca (lure) and instantly ambushing  any passing small fishes that are attracted by this bait. The esca is the shape of a very small fish or shrimp, and is attached to the front of the face via a long, thin illicium (a thread-like, modified first dorsal spine).

Juveniles are often associated with weedy areas of estuaries where there is ample cover for them to develop in relative safety. Adults are usually solitary and fairly territorial. They typically feed on various types of algae (including coralline), mollusks, crabs, tunicates, sponges, corals, zoanthids, tube worms, and echinoderms; feeding on hard prey keeps the beak from overgrowing. Therefore due to such eating habits, these fish are not suitable for keeping in a reef setting in the home aquarium. As Whitespotted Pufferfish tend to attain quite a size, a very large tank will be needed to house an adult specimen. Despite its eventual size, this species is relatively gentle for a puffer, although it must still be considered a semi-aggressive fish. Keep only one per tank and not with any other pufferfish; ideally, tankmates will be of similar size and temperament. The aquarium should be aquascaped with plenty of rockwork, with some large-sized shelters, and an open swimming space along the front. Filtration must be efficient to cope with the voracious eating habits and large amounts of waste that these fish produce, yet water movement should not be too vigorous. Be aware that large pufferfish are notorious for biting through tubing, and even heaters, so it is worth thinking very carefully about where you place your equipment; do also always keep a close eye on where the fish is when carrying out any maintenance in the tank. The general coloration of the White-spotted Pufferfish is an overall grey-brown, with the back, sides, and caudal fin speckled with white spots. The belly area is marked with white stripes. These markings lend themselves to the alternative common name of the Stars and Stripes Puffer. As the fish mature, the white spots appear smaller in proportion to the rest of the fish. When frightened, these fish can inflate themselves to more than twice their original size to deter predators. This defense mechanism is a last resort, and should never be actively encouraged; it is particularly dangerous if the fish ingests air instead of water. Kept in the right conditions, the Whitespotted Puffer will become a real "pet fish" with bags of personality, soon learning to recognize its owner and beg for food.

The pelvic fins are a contrasting bright yellow colour, and the tail takes on a similar hue as the fish mature. This semi-aggressive, active species attains a good size and can be rather territorial, so a spacious aquarium is therefore required. It is usually best to keep only one per tank, unless the system is vast and there is an abundance of visual barriers. If you wish to keep other tangs in the same tank, it is best to opt for Ctenochaetus, Naso, or Zebrasoma species - added simultaneously - as these will be best tolerated by the Whitespotted Tang, rather than other fish from the same genus (Acanthurus). However, personalities do vary between individuals, so observe your fish very carefully to ensure that there are no problems.

Powerful filtration and protein skimming, plus a good maintenance regime are essential for maintaining optimal water quality despite the heavy nutrient input.

These solitary fish are considered relatively poor swimmers and for this reason, developed protection via toxin release. Unfortunately, keeping YellowBoxfish in the home aquarium is very risky. This is a species notorious for readily excreting the poison ostracitoxin when stressed - a deadly toxin that is capable of wiping out an entire tank. Never keep more than one in the same tank as bickering and subsequent ostracitoxin release is very likely to occur. If tankmates are desired, they must be peaceful so as not to harass the boxfish; however, their continued safety will be precarious, hence why an aspecies-only set up is highly recommended. These fish have impressive teeth which are used to scrape algae (containing various microorganisms) tunicates and sponges off of rocks, and this forms the bulk of the diet along with various bivalves, snails, polychaete worms, mollusks, foraminiferans, and small fishes. For this reason, Yellow Boxfish are not suited to reef tanks, although there should be some live rock in the tank to provide welcome shelters and grazing opportunities. The tank must be very spacious and a large open swimming area should be provided so that the boxfish is able to swim out and about during daylight hours when usually they are at their most active. Despite their less-than-nimble method of locomotion, Yellow Boxfish is capable of jumping from open-topped tanks, so tight-fitting coverslides are a must. Care must be taken when carrying out maintenance on the aquarium, so as to keep the fish as calm as possible. Ideally, the tank will be situated where there is as little traffic going past as possible. Lights should turn on and off very gradually via the use of a dimmer - sudden bright light can shock the boxfish into toxin release. All foods should be offered towards the bottom of the tank to avoid the boxfish drawing in air when trying to take food from the surface. Boxfish have very small mouths and stomachs and it is of extreme importance that they are fed small amounts throughout the day to prevent starvation(something which may not always be immediately apparent because of the rigid bony plates along the sides of the boxfish). On account of this feeding regime, highly efficient filtration and protein skimming is a must.

The modified ventral fins have fused to form a kind of suction cup that helps them to maintain position on coral branches in swift currents. Yellow Coral Gobies are generally of a peaceful nature and make a wonderful addition to mature reef aquaria containing established colonies of broad-branching SPS corals, which they very much enjoy hiding amongst. Although often recommended for nano aquaria because of its diminutive size, caution should be exercised for two reasons. Firstly, smaller tanks will limit the number of individuals you can keep together; only one specimen is recommended in small nano type tanks, otherwise there will be constant arguments over territory which could result in the untimely demise of the weaker individual. Secondly, the more space available in a reef setting, the chances are that there will be much larger, stable colonies of suitable SPS corals available, and so it is less likely that these fish will damage any one individual beyond repair as they go about their daily routines (hiding/resting amongst the branches, and feeding on the occasional mucous polyp). If these types of corals are not being cultivated in your aquarium, invest in several coral skeletons so that these fish have something natural to interact with and give them a sense of security. Yellow Coral Gobies may be kept in groups (but only in larger quarters where there is an abundance of hiding places/territories), and oftentimes these fish will pair up and spawn.

These fish tend to strip a small area of coral polyps in order to create a place to deposit their eggs, although other sites are not unheard of. The male fish will dance/quiver in front of the female and when she is ready to spawn, she will deposit her eggs on the coral branch, and these are immediately fertilised and subsequently guarded by the male.

A good-sized, mature system is requisite, along with ample live rock for the fish to browse upon/hide amongst and a large open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Medium sized specimens tend to acclimatise better to aquarium life, adapting much more quickly to various prepared foods, so try to choose a healthy, alert specimen around 9cm (3.5") in length.

Here, this elongate bottom-dweller may be found in the narrow nooks and crannies between rocks and corals, at a maximum depth of 50m (164ft). It typically feeds overnight, with xanthid crabs making up the bulk of the diet, but will also take other crustaceans, molluscs, and urchins. Close-set, pebble-like teeth enable these eels to crush hard-shelled prey with ease. The aquarium should be spacious and mature, with a soft sandy substrate. Create plenty of narrow, shady refuges in the rockwork that the eel can explore and hide amongst, ensuring that all decor is stable and cannot be undermined. Suitable crevices should have a fairly narrow entrance hole but be roomy enough behind for the eel to conceal its entire body within. Unfortunately, this fish is not recommended for reef aquaria, as although small fish are rarely taken, ornamental invertebrates will be eaten without exception, and corals which are not securely attached to the rockwork may be accidentally toppled. The Zebra Eel grows large and is a voracious eater, so ensure that the filtration/protein skimming is very efficient, with areas of brisk water movement and some calmer resting spots out of the current. This fish is relatively mild-mannered and reclusive, but it can become more pugnacious at feeding times. Conspecifics are not well tolerated, so it is best to maintain just one Zebra Eel per tank. Companions can include many medium-large sized fish that thrive in a fish-only set up. Ensure that the aquarium has tight fitting coverslides and no gaps where equipment feeds into the tank, as these fish are proficient escape artists. Whilst most moray eels are poorly suited to life in the home aquarium, the Zebra Eel is an excellent candidate for those willing to set-up a tank around its specific needs.

As adults, these shoaling fish gather in numbers to feed on the abundance of zooplankton that the currents deliver. Hemitaurichthys is an often overlooked genus, containing 4 known species. It is a shame that they are not seen more often in the trade, as these are relatively hardy fish that acclimatize well to aquarium life, and if well fed, they usually pose no problems in reef aquaria that house some of the more noxious soft corals. A number of aquarists have even found them to be completely reef-safe, but as with such matters, "your mileage may vary", and we would recommend exercising caution and careful observation. Zoster Butterflyfish grow reasonably large and are an active species, so a spacious aquarium that allows room for both ample live rock and a decent swimming space along the front of the tank is requisite. Ideally, these peaceful species will be maintained in small groups, as it prefer to live in aggregations - intraspecific aggression should not be an issue here. It is best to try and obtain medium-sized specimens of between 7.5 and 12.5cm in length,as these always adapt to aquarium life much more readily than those that are very small or very large. If planning on adding a group (and this is best for their long-term well-being), try to obtain specimens that are all of roughly equal sizes, and add all to the tank simultaneously. They should be the only butterflyfish species in the aquarium, and if at all possible, tankmates should be of similar size and temperament. Any fish that could be considered as mildly aggressive should be added after the Zoster Butterflyfish have established their territories, and only if the tank offers sufficient space and ample visual barriers amongst the rockwork. Never try to house these fish with boisterous feeders as they are likely to intimidate the butterflies at feeding time. Ensure that the water is thoroughly filtered and well-oxygenated, and provide areas of brisk current. As with all butterflyfishes, they are always going to be much less likely to pick on coral sand other invertebrates if they are well fed and given plenty of space and distractions. This species is also known as the Black Pyramid Butterflyfish or Brown & White Butterflyfish. The intensity of the brown-black areas on this fish can vary depending on the mood, time of day etc. It is replaced by the yellow and white Pyramid Butterflyfish (H.polylepsis) at Christmas and Cocos-Keeling Islands.',feeding:"Offer a variety of tiny and small frozen foods, in small amounts several times per day e.g. plankton, baby brine shrimp (Artemia nauplii),vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, Mysis shrimp, Angel & Butterfly Mix, and finely chopped krill.
