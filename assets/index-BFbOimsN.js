However, this attractive, sought-after fish is one of the more demanding members of the Acanthurus genus and is suitable for advanced aquarists only. The aquarium must be spacious, mature, have a vigorous water flow, and contain plenty of live rock which the Achilles Tang will enjoy grazing upon. Include plenty of hiding places that are large enough for your fish to retreat into quickly should it feel threatened, at the same time aiming for an aquascape that allows plenty of open swimming space along the front of the aquarium for such a powerful swimmer. Achilles Tangs are not usually overly aggressive towards tankmates (although rogue specimens have been known), however they will show much hostility towards their own kind and towards other tangs - particularly other members of the Acanthurus genus - so for this reason it is best to house just one specimen per tank and not with any other tangs. It is recommended that the Achilles Tang is the last addition to a set up, as it can be a little territorial to newcomers, especially similar fish species. It is best to source a medium sized specimen (i.e. over 4" in length) as they are more likely to acclimatise well to life in captivity. Conversely, extra large specimens may have a difficult time settling in, so aim for a healthy-looking fish that is neither too small nor excessively large. Avoid any specimens that appear "pinched" in the belly area, and do ask your retailer to show you that your chosen fish is feeding well prior to purchase. Achilles Tangs have a high metabolism and require small frequent feeds throughout the day. Powerful filtration/circulation and a high level of oxygenation are therefore essential for this energetic, voracious eater. Be sure to keep on top of water quality as this fish will not tolerate deteriorating water conditions. A large refugium with living rock can be most useful: macroalgae can be cultured on this rock and these pieces rotated with pieces from the main tank, so that the Achilles Tang has a continual supply of natural foodstuffs to graze upon. Take care when handling this species, as the caudal spines are large and can inflict a very painful wound. A period of quarantine can be a valuable procedure for the acclimatisation of all livestock, and it is of particular importance for the Achilles Tang which can be fairly susceptible to developing marine whitespot. This can be difficult to treat in the reef aquarium. Ideally the fish should be quarantined and carefully observed in a separate aquarium for at least a fortnight before being introduced into your main display tank. May also be seen on sale as the Red Tail Tang. Juvenile fish display an orange caudal peduncle spine; the large orange teardrop marking in this area appearing as the fish mature. In the wild, the Achilles Tang has been known to hybridise with the Gold Rim Tang (A. nigricans). ***Prior to purchase, please bear in mind that the Achilles Tang is a very demanding species that requires an aquarium planned around its well-being; the tang should be made the centrepiece of the tank, with all the other variables worked around to suit its specific needs. Experienced aquarists only***',feeding:"Feed a varied diet for omnivores, with a large vegetable component, in small amounts several times per day. Although this species will browse on algae within the aquarium, its diet must be supplemented with frozen herbivore rations, green marine flake, Spirulina (blue-green algae), Spirulina-enriched brineshrimp, cucumber, courgette, lettuce, broccoli, Nori (dried seaweed) etc. It will also take meaty frozen foods such as Mysis, but be sure that it is receiving enough green food to help prevent HLLE.

An imposing, large-growing species, the Addis Butterflyfish is best suited to very spacious, mature aquaria with an abundance of live rock for the fish to browse upon and forage amongst, together with a roomy swimming space along the front of the tank. Unfortunately, all stony corals, many soft corals and a whole host of other invertebrates will be picked at and eaten, but some of the more noxious soft corals are usually safe if the butterflyfish is kept well fed. As with all butterflies, this species demands excellent water quality at all times - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of brisk current. Addis Butterflyfish are relatively peaceful and are best maintained in groups of 5 or more, added simultaneously, and preferably with all being of similar size to one another; bearing in mind that juvenile fish tend to acclimatise more readily than larger adults. Tankmates should be of similar size and temperament. Avoid housing with other species of butterflyfish as territorial issues are likely to arise.

Whilst many of the Fang or Sabre-Toothed Blennies are known to parasitize other fish, those from the Meiacanthus genus (of which 28 species have been formerly described) feed only on zooplankton as they hover in the water column, and on tiny benthic invertebrates they find on the reef. Juvenile African Blennies tend to gather in small groups, whereas the adults are solitary or seen in pairs. Meiacanthus species tend to be quite inoffensive, but they do possess two venomous canine-like teeth in the lower jaw that can be employed should they be attacked. Most fish know to leave them alone, but if they are ingested, a quick, sharp bite on the inside of the predator"™s mouth from the blenny ensures that it is spat out again "“ and it is usually none the worse for wear. These fish do not employ their weaponry in an active manner, instead they use it only as a last resort to defend themselves or their territory. Whilst African Blennies can sometimes be a little secretive, they are generally far more self-assured than other blenniids (most likely due to the possession of such potent defensive apparatus) and will often be seen hovering about in the water column above the rockwork in an inquisitive manner. Provide the African Blenny with a mature tank that contains an abundance of live rock, so that it may continually graze upon it for small crustaceans; without such quantity of well-established rockwork, these fish will not fare very well. It is best to keep just one specimen per tank, unless you can acquire a known mated pair, as these fish can be a little territorial in the confines of the average aquarium. Will cohabit with most species, except for close relatives and much larger carnivorous fish. Ensure that the tank has tight fitting coverslides as these fish are expert jumpers. Please be aware that whilst the bites of Fang Blennies are not usually dangerous to most people, they can be very painful. Therefore some degree of caution is required when carrying out maintenance in the aquarium, taking particular care not to intrude too closely upon their territory.

This is a fish that has an appetite for pest anemones (Aiptasia spp.) but in the wild, feeds primarily on amphipods, molluscs, and polychaetes, along with some plant matter. These well-camouflaged fish will indeed eat Aiptasia, but older specimens may also pick on coral polyps, and for this reason they are not considered totally reef safe. However, in a vast system with an abundance of fast-growing corals, and if the fish are kept well-fed, this may not be so much of an issue. In smaller quarters though, they are more suited to a fish-only set-up. A safer option for the natural eradication of Aiptasia in reef aquaria would be Peppermint Shrimps (Lysmata wurdemanni). A. tomentosus is a shy, peaceful species that can be kept alongside other fish of similar size and temperament but may lose out to more aggressive feeders in some communities.

The tank must be well established, and of a good size; algae blennies have been known to starve in smaller quarters once the main food source has been depleted and not had time to re-establish. When algae blennies feed, skip over rocks, graze decor and generally go about their business, they tend to stir up detritus where it goes into suspension and is then removed by the filtration. As this species requires a mature tank, it works out well that this should be amongst the last fish added to the tank, preferably at a size around 5cm, where it should not be over-dominant. Algae blennies can be fairly feisty and quite territorial over their favoured parts of the aquarium, particularly as they mature; therefore it is best to keep only one per tank, and careful consideration should be given to tankmates - avoiding other blennies unless you are blessed with a tank of vast proportions incorporating a huge number of visual barriers amongst the rockwork, and more than enough food to go round on a continual basis. It should be noted that algae blennies will not feed on every kind of algae - they particularly relish the filamentous type, but will ignore bubble and slime algae.

The eggs should hatch within 3-6 days (temperature dependent) and they remain in a larval state for around 30 days. As soon as the eggs hatch, parental care ceases, so you will need to separate the young from the parents and any other fish in the tank just prior to this event. Raising the larvae to adult fish is possible, but very challenging - you will need a ready supply of miniscule foodstuffs such as rotifers available at all times and water quality/tank hygiene must be continually monitored.

At night, these fish feed on small benthic and planktonic crustaceans, in groups that sometimes number up to 200 specimens. In the home aquarium, it is important to provide a spacious reef setting with plenty of shady overhangs, nooks, and crannies. Just as essential is maintaining Banggai Cardinalfish in good sized groups (8+) due to their gregarious nature. Try to obtain fish that are the same size and add all simultaneously. Occasional minor scuffles may occur - usually consisting of chasing, nudging, and fin-flicking - but no real harm should ensue providing there is sufficient space and plenty of visual barriers amongst the decor. However, problems will arise if the group is too small and if the tank lacks space. In smaller set ups, it is best to house a known male-female pair only. Although tank bred specimens are considered relatively hardy, water quality should not be neglected; good filtration is a must and brisk water movement will be much appreciated. Tankmates can include other small, peaceful fish, even other cardinalfish species. Do avoid anything large and boisterous as cardinalfish are easily intimidated and may refuse to come out and feed. Also, be aware that although Banggai Cardinalfish are very placid, they are actually micropredators; therefore small shrimp and very tiny fish may be viewed as food items by larger specimens. Wild Banggai Cardinalfish are currently listed as "Endangered" on the IUCN redlist of threatened species. Thankfully, however, their readiness to reproduce in the aquarium has enabled breeding for the aquatics trade on a large scale.

The male fertilises the eggs (usually numbering up to 60) very quickly and immediately takes them up into his mouth for incubation. The eggs are quite large, at approximately 2.5mm in diameter and will make the males mouth appear a little distended. It is not uncommon for the female to aggressively protect the male when he is mouthbrooding. This is another reason why it is important to give these fish adequate space. The eggs/young will remain within the mouth of the male fish for some time; indeed, the eggs usually take around 20 days to hatch (temperature dependent) and after a further 10 days, when the young are more developed and grown to approx 6-7mm, they are released. During this month-long period, the male fish will not eat and attends to the brood by regularly turning them in his mouth and expelling any that have died.

Here they may be found forming loose aggregations in the mid to upper reaches of steep drop offs, feeding on zooplankton and various marine plants and algae. Juvenile fish are mostly grey with a few bright blue spots distributed over the flanks and tail, along with blue lips. Adults are very imposing fish - they develop a convexly rounded, prominent snout (this being much less of a 'horn' than is seen in the majority of unicornfish), vertical blue lines that break up into small blue spots dorsally, in addition to a broad blue band extending from underneath the eye to the front of the rostral protuberance, and long flowing caudal streamers. Interestingly, these fish have the ability to show or hide their vivid blue markings, depending on mood. The Bignose Unicornfish is a very active, semi-aggressive acanthurid that requires a great deal of swimming space. Adults have been known to grow to almost two feet long, including the long flowing tail filaments. If you are blessed with a system of enormous proportions, the Bignose Unicornfish could make a wonderful centrepiece. The tank should contain plenty of live rock which this fish will enjoy grazing upon. Include plenty of hiding places that are large enough for the Bignose Unicornfish to retreat into quickly should it feel threatened, at the same time aiming for an aquascape that allows plenty of open swimming space along the front of the aquarium for such a powerful swimmer. Bignose Unicornfish are moderately aggressive towards tankmates, especially their own kind; for this reason it is best to house just one specimen per tank. There are good reports of this fish mixing with tangs of other genera; however it is recommended that the Bignose Unicornfish is the last addition to a set up, as it can be rather territorial to newcomers, especially similar fish species. It is best to source a medium sized specimen (i.e. over 4" in length) as they are more likely to acclimatise well to life in captivity. Conversely, extra large specimens may have a difficult time settling in, so aim for a healthy-looking fish that is neither too small nor excessively large. Avoid any specimens that appear "pinched" in the belly area, and do ask your retailer to show you that your chosen fish is feeding well prior to purchase. Bignose Unicornfish have a high metabolism and require small frequent feeds throughout the day. Powerful filtration/vigorous circulation and a high level of oxygenation are therefore essential for this energetic, voracious eater. Be sure to keep on top of water quality as this fish will not tolerate deteriorating water conditions. A large refugium with living rock can be most useful: macroalgae can be cultured on this rock and these pieces rotated with pieces from the main tank, so that the Bignose Unicornfish has a continual supply of natural foodstuffs to graze upon. Take care when handling Bignose Unicornfish, as their caudal spines (2 on each side of the caudal peduncle) are particularly large and can inflict very painful wounds. A period of quarantine can be a valuable procedure for the acclimatisation of all livestock, and it is of particular importance for the Bignose Unicornfish which can be fairly susceptible to developing marine whitespot. This can be difficult to treat in the reef aquarium.

The Birdmouth Wrasse is hardy and easy to keep, but a spacious aquarium is a necessity, as they are active, grow large, and are powerful (albeit rather jerky) swimmers. Ideally, there will also be ample rockwork to provide plenty of nooks and crannies to explore, plus an open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. A deep substrate is not required, as this species does not bury in the substrate after dark. Provide clean, well oxygenated water with areas of fast current. Tight fitting coverslides are also essential, as these fish are expert jumpers. This is a fairly boisterous wrasse that should only be kept alongside fish of similar size and temperament; smaller fish will be shown much aggression and are likely to be eaten. In the wild, the Birdmouth Wrasse snatches smaller fish in its beak and bashes them against the substrate until it breaks up into bite sized pieces. Tankmates must, therefore, be chosen with much caution. Keep only one male per tank, and, if a pair is desired, add the female and male simultaneously, or else add the female first. If two or more females are introduced to the tank (simultaneously) with no males present, one of the females will begin to change into a male. The aquarium must be of XXL proportions if such a group is to be kept successfully. Whilst the adults of this species can be readily recognised by the characteristic beak-like snout, juveniles may be more difficult to identify, as they do not develop the elongated nose until they are more mature. Like other wrasses, this species is a protogynous sequential hermaphrodite, which means that all fish are born as females and are able to change sex to male, but not back again. The largest fish in a group will be a dominant male, while the smaller fish remain female. If the dominant male dies, the largest female changes sex and takes his place. Male fish can be identified by their vivid emerald green colouration and larger size, compared to the muted browns of the female fish. The Birdmouth Wrasse (G. varius) is sometimes confused with its close relative G. caeruleus, but can be told apart by its slightly different colour pattern and geographical range; however, some experts believe the two are in fact the same species, just with geographical colour differences, but further research is needed.

Juvenile fish tend to prefer the sanctuary of protected inner reef areas, whereas the adults are habitually observed singly or in pairs (and very occasionally in large aggregations) out on the reef, feeding on algae, coral polyps, and small benthic invertebrates. This species is seldom seen in the trade and is regarded as moderately difficult to keep in the home aquarium. It is therefore recommended for advanced aquarists only. A good-sized, mature system is requisite, along with ample live rock for the fish to browse upon/hide amongst and a large open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Medium sized specimens tend to acclimatise better to aquarium life, adapting much more quickly to various prepared foods, so try to choose a healthy, alert specimen around 10cm (3.9") in length. Smaller fish may be very reluctant to feed, and larger specimens can be incredibly finicky, requiring faultless water conditions and an abundance of live food. An aquarium that has some areas of lush filamentous algae growth will also aid your new fish in settling into its new surroundings; however, as with other butterflyfish species, these fish demand excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of brisk current. Some aquarists have successfully kept the Black Butterflyfish alongside some of the more noxious soft corals, but this is something of a risk, and they should be observed carefully. Most corals and motile invertebrates will be constantly nipped at, so unfortunately are best avoided. Keep only one Black Butterflyfish per tank (unless a mated pair is acquired) and not with any other butterflyfish as they will squabble over territories.

In the wild, the Black Leopard Wrasse is known from lagoons and seaward reefs to depths of 32m (105ft). Here they may be observed in pairs or small, loose aggregations, swimming close to the substrate, whilst browsing for gastropods and foraminiferans. When approached, they move up and down in an unusual way to confuse possible predators. This leopard wrasse requires a very mature, spacious aquarium with plenty of live rock and sand that supports its natural diet on an ongoing basis, if it is to thrive. If added to a newly set up tank, it will starve to death. There should be plenty of hiding places amongst the rockwork, with enough depth of substrate (7.5cm/3" of fine sand) for the fish to bury if it feels threatened. Because of the difficulties in feeding this leopard wrasse, it should not be kept with fish that require a similar food source to survive, as otherwise one species may out-compete the other. There should be relatively calm areas in the tank that allow it to locate food successfully. Tankmates should be peaceful and of an easygoing nature so that the Black Leopard Wrasse does not feel harassed and subsequently stops venturing out to feed. Groups can sometimes be kept together successfully (added simultaneously) but larger numbers should only ever be considered for exceptionally large aquaria, as in the average sized aquarium, natural prey will deplete too quickly with that many fish requiring the same diet.

This fish is similar in appearance to the Scopas Tang (Z. scopas), and in the wild where their ranges overlap, hybrids between the two occur. The Black Tang should be provided with a generously sized tank, as ample swimming space is required, and specimens kept in smaller quarters can become quite aggressive.

Blue Spotted Jawfish make a fascinating addition to mature reef aquaria, providing that a few key requirements (including the aforementioned low water temperature) are met. These industrious bottom dwellers need a mixed substrate that is at least 10cm (3.9") deep. Ideally this will be comprised of 75% coral sand, and 25% small pieces of reef rubble (varying from approx. 0.5cm to 1.5cm in diameter). This will allow to the fish to construct a burrow, in which it will spend much time resting just inside the entrance, seemingly watching the world go by and waiting for food morsels to drift past overhead. At other times it will be busy rearranging things in and around its little tunnel, which can be very entertaining to observe. At night they sometimes close the entrance of the burrow with a larger pebble as they reverse in. The aquarium must have a tight fitting cover, as these fish will jump, and lighting should always be turned on gradually so as not to startle your fish. Their constant excavation and digging means that powerful filtration and water movement is prerequisite. Blue Spotted Jawfish may be kept in small groups if you have a vast set-up; in fact they often do better this way, but do ensure that there is adequate space for them all to construct their homes (in the wild they may live as close as 90cm to one another).

During courtship rituals, the males can undergo spectacular colour changes within seconds as they dash in and out of the rockwork, displaying intense colours and flashing their elaborate fins to attract a female. This is an excellent species for the reef aquarium as it will not harm corals or pick on desirable invertebrates. The tank should be mature and as spacious as possible (this will enable you to keep multiple specimens), with a soft sand substrate. Peaceful by nature and easily bullied, Bluestripe Flasher Wrasse should only be kept alongside passive fish of similar size and peaceable temperament or they may feel too intimidated to venture out to feed. These wrasses are best maintained in small groups with several females to every male, but all individuals must be added simultaneously or else add all females before the male/s. Keeping these fish in small aggregations will encourage natural behaviour, with the males putting on some fantastic displays with fin-flaring, as they attempt to attract a mate. Such groups will only work in spacious quarters, so if the aquarium is smaller, it is best to house a single specimen or a mated pair. Close relatives such as Fairy Wrasses and other small planktivores such as Firefish (which occupy the same niche) are best avoided. At night, these fish rest inside a mucus cocoon created in gaps in the rockwork. Ensure the tank has tight fitting covers, as flasher wrasses will jump from an open topped aquarium.

Angelfish from the Chaetodontoplus genus are not seen in the trade all that regularly, and many species are highly prized amongst serious hobbyists. The Bluestriped Angelfish, as the common name suggests, sports vivid blue horizontal stripes on a yellow to tan coloured background, and these eye-catching stripes continue onto the dorsal and anal fins. The tail, pelvic, and pectoral fins are bright yellow. As the fish matures, a dark spot encircled by blue will develop at the base of each pectoral fin. Juvenile fish differ greatly from the adults. They have a darker background colour (almost black) and flaunt a yellow curved bar just behind the eye and over the gill cover; there are yellow margins to the posterior of the dorsal and anal fins, and as the blue body stripes start to develop, these may be slightly reticulated. When first introduced to the aquarium, the Bluestriped Angelfish may be a little shy. However, the more hiding places within the tank, the more likely it will be that the angelfish will feel safe enough to swim out and about in full view whilst browsing for filamentous algae and diatoms. Caution is advised when adding this species to reef aquaria, as selected invertebrates may be nipped at; success is more likely in XXL reef systems where the fish is less likely to cause such irreparable damage, although there are absolutely no guarantees. This species is better suited to a fish-only with live rock system, which has been set up to house and meet the needs of shy, peaceful fish only. Tankmates must be chosen carefully as this fish will be reluctant to feed if there is competition from boisterous or aggressive species. Keep only one Bluestriped Angelfish per tank, and not with any other angelfish.

Juvenile fish frequent protected, shallow reef flats during the summer months, with adults swimming in deeper areas, either as solitary fish or in small aggregations of 3-15 individuals. This is an omnivorous species, feeding mostly on benthic invertebrates, especially polychaete worms, plus stony coral polyps and various algae. This somewhat shy species is regarded as moderately hardy, but is best suited to experienced aquarists. A good-sized, mature system is requisite, along with ample live rock for the fish to browse upon/hide amongst and a large open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Medium sized specimens tend to acclimatise better to aquarium life, adapting much more quickly to various prepared foods, so try to choose a healthy, alert specimen around 7.5cm (3") in length. Smaller sized fish may be very reluctant to feed, and larger specimens can sometimes be rather finicky, requiring faultless water conditions. An aquarium that has some areas of lush filamentous algae growth will also aid your new fish in settling into its new surroundings; however, as with other butterflyfish species, these fish demand excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of brisk current. Some aquarists have successfully kept the Bluestriped Butterflyfish alongside some of the more noxious soft corals, but this is something of a risk, and they should be observed carefully. Stony corals and many other sessile invertebrates will be constantly nipped at, so unfortunately must be avoided. Keep only one Bluestriped Butterflyfish per tank (unless a mated pair is acquired) and not with any other butterflyfish as they will squabble over territories. Whilst they can be rather shy when first introduced, providing them with ample retreats amongst the live rock should ensure they quickly gain confidence and venture out into the open. Tankmates should be of similar size and temperament; it is imperative that boisterous companions are avoided if this fish is to settle in and feed. The colouration and markings of the Bluestriped Butterflyfish are fairly distinctive, with well-settled individuals displaying a vibrant yellow background colour and thin blue stripes running diagonally over the body from the snout. Unusually, there is no 'mask' over the eye, a trait common in most (but not all) butterflyfish.

Juvenile Canary Blennies tend to gather in small groups, whereas the adults are solitary or seen in pairs. Meiacanthus species tend to be quite inoffensive, but they do possess two venomous canine-like teeth in the lower jaw that can be employed should they be attacked.

Whilst Canary Blennies can sometimes be a little secretive, they are generally far more self-assured than other blenniids (most likely due to the possession of such potent defensive apparatus) and will often be seen hovering about in the water column above the rockwork in an inquisitive manner. Provide the Canary Blenny with a mature tank that contains an abundance of live rock, so that it may continually graze upon it for small crustaceans; without such quantity of well-established rockwork, these fish will not fare very well. It is best to keep just one specimen per tank, unless you can acquire a known mated pair, as these fish can be a little territorial in the confines of the average aquarium.

Choat's Leopard Wrasse is known from eastern Australia, Middleton and Elizabeth Reefs, and New Caledonia. Here it is found in channels and seaward reefs, over mixed sand, rubble, and coral areas, to depths of 30m (98ft). It may occur singly, in pairs, or in large aggregations of females, and is usually observed browsing for gastropods and foraminiferans amongst the substratum. This leopard wrasse requires a very mature, spacious aquarium with plenty of live rock and sand that supports its natural diet on an ongoing basis, if it is to thrive. If added to a newly set up tank, it will starve to death. There should be plenty of hiding places amongst the rockwork, with enough depth of substrate (7.5cm/3" of fine sand) for the fish to bury if it feels threatened. Because of the difficulties in feeding this leopard wrasse, it should not be kept with fish that require a similar food source to survive, as otherwise one species may out-compete the other. There should be relatively calm areas in the tank that allow it to locate food successfully. Tankmates should be peaceful and of an easygoing nature so that your Choat's Leopard Wrasse does not feel harassed and subsequently stops venturing out to feed. Groups can sometimes be kept together successfully (added simultaneously) but larger numbers should only ever be considered for exceptionally large aquaria, as in the average sized aquarium, natural prey will deplete too quickly with that many fish requiring the same diet. Do not house with other Macropharyngodon species or pugnacious dottybacks and hawkfish, as they will fight for territory. When choosing your leopard wrasse, check that its body is not emaciated, and that it is actively searching for food. It is not uncommon for a newly added leopard wrasse to hide beneath the substrate whilst it adjusts to its new surroundings and altered circadian rhythm; in such cases it is best to leave them be, they will usually begin to explore within a couple of days. These fish require stable and optimal water conditions at all times, so a good filtration and maintenance regime is a must. Ensure that the aquarium has tight fitting coverslides with no small gaps in the hood, as these fish are expert jumpers. The colouration of juveniles and females are similar: a white body adorned with random vivid orange-red blotches (no two share the exact same pattern) and a black spot on the operculum. This black spot is edged with yellow above, and the black area can change intensity depending on the mood of the fish, sometimes changing to a greenish hue. Juvenile fish also display a small black spot on the first few dorsal fin rays. The fins of juveniles and females are almost transparent with random orange blotches on the anal fin. A terminal male, however, will display alternating horizontal stripes of white and orange along the anal fin. May also be seen on sale as Australian Leopard Wrasse or Red Leopard Wrasse.

This particular fish was formerly identified as H. ornatissimus, but is now considered a species in its own right. H. claudia is known from much of the Pacific and parts of the Indian Ocean, from French Polynesia to Australia (including the Cocos/Keeling Islands and Christmas Island) and on towards Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. H. ornatissimus is restricted to the waters around the Hawaiian Islands and Johnston Island. The two other members of this complex are H. cosmetus and H. orientalis; H. cosmetus may be found in the Western Indian Ocean and H. orientalis is a subtropical species known from the North-West Pacific. Various different meristic and morphometric measurements do aid somewhat in identification; and although H. ornatissimus shows no real differences from H. claudia in this respect, the former does attain a significantly larger size and is much more restricted in its distribution area. This article concerns H. claudia, perhaps the most colourful member of the complex. This eyecatching red and jade fish is known from outer barrier reef slopes, up to 35m (115ft) in depth, and is usually solitary. It feeds mainly on hard-shelled prey such as crustaceans, molluscs, and urchins, so it is a species that should be added to the reef tank with quite a bit of caution. Although it should not trouble corals, it will feed on a variety of invertebrates (see Reef Aquarium Compatibility section below). However, it can play a very useful role in helping to keep nuisance flatworms and pyramidellid snails (parasites of tridacnid clams) under control. The tank should be mature and furnished with plenty of living rock to provide feeding opportunities, shady hiding places and visual barriers. There should be a deep sand bed of around 3" (7.5cm) or so, in order that the wrasse may bury itself at night or if startled. Keep either a single specimen, or, if the tank is large enough, a good sized group of 5 or 6 individuals (introduced simultaneously, when young and of the same size).

These characterful fish are known from lagoons and outer reef slopes where they are afforded lifelong protection from predators and skin parasites by a host anemone. These fish are closely associated with a number of anemones, including Cryptodendrum adhaesivum, Entacmaeaquadricolor (Bubble), Heteractisaurora (Beaded), H. crispa (Sebae),H. magnifica (Ritteri), H. malu (Malu), Macrodactyla doreensis (Long Tentacle), Stichodactyla gigantea (Giant Carpet), S haddoni (Haddon's Carpet), and S. mertensii (Merten's Carpet). In the community reef aquarium, a host anemone - some of which can be a little tricky to maintain successfully incaptivity - is not necessary for your clownfish as most reef set ups contain plenty of hiding places, no large predatory fish, and sometimes cleaner shrimp/cleaner wrasse. In the absence of an anemone, some clownfish take up residence in what they see as a suitable coral substitute - which may cause them to retract in irritation as the clownfish wallow - but this isn't always the case. Many species of clownfish (including Clark's) are now captive-raised, so wherever possible the conscientious aquarist should aim to source these hardier specimens for the home aquarium, in turn helping to take pressure off the reefs. This is a colourful species, with vivid black, white and yellow stripes, though the exact pattern shows considerable geographical variation. As these fish can be somewhat territorial, keep only one pair per tank, providing them with ample space and plenty of visual barriers amongst thedÃ©cor. It is also best not to mix this species with other species of clownfish they will fight. With regards to sexing, all clownfish are born as males. A wild colony may consist of a breeding pair, which cohabits with a few-reproductive smaller male specimens. When the female dies, the dominant male will change sex and become the female.

The adult fish are often observed in open water, adjacent to steep drop-offs, whereas juveniles are much more secretive and spend most of their time in small,invertebrate-rich caves and crevices. The diet of adult fish largely consists of sea urchins, molluscs, tunicates, crabs, and other crustaceans. Despite many drawbacks (detailed below), this dramatic-looking fish is still hugely popular with aquarists. This is a species that grows quickly and requires an enormous aquarium due to its active nature and large adult size. There must also be plenty of suitable-sized shelters amongst the rockwork. The tank should be well filtered, as these fish are voracious eaters, and there should be decent current and good levels of oxygenation. Clown Triggerfish can be highly aggressive, so it is best to keep only one per tank, and not with any close relatives. Tankmates should be equally large and belligerent - this species should never be kept with invertebrates or small, passive fish. Although younger Clown Triggerfish have been known to be fairly amiable, they are notorious for being "Jekyll and Hyde" fish, abruptly turning nasty when least expected. They are quite capable of rearranging the decor, biting through pipework/heaters, and even attacking their owners, so much caution is required when arranging the decor/equipment and when carrying out maintenance on a tank containing a large ClownTriggerfish. Avoid purchasing the really tiny specimens that are sometimes seen in the trade, as these tend not to acclimatize so well to aquarium life. Instead, opt for a medium-sized specimen, and ensure it is the last addition to the tank - well-settled Clown Triggerfish do not take well to newcomers invading their territory. As the fish matures, it is likely to become quite tame with its owner and to a degree will interact through the glass. It is tempting to hand feed such a characterful pet fish, but this is not a good idea as it will be more than capable of taking a bite out of the fingers with its sharp teeth (which it uses to crush sea urchins, crabs, and other hard-shelled foods in the wild). Bear in mind that some specimens have been known to become so incredibly aggressive and territorial, that all tankmates have ended up having to be rehomed, culminating in the Clown Triggerfish being the sole resident of the tank. Nevertheless, kept alone in a spacious aquarium, the dog-like antics of the Clown Triggerfish cannot fail to please.',feeding:"Offer a wide variety of meaty foods such as Mysis shrimp, krill, cockle, prawns, mussel, squid, silversides, crab, clam meat etc. Include hard-shelled foods to help keep the teeth worn down.

In the wild, clownfish are afforded lifelong protection from predators and skin parasites by a host anemone; Common Clownfish being most commonly associated with the Ritteri anemone (Heteractis magnifica), Stichodactyla gigantea, and S. mertensii. In the community reef aquarium, a host anemone - some of which can be a little tricky to maintain successfully in captivity - is not necessary for your clownfish as most reef set ups contain plenty of hiding places, no large predatory fish, and sometimes cleaner shrimp/cleaner wrasse. In the absence of an anemone, some clownfish take up residence in what they see as a suitable coral substitute - which may cause them to retract in irritation as the clownfish wallow - but this isn't always the case. Many species of clownfish (including the Common) are now captive-raised, so wherever possible the conscientious aquarist should aim to source these hardier specimens for the home aquarium, in turn helping to take pressure off the reefs. As these fish can be quite territorial, in the average sized aquarium you should aim to keep just one known pair. In XXL aquaria, more than one pair could be kept if they are all added at the same time as juvenile specimens and plenty of visual barriers are provided amongst the decor (or in the case of adding host anemones, enough anemones for all the fish, added at the same time as the clowns). If shelters are limited, the dominant clownfish will bully the others, picking them off one-by-one, so careful observation is necessary. Bear in mind that catching fish out of an established reef tank can be extremely difficult, so think carefully about adding more than one pair to your set up! It is also best not to mix this species with other species of clownfish as many will fight. With regards to sexing, all clownfish are born as males. A wild colony may consist of a breeding pair, which cohabit with a few non-reproductive smaller male specimens. When the female dies, the dominant male will change sex and become the female. This is known as protandrous sequential hermaphroditism. In the case of two juvenile specimens in the home aquarium, the larger of the two will become the female. Finally, do not attempt to house Common Clownfish with the Atlantic Carpet anemone (Condylactis sp.) as they may be consumed, and be aware that these fish are very sensitive to treatment with copper remedies. A tank-raised black and white colour variant of this species is often also available.

Numerous eggs (numbering between several hundred to a few thousand) will be deposited and the male will aerate them by fanning them with his pectoral fins whilst the female guards them against predators. The eggs will hatch in darkness after 7-10 days, and once free-swimming, the planktonic fry are left to fend for themselves and should be fed on suitably tiny foodstuffs such as live rotifers, moving on to baby brineshrimp after a few days.

As they are superb diggers, do ensure that all rockwork is secure and cannot be undermined by their extensive tunnel digging; one way of doing this is to forward plan for these fish and place your rockwork before adding substrate to the tank. Peaceful in nature, Convict Blennies should get on with most other fish in the aquarium, provided that they are not small enough to be regarded as "bite size" and not overly aggressive. Concerning invertebrate compatibility, larger specimens will prey on ornamental shrimp, worms, and crustaceans, and it is wise to place corals off the bottom of the aquarium so that they do not become accidentally buried with sand during the Convict Blenny's digging activity. This burrowing behaviour is fascinating to observe and can be very beneficial in keeping the substrate turned over. Convict Blennies are "scale-less" and as such do not tolerate chemical treatments very well at all. It is best to keep on top of water quality to ensure that these aren't necessary.

The Crosshatch Triggerfish is one of the few triggerfish species that can be safely kept in most reef aquaria. Sessile invertebrates are typically ignored, but it must be mentioned that larger Crosshatch Triggerfish are likely to eat any ornamental shrimp they come across.

In the wild, adult fish form large aggregations amongst rocky coral reefs; the juveniles often commensal with large anemones, small coral heads, and sea urchins.
Cheap and extremely hardy, juvenile Dominoes are very attractive and reef-friendly, but grow into extremely aggressive fish that are likely to terrorise their tankmates. As with all damsels other than clownfish, dominant fish become male. Social groupings consist of a single territorial male, one or more females and unsexed juvenile fish. In the aquarium a stable group can be created, ideally by mixing individuals of different sizes that duplicate this natural order, or allowing sufficient space for weaker fish to escape serious harassment until a dominant individual develops. Any new humbugs added should be significantly smaller than established ones, duplicating the recruitment of juveniles from the plankton. Expect the male to defend a spawning site vigorously from all intruders apart from females ready to spawn.
  Their aquarium should be spacious and include plenty of rockwork to break sightlines and create hiding spots; try to aquascape it in such a way as to create several visual barriers as this will help to minimise aggression levels. Although hardy, good filtration is a must and decent water movement will be appreciated. Peaceful tankmates are likely to be killed in all but the largest aquaria.
Dominoes are an active, interesting species to keep but do need to be kept in a stocking scheme that is well thought out beforehand. Removing them from a well-furnished tank will be extremely difficult at a later stage and adding any new fishes can be extremely challenging. It's true to say that many keepers regret adding these long-lived fish to their aquarium as their hobby develops and the frustrations of being unable to add new fish sink in. Sadly, as these fish mature, the colour and pattern becomes somewhat drab, with the white markings much less apparent (sometimes to a point where they can't even be seen) and the black body colour takes on much more of a steely grey appearance with dark scale margins.

These fish sometimes occur singly but adults are more commonly seen in pairs that share sandy burrows. These fascinating bottom dwellers are said to mimic crabs as they hop about with their two eyespot-clad dorsal fins held erect and the black pelvic and anal fins appearing like pincers underneath them. Another school of thought suggests that the lateral view of the fish mimics the face of a large, carnivorous fish, which would make much more sense as a defence mechanism. Either way, it only takes a split second for the large ocelli to confuse a predator. Eyespot Gobies are most often observed filter feeding from the fine substrate, sifting out tiny interstitial invertebrates from the sand. They should only ever be added to a well-established reef tank, where there will be plenty of live rock and live substrate that supports their natural diet. This species will spend many hours searching out the miniscule invertebrates living amongst the substrate. It absolutely must be provided with an ongoing source of natural prey and the best way to ensure a continuous supply of tiny live foods is by culturing them in an attached fishless refugium. If added to a newly set up tank, these fish will simply starve to death. There should be plenty of hiding places amongst the rockwork, with enough depth of fine substrate and small rubble pieces or shell fragments for the fish to construct a burrow. Because of the challenges in feeding Eyespot Gobies, they should not be kept with fish that require a similar food source to survive (e.g. Mandarins), as otherwise one species may out-compete the other. There should be relatively calm areas in the tank that allow the gobies to locate food successfully. Tankmates should be peaceful and of an easygoing nature so that the Eyespot Gobies do not feel harassed and subsequently stop venturing out to feed. Avoid housing with ornamental shrimp, as these are likely to become a snack. It is best to keep these fish as a known mated pair as single specimens are known to fare rather poorly in the aquarium. Two males placed together in close quarters will fight, so it is best to ensure that the fish you have are compatible (and not just two fish randomly paired up) and offer them enough space and visual barriers.

Ensure that food offered reaches the bottom of the tank, where the gobies will ingest it as they take in mouthfuls of substrate to sift. If food does not reach the bottom of the aquarium on a regular basis due to aggressive feeders in the same tank, the gobies are likely to become malnourished. Offer small amounts of food several times per day, target feeding if necessary. Before purchasing, please be aware that this species must be provided with natural prey (non-live foods rarely sustain them for any great length of time), and a constant supply of tiny foods for this purpose could be cultured in a fishless refugium.

Whilst many of the Fang or Sabre-ToothedBlennies are known to parasitize other fish, those from the Meiacanthus genus (of which 28 species have been formerly described) feed only on zooplankton as they hover in the water column, and on tiny benthic invertebrates they find on the reef. JuvenileForktail Fang Blennies tend to gather in small groups, whereas the adults are solitary or seen in pairs. These pretty blue and yellow blennies are distinguished from others of the same genus by the blue-edged diagonal black line extending from the eye, yellow dorsal fin, and deeply forked caudal fin. Meiacanthus species tend to be quite inoffensive, but they do possess two venomous canine-like teeth in the lower jaw that can be employed should they be attacked. Most fish know to leave them alone, but if they are ingested, a quick, sharp bite on the inside of the predator's mouth from the blenny ensures that it is spat out again " and it is usually none the worse for wear. These fish do not employ their weaponry in an active manner, instead, they use it only as a last resort to defend themselves or their territory. Other fish such as the Bicolour Blenny (Ecsenius bicolor)and the Bicolour Fang Blenny Mimic (Plagiotremuslaudanus) have evolved to mimic this species in order to afford themselves protection from predators, even though they do not possess the same effective dentition-deterrent as the Meiacanthus species. Whilst Forktail Fang Blennies can sometimes be a little secretive, they are generally far more self-assured than other blenniids (most likely due to the possession of such potent defensive apparatus) and will often be seen hovering about in the water column above the rockwork in an inquisitive manner. Provide the Forktail Fang Blenny with a mature tank that contains an abundance of liverock, so that it may continually graze upon it for small crustaceans; without such quantity of well-established rockwork, these fish will not fare very well.

Cheap and extremely hardy, juvenile Humbugs are very attractive and reef-friendly, but grow into extremely aggressive fish that are likely to terrorise their tankmates. As with all damsels other than clownfish, dominant fish become male. Social groupings consist of a single territorial male, one or more females and unsexed juvenile fish. In the aquarium a stable group can be created, ideally by mixing individuals of different sizes that duplicate this natural order, or allowing sufficient space for weaker fish to escape serious harassment until a dominant individual develops. Any new humbugs added should be significantly smaller than established ones, duplicating the recruitment of juveniles from the plankton. Expect the male to defend a spawning site vigorously from all intruders apart from females ready to spawn.
  Their aquarium should be spacious and include plenty of rockwork to break sightlines and create hiding spots; try to aquascape it in such a way as to create several visual barriers as this will help to minimise aggression levels. Although hardy, good filtration is a must and decent water movement will be appreciated. Peaceful tankmates are likely to be killed in all but the largest aquaria.
Humbugs are an active, interesting species to keep but do need to be kept in a stocking scheme that is well thought out beforehand. Removing them from a well-furnished tank will be extremely difficult at a later stage and adding any new fishes can be extremely challenging.

A good-sized, mature system is requisite, along with ample live rock for the fish to browse upon/hide amongst and a large open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Medium sized specimens tend to acclimatise better to aquarium life, adapting much more quickly to various prepared foods, so try to choose a healthy, alert specimen around 9cm (3.5") in length. Smaller sized fish may be very reluctant to feed, and larger specimens can sometimes be rather finicky, requiring faultless water conditions. An aquarium that has some areas of lush filamentous algae growth will also aid your new fish in settling into its new surroundings; however, as with other butterflyfish species, these fish demand excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of brisk current. Some aquarists have successfully kept the Fourspot Butterflyfish alongside some of the more noxious soft corals, but this is something of a risk, and they should be observed carefully. Stony corals and many other sessile invertebrates will be constantly nipped at, so unfortunately must be avoided. Keep only one Fourspot Butterflyfish per tank (unless a mated pair is acquired) and not with any other butterflyfish as they will squabble over territories.

This somewhat shy species is a member of the venomous rabbitfish family, and is very similar in appearance to the One-Spot Fox Face (S. unimaculatus) but lacks the large dark spot on the posterior of each flank. You may often see juveniles kept together in large shoals without problems in your local aquatics store, but be aware that as the fish mature, they become intolerant of their own kind within the confines of the aquarium and should be kept singly, with the exception of a bonded male-female pair. Unrelated fish species will be ignored, most giving the Foxface a wide berth because of the venomous spines on their dorsal and anal fins. Needless to say, this is a fish that must be handled with much care when catching and acclimatising; ideally it should be gently herded into a submerged fish-bag or solid container, rather than risk using a net to lift it from the water. The fish is likely to erect its fins, entangling the sturdy spines in the netting, and at the same time there is the chance of the aquarist receiving a very painful sting. The tank itself should offer plenty of dark hiding places amongst rockwork, and employ decent filtration and circulation. If adding this species to a reef aquarium, be aware that occasional specimens do have a taste for coral polyps, particularly those that are hungry, so be sure to observe carefully and ensure the fish is receiving enough food.

Gold Neon Gobies are regularly observed servicing fish that have ectoparasites, helping to control diseases such as Lymphocystis and marine whitespot. An advantage over most other cleaner fishes is that the Gold Neon Goby is not an "˜obligate cleaner"™ (i.e. it does not rely on cleaning/eating parasites for optimal health).

Large groups (7+) can be kept if the system is spacious; however in smaller aquaria it is advisable to keep either a single specimen or a known mated pair. Although these gobies cannot be sexed externally, it is often fairly easy to pick out a compatible pair at your local aquarium store as they may have paired off and be resting very close to one another. With regards to compatibility, Gold Neon Gobies are ideal for community reef aquaria; they are also often purported to coexist with a number of unlikely large predators, which usually tend to leave the gobies alone on account of their known cleaning services.

As their planktonic prey is swept to them in these areas of brisk water movement, they can be relaxed about resources and enjoy protection from predators amongst the branching coral thickets. This makes them amongst the most peaceful of the notorious damselfish family.
  Being a relatively peaceful social species, Chromis should be kept in groups of 6 or more. These active fish spend a lot of time out in the water column, in turn acting as "dither fish", encouraging more reclusive species out into the open and encouraging other plankton feeders to try a range of prepared diets that more finicky fishes may not recognise as food. Single specimens may pine away in the corners of the tank or become harassed by other tankmates; indeed, keeping this sociable species in this way could be considered cruel. As with any damselfish, groups are most stable when a single larger dominant fish is added alongside smaller specimens - this larger fish will rapidly become a territorial dominant male, even if this means a change of current gender. This mimics the situation seen in nature and stops individuals fighting over the top spot. Multiple males can coexist in large set ups if numbers are high and each has access to a spawning territory.

Here this coral-commensal goby is found singly or in pairs, amongst branches of Acropora. These fish are characterised by a green body colour with red to violet stripes, broken lines, or rows of spots on the flanks, 4-5 reddish bars on head, and an absence of scales. The modified ventral fins have fused to form a kind of suction cup that helps them to maintain position on coral branches in swift currents. Green Coral Gobies are generally of a peaceful nature and make a wonderful addition to mature reef aquaria containing established colonies of broad-branching SPS corals, which they very much enjoy hiding amongst. Although often recommended for nano aquaria because of its diminutive size, caution should be exercised for two reasons. Firstly, smaller tanks will limit the number of individuals you can keep together; only one specimen is recommended in small nano type tanks, otherwise there will be constant arguments over territory which could result in the untimely demise of the weaker individual. Secondly, the more space available in a reef setting, the chances are that there will be much larger, stable colonies of suitable SPS corals available, and so it is less likely that these fish will damage any one individual beyond repair as they go about their daily routines (hiding/resting amongst the branches, and feeding on the occasional mucous polyp). If these types of corals are not being cultivated in your aquarium, invest in several coral skeletons so that these fish have something natural to interact with and give them a sense of security. Green Coral Gobies may be kept in groups (but only in larger quarters where there is an abundance of hiding places/territories), and oftentimes these fish will pair up and spawn. With regards to tankmates, these should all be small, non-aggressive feeders. These gobies actually produce a thick toxic body slime that deters many species from trying to consume them. Having said that, obviously do not house these fish with large carnivores. In the wild, these gobies are most commonly associated with Acropora nasuta, but they are also known to inhabit the branches of A. millepora and A. valida, and sometimes A. tenuis.

These fish are bi-directional protogynous hermaphrodites (which is sometimes referred to as a bi-directional sex change), which is an uncommon trait among gobies, meaning that any two fish placed together are guaranteed to form a male-female pair. These fish tend to strip a small area of coral polyps in order to create a place to deposit their eggs, although other sites are not unheard of. The male fish will dance/quiver in front of the female and when she is ready to spawn, she will deposit her eggs on the coral branch, and these are immediately fertilised and subsequently guarded by the male. The eggs are very small (less than 1mm in diameter) and can number several hundred. The presence of the eggs on the coral may cause a small amount of tissue recession in that area, but this should recover quickly once the eggs have hatched (4-5 days, dependent on water temperature).

This species is an ideal candidate for the mature reef aquarium; it is colourful, relatively peaceful, and readily acclimatises to aquarium life.

Helfrich"s Firefish will rarely become aggressive towards other fish species (except close relatives), but it can be very territorial with its own kind, and they will fight fiercely unless they are a mated pair. For this reason it is best to either keep a single specimen (particularly in smaller, "˜nano" aquaria) or acquire a known mated pair. These fish cannot be easily sexed externally and simply putting two specimens together and hoping for the best is unlikely to work, although adding a group to a large aquarium will usually result in harmonious pairing, with 'spare' fish being removed if they become victims of aggression.

They are best kept in a compatible male-female pair (your supplier may be able to source you a mated pair) but be sure not to simply place two individuals together from different sources, as if it turns out that they are both males, they will fight - especially in smaller aquaria. The tank should be furnished with plenty of live rock and a reasonable depth of sandy substrate (~10cm/4"), with a good selection of small rubble pieces that vary in size (not too big to be moved), from which a burrow can be created. Tankmates should be small and peaceful, as pugnacious species will intimidate these diminutive bottom dwellers and prevent them from feeding. As with other members of the same genus, this goby forms a symbiotic partnership with an almost blind alpheid shrimp; together they share the safety of a burrow which the shrimp digs/maintains, and the goby keeps watch for predators. Whilst the shrimp is working, it maintains antennal contact with its goby partner posted at the entrance of the shared burrow. If the shrimp detects the quivering motion of the goby's caudal fin during an unusual situation, it reacts by immediately withdrawing into the depths of the burrow, hastily followed by the goby. The entrance to the shared burrow will be closed at night, and only one entrance is usually open at any one time. The shrimp will only emerge from the burrow whilst it can have tactile contact with the goby. A shrimp partner is not strictly necessary, but if they can be acquired together, they will make such a fascinating display, captivating the observer for hours on end. The usual shrimp that partners the Hi-fin Clown Goby is the Red and White Barred Shrimp Alpheus randalli. Your dealer may be able to acquire the two together, it is certainly worth asking. Ensure that the tank has tight fitting coverslides as Hi-fin Clown Gobies have been know n to jump from open-topped aquaria. For many years, this highly sought-after fish was known simply as "Stonogobiops sp." until its formal description in 2001. The latin name "yasha" is in reference to a traditional Japanese female devil; alluding to the large prevomerine teeth of this goby.

Just prior to spawning, the belly of the female fish will become noticeably swollen when full of eggs. Spawning occurs inside the cave or under a rock, where an egg mass will be deposited/fertilised. The eggs should hatch within 5-6 days (temperature dependent) and it is believed that the larvae take around a month to undergo metamorphosis."},{name:"Hi-fin Flasher Wrasse",link:"https://www.fishkeeper.co.uk/fish/marine/wrasses/hi-fin-flasher-wrasse",overview:{Synonyms:"None",Distribution:"Indo-Pacific",MaximumSize:'15cm (5.9")',Temperature:"Tropical: 24-28°C",WaterParameters:"SG: 1.020-1.025, pH: 8.1-8.4",Compatibility:"Reef",Lighting:"No special requirements","Reef Aquarium Compatibility":"Excellent","Sexual Dimorphism":"Protogynous hermaphrodites.

Here, these beautiful fish may be observed in small harems as they feed on zooplankton in the water column. Juvenile fish are orange, fading lighter ventrally, and have bright red eyes. As they mature, the body colour intensifies to a rich red-orange, again lighter ventrally, and a series of broken red horizontal stripes start to appear across the flanks. Females remain relatively subdued in colour, with the dominant males much more vibrant in comparison - the horizontal lines on the flanks becoming a bright mixture of red/blue/purple, and the dorsal and anal fins are much larger than those of the females. The dorsal fin of dominant males is quite magnificent, developing 5-7 long filaments, the fin itself adorned with bright red, yellow, or neon blue highlights. The lunate caudal fin of the male is tinged with neon blue/purple, and develops long filaments at the tips. During courtship rituals, the males can undergo spectacular colour changes within seconds as they dash in and out of the rockwork, displaying intense colours and flashing their elaborate fins to attract a female. This is an excellent species for the reef aquarium as it will not harm corals or pick on desirable invertebrates. The tank should be mature and as spacious as possible (this will enable you to keep multiple specimens), with a soft sand substrate. Peaceful by nature and easily bullied, Hi-fin Flasher Wrasse should only be kept alongside passive fish of similar size and peaceable temperament or they may feel too intimidated to venture out to feed. These wrasses are best maintained in small groups with several females to every male, but all individuals must be added simultaneously or else add all females before the male/s. Keeping these fish in small aggregations will encourage natural behaviour, with the males putting on some fantastic displays with fin-flaring, as they attempt to attract a mate. Such groups will only work in spacious quarters, so if the aquarium is smaller, it is best to house a single specimen or a mated pair. Close relatives such as Fairy Wrasses and other small planktivores such as Firefish (which occupy the same niche) are best avoided.

Here these fish have been observed forming small aggregations of up to 5 individuals at steep outer reef drop offs and areas of black coral and sea fan growths. This small-sized butterflyfish is one of a complex of several similar looking fish and is only sporadically seen in the aquarium trade. This species is regarded as moderately difficult, and is therefore recommended for advanced aquarists only. A good-sized, mature system is requisite, along with ample live rock for the fish to browse upon/hide amongst and a large open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Water temperature should be lower than average on account of these fish hailing from deeper, slightly cooler waters (typically 22-80m/72-263ft). Medium sized specimens tend to acclimatise better to aquarium life, adapting much more quickly to various prepared foods, so try and choose a healthy, alert specimen around 7cm (2.8") in length. Smaller sized fish may be reluctant to feed, and larger specimens can sometimes be rather finicky, requiring faultless water conditions. An aquarium that has some areas of lush filamentous algae growth will also aid your new fish in settling into its new surroundings; however, as with other butterflyfish species, these fish demand excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of brisk current. Some aquarists have successfully kept the Indian Butterflyfish alongside some of the more noxious soft corals, but this is something of a risk, and they should be observed carefully. Stony corals and many other sessile invertebrates will be constantly nipped at, so unfortunately must be avoided. Keep only one Indian Butterflyfish per tank (unless a mated pair is acquired) and not with any other butterflyfish as they will squabble over territories. Whilst they can be a little shy when first introduced, providing them with ample retreats amongst the live rock will ensure they quickly gain confidence and venture out into the open. Once settled, these intelligent, peaceful fish actually become very assertive feeders, competing with most other fish species, and they will also be most curious of any activity in and around their aquarium. Tankmates should be of similar size and temperament.

This small triggerfish is known only from Kiritimati (Christmas Island) in the Line Islands chain in the Central Pacific. These islands are an expansive collection of breathtakingly beautiful low-lying atolls with partially or fully enclosed lagoons and coral islands with surrounding reefs. At Kiritimati, this triggerfish has been most frequently observed inhabiting a fairly deep zone between 90-100m (296-328ft), below a significant thermocline at around 85m (279ft). The water in the area above the thermocline measured 25-28 °C (typical reef temperatures), and was 20-22 °C below. No X. greenei were observed above the thermocline, but it proved to be a common species in the region below. The habitat itself consists of a gently sloping hard substratum with patches of rocks, coral rubble, and small boltholes. Below 100m, this gives way to a vertical drop-off and another thermocline (the temperature measuring 10-14 °C below this) and no X. greenei were observed in this area. The Kiri Triggerfish is one of the few triggerfish species that can be safely kept in most reef aquaria. Sessile invertebrates are typically ignored, but it must be mentioned that larger Kiri Triggerfish are likely to eat any ornamental shrimp they come across. These fish are therefore ideal for those spacious reef set ups without any crustaceans. Kiri Triggerfish can be kept in a mated pair, or even in groups if introduced simultaneously. Filtration should be efficient and the water well oxygenated with areas of brisk current. Although this species may be a little shy when first introduced to the aquarium, the fish will soon gain confidence and may even spit water at the surface in anticipation of feeding time. Tankmates should be chosen with care as Kiri Triggerfish, whilst not anywhere near as belligerent as other members of the family, can still be moderately aggressive. Tiny, placid fish should be avoided. As with all fish, personalities can differ and there are occasional reports of "rogue fish". The vast majority of specimens will be safe in a reef environment, but we advise that you observe your individual fish carefully. As these triggerfish are often found at reasonable depths, the water temperature should be kept below 24 °C, and introduction to brighter lighting should be carried out gradually. The six known species of Xanthichthys triggerfish can be split into two groups, according to the number of pigmented cheek grooves, either 3 or 5. X. greenei, like the similar-looking X. lineopunctatus from the Western Indian Ocean, and X. ringens from the Western Atlantic, all have 3 (vs. 5 in X. auromarginatus, X. caeruleolineatus, and X. mento). The colour of X. greenei, X. lineopunctatus, and X. ringens is almost identical; however, X. greenei has a lower body scale count, body spots are reduced to a few speckles dorsally, and it attains a much smaller standard length (15.4cm vs 25/26cm).',feeding:"Meaty frozen foods such as vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, Spirulina-enriched brineshrimp, Mysis shrimp, chopped krill/squid/cockle/mussel.

Adults are usually found in pairs, feeding near the substrate on various small crustaceans, but some specimens have been found in open water, attached to drifting Sargassum some 20km (12.4miles) from the shore. Most specimens seen in the aquatics trade will have been captive bred, the majority by the Tropical Marine Centre (TMC). This helps to take pressure off of the wild populations, currently listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species and CITES II listed. Interestingly, the common Seahorse has two main colour phases: black and yellow. The black form can be grey to black with a somewhat grainy-looking appearance, and the yellow form may be cream, yellow, or golden, with fairly large dark spots (especially in the females) and a black line running from their chest to their abdomen. The golden phase seahorses are capable of dramatic colour change, depending on their surroundings, mood, or stress, and they may take on an olive appearance when first adjusting to their new home. Other variable colour forms are far less common, but some individuals may show a mixture of black and yellow. Instead of scales, all seahorses have a layer of skin that is stretched over bony plates, visible as a series of rings around the trunk. The eyes can move independently of one another, and locomotion is powered by rapidly oscillating the dorsal fin, whilststeering with the pectorals. In this species, the coronet is typically of a low to medium height and rounded, sometimes with a cup-like depression in the top, and with a noticeable overhang at the back. The skin is not particularly spiny in this species, instead, there are low, rounded bumps, and 11 conspicuous trunk rings (plus 34-38 tail rings). In order for seahorses to thrive in captivity, they are best maintained in mature species-only aquaria, where they will not be subjected to boisterous companions and outcompeted for food. Ideally, the aquarium will provide plenty of stationary branching decor which they can grab onto with their amazing prehensile tails e.g. gorgonian skeletons, plastic plants, orlive marine greenery. As they are masters of camouflage, providing areas of golden-hueddÃ©cor is known to encourage gold phase specimens to take on their most intense colours. Water flow should be gentle so that these poor swimmers are not blown into solid surfaces; gentle current also having the added benefit of increasing their chances of finding plenty of food items. As steady feedings are required,regular partial water changes are essential (be very careful in matching the temperature and salinity of the new water to that which you have taken from the tank). The use of a small protein skimmer can be very beneficial. In addition to the requisite branching decor as mentioned above, a live sand bed plus some live rock will help to culture various prey items such as amphipods and isopods, which the seahorses can browse upon in between the times when the aquarist adds food to the tank. Many find that an adjacent refugium is extremely beneficial in keeping a constant supply of live food available to their seahorses. Before purchase, ensure that the seahorses are in good health and are feeding well (ask the shop to demonstrate). When seahorses are to be taken from an aquarium i.e. when purchasing or if moving them to different quarters, always ensure that they are herded into a suitable container or bag under the water; if they are lifted free from the water, they may well ingest air which can cause them problems. Likewise, many species can all too easily become entangled in nets and then subsequently damaged when trying to free them. The herding under technique really is the kindest method of capture. Please plan your seahorse aquarium carefully and responsibly - the primary lack of success in keeping syngnathids in captivity is starvation, which is so easily avoided. To reiterate: (1) provide a mature, stable, and gentle, "non-competitive" environment with appropriate decor, (2) ensure that there is an ongoing supply of various nutritious foods via very regular feedings, living sand/rock, and a fishless refugium, and (3) choose healthy captive-bred livestock that is provento be feeding well, and is bagged for you without exposure to air.

regularly captive-bred for the trade, taking pressure off the vulnerable wild
populations; it has also been bred in the home aquarium. This species is
monogamous, and prior to breeding, the couple will begin an elaborate courtship
ritual where the male dances around the female, whilst changing colour and
producing clicking sounds. After a time, the pair will entwine their tails and
float together over the substrate. They will then turn belly to belly and the
female will insert her ovipositor into the males brood pouch (which is located
on his belly, under the tail) and lays her eggs. The male then fertilises the
eggs, which subsequently become embedded into the walls of the pouch. The brood
size is quite variable, depending on the age and size of the parents, but will
typically number around 200-300 on average. The courtship ritual will then
continue for some time, even after the male has become pregnant. Some 20-28
days later, the male goes into labour (usually at night), and this can be quite
a strenuous task that involves much thrusting, sometimes over the course of
several hours, until all of the young seahorses are released. There is no
parental care, the pelagic young are fully independent and fend for themselves,
usually attaching themselves to decor or greenery near the surface. They measure
around 7mm/0.28" when born, and can be fed baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) straight away. It may

These benthic fish are usually solitary, but are sometimes seen in pairs, or small groups.

Juvenile fish (which sport a large, distinctive black ocellus edged in blue on each flank) are very secretive and stay close to the safety of corals and small crevices, whereas adults venture further afield.
The Lemonpeel Angelfish requires a mature aquarium with plenty of rockwork, on which it can graze for the microalgae, and in which it can hide. This vibrantly-coloured fish is rather notorious for picking on zoanthids and LPS corals (see Reef Aquarium Compatibility below) so caution is advised when adding to a reef set up; the larger the tank, the better, as the fish is then less likely to continually pick at any particular sessile invertebrate and cause irreparable damage. A frequent, varied feeding regime will also help in this respect.
Like most other members of the Centropyge genus, the Lemonpeel Angelfish does not grow very large, but nevertheless, it is an active species which requires plenty of space. The least problematic combinations of fish come from mixing them with dissimilar tank mates and combining them with other dwarf angels can be problematic unless certain measures are taken. As they're protogynous, all young individuals are potentially female, and animals of equal size are likely to clash over hierarchy with dominant individuals becoming male. For this reason, it's best to keep them singly or in pairs or groups where a significant size difference makes dominance straightforward with minimal fighting. This also applies when attempting to house different species of Centropyge together and generally speaking, it's always best to add smaller individuals to established ones. This mimics the natural state where young fish settle out the plankton and into existing communities of territorial fishes. The greater the difference in size, the less aggression will be displayed although solitary fish will often be overstimulated if they've been kept alone for an extended period. Ritualised display postures appease aggression in the more dominant fish, but close supervision may be needed and keeping multiple dwarf angels is best attempted in large aquaria with plenty of rockwork. Buying existing pairs or groups is easier, as the stressful first date scenario can be avoided.
Natural hybrids of this fish and the Half-black Angelfish (C. vrolikii) are sometimes available. Interestingly, the Lemonpeel Angelfish is mimicked by juvenile Acanthurus pyroferus tangs, who probably benefit from the large spines below the gill covers that predators know are a feature of dwarf angels. As the surgeonfish develops its own blades for defence, this protective deception is no longer needed by adults.`,feeding:"This species requires more algae and seaweed in its diet compared to other dwarf angelfish.

This leopard wrasse requires a very mature, spacious aquarium with plenty of live rock and sand that supports its natural diet on an ongoing basis, if it is to thrive. If added to a newly set up tank, it will starve to death. There should be plenty of hiding places amongst the rockwork, with enough depth of substrate (7.5cm/3" of fine sand) for the fish to bury if it feels threatened. Because of the difficulties in feeding this leopard wrasse, it should not be kept with fish that require a similar food source to survive, as otherwise one species may out-compete the other. There should be relatively calm areas in the tank that allow it to locate food successfully. Tankmates should be peaceful and of an easygoing nature so that the Leopard Wrasse does not feel harassed and subsequently stops venturing out to feed. Groups can sometimes be kept together successfully (added simultaneously) but larger numbers should only ever be considered for exceptionally large aquaria, as in the average sized aquarium, natural prey will deplete too quickly with that many fish requiring the same diet.

These nervous fish require plenty of open swimming and foraging space, ample hiding places, a substrate that is not too sharp, and non-aggressive tankmates that are larger than the goatfish (which will predate on fish small enough to fit in their mouths). Tight fitting coverslides on the tank are also an absolute must, as these fish are expert jumpers. Powerful filtration and protein skimming are essential as these active fish have a high metabolism and require small feedings several times per day. Most goatfishes will habitually grub through the substrate with their two impressive unbranched sensory chin barbels, so it is inevitable that a fair amount of debris will be stirred up into the system whenever it disturbs the substrate, hence the importance of decent filtration.

This is a delicate species that is really only suitable for advanced aquarists with mature, dimly-lit, deepwater tanks. In the confines of the home aquarium, it is best to keep either a solitary specimen, or else a group comprising of a single male and at least 8 females. Unfortunately, smaller groups will result in squabbles, where the weakest fish is likely to be picked on and prevented from feeding, eventually succumbing to being bullied by the others. These large shoals should only be considered if the tank is of XXL proportions " if the tank is of average size, it really is best to house a single specimen only. Longfin Anthias are relatively peaceable and somewhat shy. They should not be housed with direct food competitors or with docile species such as firefish. Conversely, ensure that their tankmates are not overly large, belligerent species either, or the Longfin Anthias will feel intimidated. Longfin Anthias are usually perfectly safe in a mature deep reef set up, typically swimming out and about in the open water areas and ignoring sessile invertebrates. It is essential that illumination is kept subdued if these fish are going to acclimatise successfully though; the bright lighting of a typical shallow-water reef is cited as one of the key reasons for these fish not adjusting well to life in the home aquarium. Provide plenty of shady crevices and overhangs amongst the rockwork, ensuring all structures are stable. Likewise, the temperature of the tank water is also crucial: as these fish inhabit deepwater drop-offs where they are often exposed to an upwelling of colder currents, the aquarium water temperature should not be allowed to rise above 25 °C (77 deg F), so a means of chilling the water may be necessary during hot summer months. A varied diet is a must to keep the fish in good health and for them to display their vibrant colouration. Ideally they will be fed small amounts several times per day (see below). An attached refugium cultivating copepods and amphipods can also really help to provide a steady, ongoing supply of nutritious live food to keep this active planktivore content. Powerful filtration and protein skimming, plus a good maintenance regime are essential for maintaining optimal water quality despite the heavy nutrient input.

This species sports spectacular red colouration along the dorsal fin, most noticeable when its fins are held erect. In the wild, the Red Foxface inhabits coral reefs, where it feeds upon algae and tiny invertebrates. Juvenile specimens tend to be very secretive and hide amongst the corals, whereas larger adults are often observed swimming in pairs. The aquarium should have powerful filtration and circulation, and should offer plenty of dark hiding places amongst the rockwork. If adding this species to a reef aquarium, be aware that occasional specimens do have a taste for certain coral polyps, particularly those that are feeling hungry, so be sure to observe carefully and ensure the fish is receiving enough food. The Red Foxface has a small mouth that is specially adapted for browsing on algae (the main constituent of its diet) and will consume both undesirable and desirable algae species. They must receive regular offerings of greenfoods in their diet, otherwise they will fade in colour and their health will deteriorate. Meaty foods can be offered, and indeed will be accepted, but it is very important that rabbitfish receive a decent amount of algae-based foodstuffs as part of their daily nourishment. Red Foxfaces tend to be intolerant of their own kind within the confines of the aquarium and are best kept singly, with the exception of a bonded male-female pair. Unrelated fish species will be ignored, most giving the Red Foxface a wide berth because of the venomous spines on its dorsal and anal fins. Needless to say, this is a fish that must be handled with much care when catching and acclimatising; ideally it should be gently herded into a submerged fish-bag or solid container, rather than risk using a net to lift it from the water. The fish is likely to erect its fins, entangling the sturdy spines in the netting, and at the same time there is the chance of the aquarist receiving a very painful sting. This species is capable of changing colour to a blotchy "fright pattern" at the blink of an eye. This can be due to a sudden shock (e.g. someone coming into the room where the aquarium is situated), an altercation with another fish, lights coming on too suddenly etc. Ideally the tank should be situated away from high areas of foot traffic.

This species is regarded as moderately difficult, and is therefore recommended for advanced aquarists only. A good-sized, mature system is requisite, along with ample live rock for the fish to browse upon/hide amongst and a large open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Water temperature should be lower than average on account of these fish hailing from deeper, slightly cooler waters (typically 20-80m/66-263ft). Medium sized specimens tend to acclimatise better to aquarium life, adapting much more quickly to various prepared foods, so try and choose a healthy, alert specimen around 7cm (2.8") in length. Smaller sized fish may be reluctant to feed, and larger specimens can sometimes be rather finicky, requiring faultless water conditions. An aquarium that has some areas of lush filamentous algae growth will also aid your new fish in settling into its new surroundings; however, as with other butterflyfish species, these fish demand excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of brisk current. Some aquarists have successfully kept the Marquesas Butterflyfish alongside some of the more noxious soft corals, but this is something of a risk, and they should be observed carefully. Stony corals and many other sessile invertebrates will be constantly nipped at, so unfortunately must be avoided. Keep only one Marquesas Butterflyfish per tank (unless a mated pair is acquired) and not with any other butterflyfish as they will squabble over territories. Whilst they can be a little shy when first introduced, providing them with ample retreats amongst the live rock will ensure they quickly gain confidence and venture out into the open.

Here they form large aggregations as they feed on zooplankton in the water column. This is a very active, semi-aggressive acanthurid that requires a great deal of swimming space - adults have been known to grow to over a foot and a half long and are powerful fish. If you are blessed with a system of enormous proportions, the Mata Tang could make a wonderful centrepiece. The tank should contain plenty of live rock which this fish will enjoy grazing upon. Include plenty of hiding places that are large enough for the Mata Tang to retreat into quickly should it feel threatened, at the same time aiming for an aquascape that allows plenty of open swimming space along the front of the aquarium for such a powerful swimmer. Mata Tangs are moderately aggressive towards tankmates, and in the confines of the home aquarium, this includes their own kind; for this reason it is best to house just one specimen per tank. There are good reports of this fish mixing with tangs of other genera; however it is recommended that the Mata Tang is the last addition to a set up, as it can be rather territorial to newcomers, especially similar fish species. It is best to source a medium sized specimen (i.e. over 4" in length) as they are more likely to acclimatise well to life in captivity. Conversely, extra large specimens may have a difficult time settling in, so aim for a healthy-looking fish that is neither too small nor excessively large. Avoid any specimens that appear "pinched" in the belly area, and do ask your retailer to show you that your chosen fish is feeding well prior to purchase. Mata Tangs have a high metabolism and require small frequent feeds throughout the day. Powerful filtration/vigorous circulation and a high level of oxygenation are therefore essential for this energetic, voracious eater. Be sure to keep on top of water quality as this fish will not tolerate deteriorating water conditions. A large refugium with living rock can be most useful: macroalgae can be cultured on this rock and these pieces rotated with pieces from the main tank, so that the Mata Tang has a continual supply of natural foodstuffs to graze upon. Take care when handling, as the caudal spines can inflict very painful wounds. A period of quarantine can be a valuable procedure for the acclimatisation of all livestock, and it is of particular importance for the Mata Tang which can be fairly susceptible to developing marine whitespot. This can be difficult to treat in the reef aquarium.

This unusual triggerfish - with its extraordinarily lengthy and somewhat menacing-looking snout - is fairly uncommon and is rarely seen in the trade. It is part of the group of seven so-called 'Picasso triggerfish' of the Rhinecanthus genus, all with remarkably similar traits (with the exception of the favoured habitat of R. abyssus, which is known from much deeper waters compared to that of the other 6 species). This group of fish are primarily brown, grey, or white, and display strongly contrasting patterns in black, blue, orange, or yellow. All adult fish sport a dark line (in most species interspersed with blue) that extends from  the forehead down through the eye to the pectoral fin. As R. cinereus is seldomly seen in the hobby, it is likely to command a somewhat hefty price tag when it is imported. The Mauritius Triggerfish is an outgoing species that, over time, will learn to recognise its owner. Like many other members of this family, it is an aggressive fish that is best maintained in a large fish-only aquarium with tankmates of a similar size and disposition. As the fish matures, so its aggression level will heighten. In addition to a decent amount of swimming space, ample shelter should be provided for it to establish a territory of its own. Mauritius Triggerfish will attack all manner of invertebrate life, which renders it an unsuitable species for the reef aquarium. Care must be taken with the aquascaping as they do like to move aquarium decor around. They are also notorious for biting through tubing, and even heaters, so it is worth thinking carefully about where you place your equipment. Keep only one specimen per tank, and not with any other Triggerfish species, due to territorial nature. Smaller fish are likely to end up on the menu. Although triggerfish often become "hand tame" and beg for food whilst making grunting noises, it is not advisable to feed directly from your hands as the fingers could easily be mistaken for a meaty snack.

 Compared to many other larger filefish, this species is rather less destructive, but much caution is advised if planning on adding to a reef setting; these fish will pick on most sessile invertebrates with the exception of potent stinging sea anemones such as Stichodactyla spp. (carpet anemones). Snails, shrimp, gorgonians, and sponges are particularly vulnerable. Therefore, this hardy species really is best housed in a tank containing live rock only. Saddled Filefish are generally quite passive and docile, especially when first introduced, and should only be kept with tankmates of a similar size and disposition. It should never be kept in the same tank as its model pufferfish, as the filefish will very likely be bullied. Keep one per tank unless a mated pair can be acquired.
In order to tell the Mimic filefish apart from the Valentini Pufferfish, look for the following: the first transverse bar extends further behind the eye in C. valentini; the second transverse bar courses ventrally between the gill opening and pectoral fin base in C. valentini and behind the pectoral fin in P. prionurus; the dark spots between and below the transverse bars are larger and less numerous in P. prionurus; and very large adult P. prionurus specimens often have a dark spot on the middle of the lower part of the cheek, but no such spot is present in C. valentini.

For instance, in Guam, juvenile fish mimic the Lemon Peel Angelfish (C. flavissimus), but where the Lemon Peel Angelfish is absent in Palau, the juvenile fish instead mimic the Halfblack Angelfish (C. vrolikii). A further colour form replicates that of Herald's Angelfish (C. heraldi). This relationship is Batesian, in that the juvenile tang avoids predation because it resembles the less-palatable angelfish.

A dark band covers the gill opening and arcs down to the chin, with a narrow white band encircling the mouth. The caudal fin is lunate and edged with yellow.

These attractive fish require a spacious, mature aquarium with plenty of live rock to both browse upon and hide amongst, plus a decent sand bed ideally 7.5cm (3") deep or more - in which to bury at night or if startled. No matter how often these fish are offered frozen or dried foods, they will starve in a tank without an abundance of mature rockwork, so this must be provided; the fish will prey on the micro-fauna that live amongst the rock, such as tiny shrimps, amphipods, copepods, and small crustaceans, which are easily crushed with its powerful pharyngeal teeth.

In fact, some experts consider S. unimaculatus to be a geographical variant of S. vulpinus, the dark blotch on each flank being the defining feature. You may often see juveniles kept together in large shoals without problems in your local aquatics store, but be aware that as the fish mature, they become intolerant of their own kind within the confines of the aquarium and should be kept singly, with the exception of a bonded male-female pair. Unrelated fish species will be ignored, most giving the One-Spot Fox face a wide berth because of the venomous spines on their dorsal and anal fins. Needless to say, this is a fish that must be handled with much care when catching and acclimatising; ideally it should be gently herded into a submerged fish-bag or solid container, rather than risk using a net to lift it from the water. The fish is likely to erect its fins, entangling the sturdy spines in the netting, and at the same time there is the chance of the aquarist receiving a very painful sting. The tank itself should offer plenty of dark hiding places amongst rockwork, and employ decent filtration and circulation. If adding this species to a reef aquarium, be aware that occasional specimens do have a taste for coral polyps, particularly those that are hungry, so be sure to observe carefully and ensure the fish is receiving enough food. The One-Spot Fox Face has a small mouth that is specially adapted for browsing on algae (the main constituent of its diet). They must receive regular offerings of greenfoods in their diet, otherwise their colours will fade and their health may suffer.

Juvenile fish tend to inhabit shallow protected reef environments, whereas the adults (who are usually found singly or in pairs) favour deep coastal reef slopes and outer reef walls where they can be observed feeding on various types of algae growing on the rocks. This species is rarely encountered in the trade, but if the aquarist is blessed with an enormous system, this fish is well worth looking out for as it would make a wonderful centrepiece. The tank should be mature and contain plenty of live rock which the Orange Face Tang will enjoy grazing upon. Include plenty of hiding places that are large enough for your fish to retreat into quickly should it feel threatened, at the same time aiming for an aquascape that allows plenty of open swimming space along the front of the aquarium for such a powerful swimmer. Orange Face Tangs are not overly aggressive towards tankmates, however they will show hostility towards their own kind and towards other members of the Acanthurus genus - for this reason it is best to house just one specimen per tank. There are good reports of this fish mixing with tangs of other genera; however it is recommended that the Orange Face Tang is the last addition to a set up, as it can be a little territorial to newcomers, especially similar fish species. It is best to source a medium sized specimen (i.e. over 4" in length) as they are more likely to acclimatise well to life in captivity. Conversely, extra large specimens may have a difficult time settling in, so aim for a healthy-looking fish that is neither too small nor excessively large. Avoid any specimens that appear "pinched" in the belly area, and do ask your retailer to show you that your chosen fish is feeding well prior to purchase. Orange Face Tangs have a high metabolism and require small frequent feeds throughout the day. Powerful filtration/circulation and a high level of oxygenation are therefore essential for this energetic, voracious eater. Be sure to keep on top of water quality as this fish will not tolerate deteriorating water conditions. A large refugium with living rock can be most useful: macroalgae can be cultured on this rock and these pieces rotated with pieces from the main tank, so that the Orange Face Tang has a continual supply of natural foodstuffs to graze upon. Take care when handling this species, as the caudal spines are large and can inflict a very painful wound. A period of quarantine can be a valuable procedure for the acclimatisation of all livestock, and it is of particular importance for the Orange Face Tang which can be fairly susceptible to developing marine white spot. This can be difficult to treat in the reef aquarium. Ideally the fish should be quarantined and carefully observed in a separate aquarium for at least a fortnight before being introduced into your main display tank. The pictured fish is a 5" juvenile.

Adults are a two tone grey colour with a bright orange flash ringed in blue across the 'shoulders', just above the pectoral fins. The caudal fin will take on a beautiful lyre shape as the fish mature. Orange Shoulder Tangs occur singly or in shoals, feeding on diatoms, fine filamentous algae, biofilms, and detritus covering the sand and bare rock. This is a large, active species that requires an XXL aquarium with a good deal of swimming space. Although this fish can attain quite a size, it is not as belligerent as some members of the genus, and will typically ignore tankmates, including other tangs that are of similar disposition. It is usually best to keep only one Orange Shoulder Tang per tank, unless the system is vast and there are an abundance of visual barriers.

Orange Spot Gobies like to dig burrows underneath rocks and coral bases, so be sure that any structures are secure, and that there is a good depth of (live) sand in most parts of the aquarium. This will not only enable them to create a burrow, but is also a vital lifeline for them as they sift through this substrate in search for tiny invertebrate food items. The sand is taken in through the mouth, the food items swallowed, and the remaining sand expelled through the gills. These fish are not overly particular where they dump the sand they have sifted, and as it is usually expelled whilst the fish are in motion, it can sometimes end up dropping down onto and swamping prized corals.

The male entices the female into spawning by performing an elaborate mating dance outside his chosen cave or piece of PVC pipe. If the female accepts the male, she will enter the cave/pipe and deposit several hundred eggs, which are simultaneously fertilised by the male. The male then drives the female away and takes on paternal care of the adhesive eggs, gently fanning them with his pectoral fins and even picking them up and moving them to a new location if he feels they are in danger. The eggs should hatch within 3-5 days (temperature dependent) and they remain in a larval state for around 25-30 days. As soon as the eggs hatch, parental care ceases, so you will need to separate the young from the parents and any other fish in the tank just prior to this event. Raising the larvae to adult fish is possible, but very challenging - you will need a ready supply of miniscule foodstuffs such as rotifers available at all times and water quality/tank hygiene must be continually monitored. The female fish can come off a bit the worse for wear following a spawning event (ripped fins, missing scales etc) so be sure to keep a close eye on water quality to ensure she recovers quickly."},{name:"Pacific Crowned Pufferfish",link:"https://www.fishkeeper.co.uk/fish/marine/miscellaneous-fish/pacific-crowned-pufferfish",overview:{Synonyms:"None",Distribution:"Indo-West-Pacific",MaximumSize:'12.5cm (4.9")',Temperature:"Tropical: 23-27°C",WaterParameters:"SG: 1.020-1.025, pH: 8.1-8.4",Compatibility:"Non-Reef; Fish only with live rock",Lighting:"No special requirements","Reef Aquarium Compatibility":"Not reef safe","Sexual Dimorphism":"In mature specimens, the males are larger than the females."},image_url:"https://www.fishkeeper.co.uk/media//cache/2068x/databank/images/image/Pacific-Crowned-Pufferfish-Canthigaster-axiologus.jpg",care:`The Pacific Crowned Pufferfish is a solitary dwarf species known from sheltered environments with sandy/rubble substrates adjacent to coral reefs.

A third, similar looking species, C. cyanospilota is known from the Indian Ocean and Red Sea, and all three species together form what is referred to as the 'Coronata Complex'. Pacific Crowned Pufferfish feed on a wide variety of benthic organisms (including bivalves, brittle stars, bryozoans, crabs, foraminiferans, gastropods, heart urchins, polychaetes, sea urchins, sponges, and tunicates) and as such, are not suitable for reef aquaria. Instead, it is best maintained in a "œfish only, with live rock" set-up where it would pose no danger to corals, ornamental snails, shrimp and other small prized inverts. Tankmates should be chosen carefully; species with long fins should be avoided, as occasional puffer specimens will nip and leave their telltale circular holes in the fins. This behaviour is more likely to become apparent in small tanks, so adequate space must be given. Pacific Crowned Puffers should be kept singly, unless in a known mated pair, and even then, they should be watched carefully lest the male becomes too aggressive.

This diurnal grazer feeds on a range of sessile invertebrates, algae, and plankton, but to a larger extent,  specialises in feeding on sponges. Juveniles of the species exhibit cleaning behaviour with a variety of fish, and adults have been seen cleaning sharks and manta rays. The adults are also often observed forming large shoals with the Cortez Angelfish (Pomacanthus zonipectus) to depths of 30m (98ft). Although the Passer Angelfish feeds predominantly on sponges in the wild, unlike some other members of the genus, they will usually switch to consuming other fare in the home aquarium quite successfully. However, it is still prudent to try and find an ongoing source of frozen sponge-based Angelfish rations for the best long term care. Passer Angelfish will always fare best in spacious, mature aquaria with an abundance of live rock and an open swimming space along the front of the tank. Established systems will provide much more in the way of nutritious micro-invertebrates in the living rock and this will help to supplement the specialised diet. In smaller systems, such critters will be quickly depleted, which is why it is doubly important that this active fish is given ample space. Passer Angelfish demand excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of decent current. Keep only one per tank, and not with any other angelfish. This is a very boisterous species that does best with other semi-aggressive tankmates, and it should be the last fish added to an aquarium. Juvenile specimens are largely dusky orange with one white and several blue stripes (as pictured here). With age the colour pattern morphs into a predominately dark blue background colour with a white vertical stripe extending down from the dorsal fin, stretching approximately 2/3 of the way down to the pelvic fins. The caudal fin and the pectoral fins are yellow, whilst the dorsal and anal fins are tinged with orange. There is some debate amongst ichthyologists as to whether this species displays sexual dichromatism; some believe that the male fish have yellow pelvic fins and the female white, yet others insist it is the females that have yellow pelvic fins, and the males white.

In the wild, the Peacock Wrasse is found over mixed sand, rubble, and coral areas of lagoons and sheltered seaward reefs to depths of 30m (98ft), where it occurs singly, in pairs, or in large aggregations of females, and is usually observed browsing for molluscs and foraminiferans amongst the substratum. This leopard wrasse requires a very mature, spacious aquarium with plenty of live rock and sand that supports its natural diet on an ongoing basis, if it is to thrive. If added to a newly set up tank, it will starve to death. There should be plenty of hiding places amongst the rockwork, with enough depth of substrate (7.5cm/3" of fine sand) for the fish to bury if it feels threatened. Because of the difficulties in feeding this leopard wrasse, it should not be kept with fish that require a similar food source to survive, as otherwise one species may out-compete the other. There should be relatively calm areas in the tank that allow it to locate food successfully. Tankmates should be peaceful and of an easygoing nature so that the Peacock Wrasse does not feel harassed and subsequently stops venturing out to feed. Groups can sometimes be kept together successfully (added simultaneously) but larger numbers should only ever be considered for exceptionally large aquaria, as in the average sized aquarium, natural prey will deplete too quickly with that many fish requiring the same diet. Do not house with other Macropharyngodon species or pugnacious dottybacks and hawkfish, as they will fight for territory. When choosing your leopard wrasse, check that its body is not emaciated, and that it is actively searching for food. It is not uncommon for a newly added leopard wrasse to hide beneath the substrate whilst it adjusts to its new surroundings and altered circadian rhythm; in such cases it is best to leave them be, they will usually begin to explore within a couple of days.

Whilst the shrimp is working, it maintains antenna contact with its goby partner posted at the entrance of the shared burrow. If the shrimp detects the quivering motion of the goby's caudal fin during an unusual situation, it reacts by immediately withdrawing into the depths of the burrow. The entrance to the shared burrow will be closed at night, and only one entrance is usually open at any one time.The shrimp will only emerge from the burrow whilst it can have tactile contact with the goby. Provided with a reasonable depth of coral sand and a good selection of loose coral rubble pieces that vary in size (not too big to be moved) these gobies can do very well in the home aquarium. The goby will survive without its shrimp partner, but if they can be acquired together, they will make such a fascinating display, captivating the observer for hours on end.

Juveniles have been observed amongst floating Sargassum rafts, sub-adults are gregarious and form small groups, whereas adults are solitary. These relatively poor swimmers are nocturnal by nature and feed on crabs, hermit crabs, molluscs, and sea urchins. Young fish display a spotty pattern (particularly prominent on the belly), whereas adults sport dark blotches across the back and spots in between the blotches, the spots becoming fewer with age. This is a popular species for the Fish-Only marine aquarium on account of the fish's rather comical and amiable personality; indeed, many keepers report how these intelligent fish quickly learn to recognise their owners, likening them to "pet dogs", such are their characters and responses to visual stimuli. As Porcupine Pufferfish tend to attain quite a size, a very large tank will be needed to house an adult specimen. Despite its eventual size, this species is relatively gentle for a puffer, although it must still be considered a semi-aggressive fish. Porcupine Pufferfish can be kept in pairs or groups in a vast tank if all fish are of the same size and they are added to the aquarium simultaneously. Tankmates must be of similar size and temperament e.g. large angelfish, large tangs, triggerfish etc. The aquarium should be aquascaped with plenty of rockwork, with some large sized shelters, and an open swimming space along the front. Filtration must be efficient to cope with the voracious eating habits and large amounts of waste that these fish produce, yet water movement should not be too vigorous. Be aware that large pufferfish are notorious for biting through tubing, and even heaters, so it is worth thinking very carefully about where you place your equipment; do also always keep a close eye on where the fish is when carrying out any maintenance in the tank. When frightened, these fish can inflate themselves, causing the long spines to stand erect, which deters predators. This defence mechanism is a last resort, and should never be actively encouraged; it is particularly dangerous if the fish ingests air instead of water. Kept in the right conditions, the Porcupine Pufferfish will become a real "˜pet fish"™ with bags of personality, soon learning to recognise its owner and beg for food.

Hard shelled foods such as cockle-in-shell and crab legs should be given regularly to help keep the beak worn down. A decent amount of living rock in the tank will also give the puffer lots of browsing opportunities which will also help to keep the beak in check. Some herbivorous rations can be given now and again, but avoid any floating foods as the fish may ingest air which can lead to buoyancy problems. Feed small amounts 3 times per day. Please note that this species will constantly "beg" for food in a puppy-like manner, and this does not always mean the fish is genuinely hungry - it is just that they very quickly learn to recognise the aquarist and associate their presence with food, so don't be tricked into overfeeding.`,breeding:"This species has not been bred in the home aquarium.

In the wild, Potter"™s Leopard Wrasse is found over mixed sand, rubble, and coral areas of seaward reefs, where it constantly browses for molluscs and foraminiferans. It is a Batesian mimic of the more robust Potter"™s Angelfish (Centropyge potteri), which affords it better protection from predators. This leopard wrasse requires a very mature, spacious aquarium with plenty of live rock and sand that supports its natural diet on an ongoing basis, if it is to thrive. If added to a newly set up tank, it will starve to death. There should be plenty of hiding places amongst the rockwork, with enough depth of substrate (7.5cm/3" of fine sand) for the fish to bury if it feels threatened. Because of the difficulties in feeding this leopard wrasse, it should not be kept with fish that require a similar food source to survive, as otherwise one species may out-compete the other. There should be relatively calm areas in the tank that allow it to locate food successfully. Tankmates should be peaceful and of an easygoing nature so that the Potter"™s Leopard Wrasse does not feel harassed and subsequently stops venturing out to feed. Groups can sometimes be kept together successfully (added simultaneously) but larger numbers should only ever be considered for exceptionally large aquaria, as in the average sized aquarium, natural prey will deplete too quickly with that many fish requiring the same diet. Do not house with other Macropharyngodon species or pugnacious dottybacks and hawkfish, as they will fight for territory. When choosing your leopard wrasse, check that its body is not emaciated, and that it is actively searching for food.

This diurnal grazer feeds almost exclusively on sponges, supplemented with small amounts of algae, bryozoans, hydroids, and tunicates. Juveniles of the species exhibit cleaning behaviour with a variety of fish, removing ectoparasites from their skin. Adults tend to occur solitary or in pairs, favouring areas rich with corals, seafans, and seawhips, to depths of 70m (230ft). Although the Queen Angelfish feeds predominantly on sponges in the wild, unlike some other members of the genus, they will usually switch to consuming other fare in the home aquarium quite successfully. However, it is still prudent to try and find an ongoing source of frozen sponge-based Angelfish rations for the best long term care. Queen Angelfish will always fare best in spacious, mature aquaria with an abundance of live rock and an open swimming space along the front of the tank. Established systems will provide much more in the way of nutritious micro-invertebrates in the living rock and this will help to supplement the specialised diet. In smaller systems, such critters will be quickly depleted, which is why it is doubly important that this active fish is given ample space. Queen Angelfish demand excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of decent current. Keep only one per tank, and not with any other angelfish. This is a very boisterous species that does best with other semi-aggressive tankmates, and it should be the last fish added to an aquarium. Juvenile specimens are predominantly dark blue with bright yellow chest, pectoral fins, pelvic fins, and tail. The edges of the dorsal and anal fins are royal blue, and there are several light blue, gently curved vertical lines on the flanks. A dark blue mask, edged in royal blue, runs down through the eyes. With age the colour pattern changes: the blue on the flanks becomes brighter and the scales are edged with bright yellow (sometimes giving an overall green appearance when viewed from a distance). The pectoral, pelvic, and caudal fins remain bright yellow, with a large blue spot forming at the base of the pectoral fins. The area on top of the head develops a large black spot that is peppered with electric blue specks and surrounded by an electric blue ring.

Juvenile fish tend to favour rocky inner reef flats or tide pools, but adults have often been observed swimming more out in the open, in pairs or small groups, and feeding on various invertebrates, coral polyps, and algae. In the home aquarium, Raccoon Butterflyfish should be offered plenty of swimming space and a multitude of hiding places. These fish are best kept singly, although if you are blessed with an XXL system, they can be kept in large groups - consisting of same-size fish added simultaneously, to help avoid aggression. Such groups may bicker from time to time, but as long as they are provided with plenty of visual barriers amongst the decor, no real harm should ensue. However, be aware that such groups will not work in smaller quarters. These fish should not be housed with any other butterflyfish species as they will show much hostility towards each other; however, they are usually safe with non-related fish species that can look after themselves (avoid any small, docile species). As mentioned previously, the tanks should contain an abundance of rockwork for the fish to hide amongst, but leave a large open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. As with all butterflies, this species demands excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well-oxygenated, with areas of decent current. Although tending to be of a fairly nocturnal nature in the wild, these fish adapt well to aquarium lighting and feeding schedules and often become very active during the day. Interestingly, the Raccoon Butterflyfish has the ability to change appearance to a dark blotchy form when wanting to blend into its surroundings at night, or when threatened.

These beautiful fish gather in small aggregations amongst crevices, feeding on zooplankton in the water column, but always staying close to cover. Male fish are characteristically territorial and form a harem with a large number of females. This is a great species for the reef tank, and moderately easy to maintain. In the confines of the aquarium, it is best to keep either a solitary specimen, or else a group comprising of a single male and at least 8 females. Unfortunately, smaller groups will result in squabbles, where the weakest fish is likely to be picked on and prevented from feeding, eventually succumbing to being bullied by the others. These large shoals should only be considered if the tank is of XXL proportions "“ if the tank is of average size, it really is best to house a single specimen only. Adults can be kept with moderately pugnacious tankmates such as pygmy angelfish and medium sized tangs etc, as long as the Randall's Anthias are introduced and established first. However, be sure to avoid any large, aggressive species that would prevent the Randall's Anthias from venturing out to feed. These fish are usually perfectly safe in a reef set up, typically ignoring sessile invertebrates. Provide plenty of shady crevices and overhangs amongst the live rock so that these deeper water fish feel secure. Over time, they can become accustomed to brighter lighting, but they should be exposed to more intense illumination very gradually - this is why, when initially introduced, it is so important to provide plenty of refuges from the illumination of the average well-lit reef aquarium. A varied diet is a must to keep the fish in good health and for them to display their vibrant colouration. Ideally they will be fed small amounts several times per day (see below). Powerful filtration and protein skimming, plus a good maintenance regime are essential for maintaining optimal water quality despite the heavy nutrient input. As these fish inhabit areas of great tidal surge in the wild, they require vigorous water movement in the home aquarium - a high level of oxygenation at all times being of utmost importance. Randall"'s Anthias goes through one of the most remarkable colour changes of any Anthias species during the transition from female to male. Females are an overall peach colour on the flanks, which merges into yellow on the tail, around the eye, and on the snout. The dorsal, ventral, and anal fins usually have a very thin blue-purple margin to them. The fins will appear rounded and without filaments, with the exception of the third dorsal ray which may be extended in very mature females or in those females which are transitioning into males. In an aquarium population composed entirely of females, the extension of the third dorsal ray is a certain sign of sex change starting to occur. As a female Randalls Anthias changes into a male, a dramatic colour change occurs. The ventral fins develop a thick red band (as can be seen in the above photographed specimen which was undergoing transition) with yellow centre. At this time, the upper lip extends somewhat, giving the fish a slightly more fat-lipped appearance (this is fairly subtle but more obvious when a male and female are compared side by side). As the change progresses further, the anal, caudal, and dorsal fin tips become more angular and develop long filaments; the anal and dorsal fins turning red and magenta, and the caudal fin changing to a blue-purple hue. The iris also changes from yellow to purple. Much later into the transition, the fish eventually develops thick horizontal bands of red and magenta on the flanks. May also be seen on sale as Randall's Fairy Basslet.`,feeding:"In the wild, this species is constantly on the lookout for food, taking zooplankton from the water column.

As with other members of the same genus, this goby forms a symbiotic partnership with an almost blind alpheid shrimp; together they share the safety of a burrow which the shrimp digs/maintains, and the goby keeps watch for predators. Whilst the shrimp is working, it maintains antennal contact with its goby partner posted at the entrance of the shared burrow. If the shrimp detects the quivering motion of the goby"™s caudal fin during an unusual situation, it reacts by immediately withdrawing into the depths of the burrow. The entrance to the shared burrow will be closed at night, and only one entrance is usually open at any one time. The shrimp will only emerge from the burrow whilst it can have tactile contact with the goby. These fish are peaceful, except towards conspecifics (especially males) - so keep only one per tank or else obtain a mated pair. Provided with a reasonable depth of coral sand and a good selection of loose coral rubble pieces that vary in size (not too big to be moved) these gobies can do very well in the home aquarium.

This is a charming little fish that makes a wonderful addition to the reef aquarium. With pretty colouration and a peaceful nature, Red Head Gobies have been known to reproduce in captivity, so would make for an interesting breeding project. As previously mentioned, Red Head Gobies are regularly observed servicing fish that have ectoparasites, helping to control diseases such as Lymphocystis and marine whitespot. An advantage over most other cleaner fishes is that the Red Head Goby is not an "obligate cleaner" (i.e. it does not rely on cleaning/eating parasites for optimal health). As such, the Red Head Goby will do just as well in a healthy aquarium where it is offered quality commercially prepared foodstuffs. This diminutive goby rarely shows aggression towards other species, although it will fight with members of its own kind, especially in smaller aquaria where space and territories are more limited. Large groups (7+) can be kept if the system is spacious; however in smaller aquaria it is advisable to keep either a single specimen or a known mated pair. Although these gobies cannot be sexed externally, it is often fairly easy to pick out a compatible pair at your local aquarium store as they may have paired off and be resting very close to one another. With regards to compatibility, Red Head Gobies are ideal for community reef aquaria; they are also often purported to coexist with a number of unlikely large predators, which usually tend to leave the gobies alone on account of their known cleaning services. However, much caution is necessary as all fish vary in personality and temperament and there can be no guarantees when it comes to their safety with such tankmates present. Observe carefully and if in any doubt, do not add them to your aquarium. It is not advisable to add Red Head Gobies to an aquarium containing predatory crabs.

You will need to ensure that the eggs are very gently aerated in the absence of the parent fish. The time it takes for the eggs to hatch will vary depending on water temperature and other factors, but on average this is usually around 8 days.

Without such nourishment, these fish tend to waste away. In larger aquaria, multiple specimens can be kept together in the same tank, ideally one male, with several females - all of which should be introduced simultaneously. The male will use his elaborate dorsal fin to display to the females during courtship rituals. If more than one male is present, the rivals will both use their dorsal fins as a show of dominance.

These fish are peaceful, and may be kept in groups if all are added simultaneously when juvenile; when keeping more than one, do ensure that there are plenty of visual barriers amongst the decor. Provided with a reasonable depth of coral sand and a good selection of loose coral rubble pieces that vary in size (not too big to be moved) these hardy little candy-striped gobies will do very well in the home aquarium. A shrimp partner is not strictly necessary, but if they can be acquired together, they will make such a fascinating display, captivating the observer for hours on end. The usual shrimp that partners the Red-banded Goby is Alpheus ochrostriatus, but these gobies often accept different Alpheus spp. if a specific one cannot be found. Your dealer may be able to acquire the two together, it is certainly worth asking.

The Red-spot Flymo is often regarded as a utility fish for helping to control various algal growths in the aquarium. However, these are very personable fish and are fascinating to observe, regardless of their excellent ability at removing and consuming algae. The tank must be well established, and of a good size; these combtooth blennies have been known to starve in smaller quarters once the main food source has been depleted and not had time to re-establish. When Red-spot Flymo blennies feed, skip over rocks, graze dÃ©cor and generally go about their business, they tend to stir up detritus where it goes into suspension and is then removed by the filtration. Ensure that the tank has efficient filtration with areas of brisk water movement (in order to simulate the surge-like conditions this fish favours) along with some calmer resting spots out of the current. As this species requires a mature tank, it works out well that this should be the last fish added to the tank, preferably at a size around 2.5" where it should not be over-dominant. However, in general, Red-spot Flymo blennies can be fairly feisty and quite territorial over the bottom of the aquarium, particularly as they mature; therefore it is best to keep only one per tank, and careful consideration given to tankmates - avoiding other blennies and similar-looking bottom dwelling species such as gobies (unless you are blessed with a tank of vast proportions incorporating a huge number of visual barriers amongst the rockwork, and more than enough food to go round on a continual basis). It should be noted that the Red-spot Flymo will not feed on every kind of algae - they particularly relish the filamentous type, but will ignore bubble and slime algae.

Filtration should be oversized, with highly efficient protein skimming and powerful circulation. In the wild, Regal Tangs are found in loose aggregations a metre or so above the substrate in current-swept terraces of the seaward reefs. When startled, they dive for cover amongst the branches of Pocillopora corals. The bulk of their diet is made up of zooplankton, but they do consume some algae. The tank should be aquascaped with a decent amount of living rock to provide welcome bolt holes, leaving an open swimming space along the front of the tank. Regal Tangs should not harm sessile invertebrates, provided that they are feeding well and consuming a balanced diet. This species is not overly aggressive and can be kept in groups if space permits (specimens should be of the same size and introduced simultaneously). Juvenile fish shoal together, but adults require much more territory and will squabble if there is not enough room. For this reason it is best to keep one adult per tank, unless you are blessed with a vast system. Tankmates should be of a peaceable nature and not direct food competitors. Avoid fish that are too boisterous and which might prevent the Regal Tang from feeding, as head and lateral line erosion (HLLE) can quickly develop if the fish is undernourished, as can marine whitespot, which this species is prone to if stressed. Close relatives from the acanthurid (tang/surgeonfish) family are best avoided too. When choosing a Regal Tang for your aquarium, do ensure that they do not look underweight with a "pinched in" appearance, and instead have a nice full-looking body and are alert and inquisitive. A period of quarantine can be a valuable procedure for the acclimatisation of all livestock, and it is of particular importance for the Regal Tang which, as mentioned above, can be quite susceptible to developing whitespot. This can be difficult to treat in the reef aquarium.

Juveniles are usually solitary, but adults are often observed feeding in groups on crustaceans and tiny fishes. This elongate wrasse is one of 4 currently known species of Hologymnosus, and although all are hardy, beautiful fish, they do attain a very large adult size. Due to this and their extremely active nature, they require a voluminous aquarium. These fish feed mainly on small, hard-shelled prey including crustaceans and molluscs, so it is a species that should be added to the reef tank with some caution. Although it should not trouble corals, it will feed on a variety of invertebrates (see Reef Aquarium Compatibility section). The tank should be mature and furnished with plenty of living rock to provide feeding opportunities, shady hiding places and visual barriers. There should be a deep sand bed of around 3" (7.5cm) or so, in order that the wrasse may bury itself at night or if startled. Keep either a single specimen, or, if the tank is large enough, a good sized group of 5 or 6 individuals (introduced simultaneously, when young and of the same size). Tankmates must be chosen with care due to the large size attained by these wrasse. Young Ring Wrasses rarely cause problems in a community type set-up, but as they grow, larger adults will prey on small passive fish, e.g. flasher wrasses, fairy wrasses, and firefish, so combinations such as these are best avoided. Powerful filtration and circulation with a high level of oxygenation are a must, as are tight fitting coverslides; these fish are expert jumpers. All male Ring Wrasses are the result of a sex change; these fish are protogynous sequential hermaphrodites and there are three primary phases, their colour and size depending on whether they are terminal phase (TP) males a.k.a "supermales", initial phase (IP) males, or females. All juveniles start out as females. IP males and females have the ability to change into TP males and this switch includes a dramatic change of size and coloration. Once transformed from IP male or female to TP male, the change is permanent. It should be noted that in the aquarium, TP males are particularly territorial. The colour of these fish also depends on age, mood, and geographical location. Juvenile fish sometimes display a thick horizontal dark brown bar along the flanks, closely resembling juveniles of the Blue Blanquillo (Malacathus latovittatus), and other times this horizontal bar fades to brown or yellow, revealing a series of 17-19 thin black vertical bars along the flanks. The caudal fin is also slightly rounded in juveniles. Adult females are a muted black; TP males are deeper bodied with green flanks (sometimes shading to blue-green ventrally) with numerous bluish red bars, often with a pale yellowish bar on body above the origin of anal fin, and the head is light purplish with a few green to blue-green bands radiating from each eye and onto the snout.

It is essential that this species is placed into an XXL mature system with an abundance of live rock, where it can continually browse upon its natural fare of sponges, tunicates, zoanthids, and algae. A fishless refugium can also be utilised to grow suitable foodstuffs on small pieces of live rock for your Rock Beauty, and these placed into the main tank on a rotational basis. Specialised sponge-based frozen foods purposely developed for angelfish are available too. Specimens that do not receive the proper diet may appear to be feeding well, but after a few months, will gradually fade away due to lack of proper nutrition. If you can provide a Rock Beauty with a suitable home and diet, be sure to choose a healthy specimen that is neither too small nor too large (3-4" is about the ideal size) as tiny or adult specimens can be reluctant feeders and tend not to cope with the stress of capture and transport quite so well. Very young fish may even try to feed from the slime coat of other fish within the same aquarium, causing them irritation. Check with your dealer that the fish is feeding well on the correct foods (ask to see this) and that it appears bright and inquisitive. The most suitable aquarium for a Rock Beauty will be extra wide as well as lengthy. This will enable you to aquascape the tank with a large quantity of live rock (which will provide ongoing grazing opportunities, and refuges for when the angelfish is resting or if startled) whilst still being able to maintain a good amount of open swimming space. Despite its size, this is a fish that is easily bullied. Tankmates should not be aggressive, and there should be no other angelfish present. Keep only one Rock Beauty per tank.

This elongate wrasse is one of 11 currently known species of Pseudojuloides, and although all are incredibly beautiful, this genus is considered rather delicate and does have some specialist care requirements that must be fulfilled by the advanced aquarist if these fish are to acclimatise well to life in captivity. The Royal Pencil Wrasse requires a very mature, spacious aquarium with plenty of healthy live rock and sand that supports its natural diet on an ongoing basis, if it is to thrive. If added to a newly set up tank, it will starve to death. There should be plenty of hiding places amongst the rockwork, with enough depth of substrate (7.5cm/3" of fine sand) for the fish to bury if it feels threatened. Because of the difficulties in feeding this wrasse, it should not be kept with fish that require a similar food source to survive, as otherwise one species may out-compete the other. There should be relatively calm areas in the tank that allow it to locate food successfully. Tankmates should be peaceful and of an easygoing nature so that the Royal Pencil Wrasse does not feel harassed and subsequently stops venturing out to feed. Keep only one male per tank; groups, comprised of one male and several females, can sometimes be kept together successfully (added simultaneously) but larger numbers should only ever be considered for exceptionally voluminous aquaria, as in the average sized aquarium, natural prey will deplete too quickly with that many fish requiring the same diet. Do not house with different Pseudojuloides species, other wrasses, or pugnacious dottybacks and hawkfishes, as they will fight for territory. When choosing your Royal Pencil Wrasse, check that its body is not emaciated, and that it is actively searching for food.

This diminutive, bright scarlet and yellow fish is found amongst areas of broken coral rubble that is interspersed with outcrops of soft and stony corals, to depths of 38m (125ft). Like its close relative, the Scooter Blenny, this species has an interesting method of locomotion, using oversized ventral fins to "scoot" along the substrate and habitually perch as it feeds on microfauna. Although this fish has been seen in the trade for several years, it has only recently been formally described. When keeping the Ruby Red Dragonet in the home aquarium, it is vitally important that the tank is fully mature, with plenty of live rock and a living sand bed which will provide the fish with natural foodstuffs. For this reason, although Ruby Red Dragonets do not grow especially large, an aquarium with a decent footprint (length and width) is important to provide enough food on a continual basis. Without such nourishment, these fish tend to waste away. In larger aquaria, multiple specimens can be kept together in the same tank, ideally one male, with several females - all of which should be introduced simultaneously. The male will use his elaborate dorsal fin to display to the females during courtship rituals. If more than one male is present, the rivals will both use their dorsal fins as a show of dominance. To keep more than one male in the same tank, the aquarium must be of generous proportions, with plenty of visual barriers, and the specimens added simultaneously when juvenile. Tankmates should be small and peaceful, so that the Ruby Red Dragonet is not bullied or harassed at feeding times.

This species is regarded as moderately difficult, and is therefore recommended for advanced aquarists only. A large, mature system is requisite, along with ample live rock for the fish to browse upon/hide amongst and a large open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Medium sized specimens tend to acclimatise better to aquarium life, adapting much more quickly to various prepared foods, so try and choose a healthy, alert specimen around 10cm (4") in length. Smaller sized fish may be reluctant to feed, and larger specimens can be very finicky, requiring significant space and faultless water conditions. An aquarium that has some areas of lush filamentous algae growth will also aid your new fish in settling into its new surroundings; however, as with other butterflyfish species, these fish demand excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of brisk current.

This is a popular and robust aquarium fish which thrives in mature reef aquaria. A host anemone - some of which can be a little tricky to maintain successfully in captivity - is not strictly necessary for your clownfish as most reef set ups contain plenty of hiding places, no large predatory fish, and sometimes cleaner shrimp/cleaner wrasse.

Many species of clownfish (including the Saddleback) are now captive-raised, so wherever possible the conscientious aquarist should aim to source these hardier specimens for the home aquarium, in turn helping to take pressure off the reefs. This is a beautiful but variable species, with a brown, orange, or almost black body. There is a thick white vertical bar behind each eye, a large white saddle shaped marking dorsally over the centre of the body, and thick white edging to the black caudal fin; sometimes there is an additional white marking over the caudal peduncle. As these fish can be somewhat territorial, keep only one pair per tank, providing them with ample space and plenty of visual barriers amongst the dÃ©cor. It is also best not to mix this species with other species of clownfish as they will fight. With regards to sexing, all clownfish are born as males. A wild colony may consist of a breeding pair, which cohabit with a few non-reproductive smaller male specimens. When the female dies, the dominant male will change sex and become the female. This is known as protandrous sequential hermaphroditism. In the case of two juvenile specimens in the home aquarium, the larger of the two will become the female.

Secondly, the more space available in a reef setting, the chances are that there will be much larger, stable colonies of suitable SPS corals available, and so it is less likely that these fish will damage any one individual beyond repair as they go about their daily routines (hiding/resting amongst the branches, and feeding on the occasional mucous polyp). If these types of corals are not being cultivated in your aquarium, invest in several coral skeletons so that these fish have something natural to interact with and give them a sense of security. Saffron Coral Gobies may be kept in groups (but only in larger quarters where there is an abundance of hiding places/territories), and oftentimes these fish will pair up and spawn. With regards to tankmates, these should all be small, non-aggressive feeders. These gobies actually produce a toxic body slime that deters many species from trying to consume them. Having said that, obviously do not house these fish with large carnivores.

However, raising the young is extremely challenging. These fish tend to strip a small area of coral polyps in order to create a place to deposit the eggs, although other sites are not unheard of. The male fish will dance/quiver in front of the female and when she is ready to spawn, she will deposit her eggs on the coral branch, and these are immediately fertilised and subsequently guarded by the male. The eggs are very small (less than 1mm in diameter) and can number several hundred. The presence of the eggs on the coral may cause a small amount of tissue recession in that area, but this should recover quickly once the eggs have hatched (4-5 days, dependent on water temperature).

Juvenile fish live amongst clumps of floating Sargassum, which affords them protection until they are more fully developed; in fact, some have been observed drifting over 100 miles from the nearest coast! The Sargassum Triggerfish is one of the few triggerfish species that can be safely kept in most reef aquaria. Sessile invertebrates are typically ignored, but it must be mentioned that larger Sargassum Triggerfish are likely to eat any ornamental shrimp they come across. These fish are therefore ideal for those spacious reef set ups without any crustaceans. Sargassum Triggerfish can be kept in a mated pair, or even in groups if introduced simultaneously. Filtration should be efficient and the water well oxygenated with areas of brisk current. Although this species may be a little shy when first introduced to the aquarium, the fish will soon gain confidence and may even spit water at the surface in anticipation of feeding time. Tankmates should be chosen with care as Sargassum Triggerfish, whilst not anywhere near as belligerent as other members of the family, can still be moderately aggressive. Tiny, placid fish should be avoided. As with all fish, personalities can differ and there are occasional reports of "˜rogue fish"™. The vast majority of specimens will be safe in a reef environment, but we advise that you observe your individual specimens carefully.

These fish are often observed in pairs, and are notorious for making audible grunting sounds when divers approach. The Sixbar Angelfish is a large-growing, active species which requires a voluminous aquarium. This fish is territorial so provide plenty of live rockwork that has a multitude of visual barriers and bolt holes, as well as a roomy swimming space along the front of the tank. Keep only one specimen per tank, and not with any other angelfish. Tankmates should be equally large and belligerent - this species should never be kept with invertebrates or small, passive fish. The aquarium should be well filtered, as these fish are voracious eaters, and there should be areas of decent current and good levels of oxygenation. Sixbar Angelfish feed on many sessile invertebrates in the wild, including sponges, stony corals, and tunicates, so it is not a safe species for every set up; however, it can usually be kept successfully alongside some of the more noxious soft corals. We recommend that the Sixbar Angelfish is the last addition to an aquarium, as otherwise it can behave somewhat pugnaciously when introducing new tankmates into what it perceives as its established domain. Juvenile fish look very different to the adults: young fish are dark-blue/black with numerous white upright but slightly curving stripes on the flanks, originating just in front of the caudal peduncle. The white stripes change to cyan/blue as they meet the dorsal and anal fins, and the two stripes on the head area are blue. Adult fish have a creamy beige body with five dark vertical stripes; a bright white vertical stripe just behind the eye, makes stripe number six. Dark blue dots pepper the entire body, with bright blue spots covering the caudal and posterior portion of the anal fin.

In the wild, the peaceful Snake Pipefish is known from calm reef flats and lagoons (and sometimes the deeper portions of seaward reefs that are not disturbed by the pummelling wave action further above) over sandy or mixed sand and rubble substrates. Here these curious syngnathids may be observed in pairs or small aggregations, slinking along just above the substrate in a manner akin to a 'horizontal seahorse', feeding on various tiny benthic crustaceans. The home aquarium must be tailored specifically to their needs. Filtration should be thorough, but water movement gentle. Ensure that these fish cannot be drawn against filter intakes or blown into the decor by current that is too vigorous. Provide plenty of shady overhangs amongst living rock, and shelter in the form of gorgonians, coral skeletons, marine plants and the like. Best maintained in pairs or small groups.

Here, this elongate bottom-dweller may be found in the narrow nooks and crannies between rocks and corals, at a maximum depth of 48m (158ft), but is most commonly encountered at around 10m (33ft) or less. It forages mainly at night on crustaceans but will also take small fishes. The aquarium should be spacious and mature, with a soft sandy substrate. Most importantly, it should be securely covered to prevent the eel escaping on to the floor. Create plenty of narrow, shady refuges in the rockwork that the eel can explore and hide amongst, ensuring that all decor is stable and cannot be undermined. Suitable crevices should have a fairly narrow entrance hole but be roomy enough behind for the eel to conceal its entire body within. Most of the day will be spent with its head projecting from this favoured shelter. Unfortunately, this fish is not recommended for reef aquaria, as ornamental crustaceans and small fishes may be eaten, and corals that are not securely attached to the rockwork may be accidentally toppled. The Snowflake Moray grows large and is a voracious eater, so ensure that the filtration/protein skimming is very efficient and capable of coping with the erratic loading that results from big meals and subsequent spikes in waste output. Circulation should be good, with areas of brisk water movement and some calmer resting spots out of the current. This fish is normally mild-mannered, but becomes somewhat frenzied at feeding times - resist the temptation to hand feed youngsters, as adults that associate fingers with food are something of a liability! Can be kept in groups if space allows, but do ensure all specimens are of the same size and are added simultaneously, as newcomers added at a later date are rarely accepted. Tankmates can include many medium-large sized fish that thrive in a similar set up. The Snowflake Moray Eel is an excellent candidate for those willing to set-up a tank around its specific needs and combines all the appeal of an eel in a fairly manageable package.

Juvenile fish are often observed cleaning other fish in captivity, but they are facultative cleaners and not obligatory like some species. This hardy fish may be a little shy when first introduced, but it will soon gain much confidence, becoming a very outgoing aquarium occupant. As this is one of the larger members of the hogfish family, the tank must offer plenty of space for this powerful swimmer, plus hiding places amongst large caves/rock piles in the decor, along with a reasonable amount of substrate to root around in. Be sure to keep on top of water quality; powerful filtration, brisk circulation, and a high level of oxygenation are essential for this voracious eater. Spanish Hogfish are fiercely territorial so it is recommended to keep only one specimen per tank, and not with any other hogfish species, or with any small, docile fish.

This is a species notorious for readily excreting the poison ostracitoxin when stressed - a deadly toxin which is capable of wiping out an entire tank. It is therefore best to house either a single specimen or one male-female pair. Never keep more than one male in the same tank as bickering and subsequent ostracitoxin release is very likely to occur. If tankmates are desired, they must be peaceful so as not to harass the boxfish; however, their continued safety will be precarious, hence why a species-only set up is highly recommended. In the wild, Spotted Boxfish inhabit clear lagoons and reefs. They are considered relatively poor swimmers and for this reason have developed protection via toxin release. The impressive teeth are used to scrape tunicates and sponges off of rocks, which form the bulk of the diet along with various algae, bivalves, snails, polychaete worms, molluscs etc. For this reason, these fish are not suited to reef tanks, although there should be some live rock in the tank to provide welcome shelters and grazing opportunities. A large open swimming space should be provided so that the boxfish are able to swim out and about during daylight hours when they are usually at their most active. Despite their less-than-nimble method of locomotion, Spotted Boxfish are capable of jumping from open topped tanks, so tight fitting coverslides are a must. Care must be taken when carrying out maintenance on the aquarium, so as to keep the fish as calm as possible. Ideally the tank will be situated where there is as little foot traffic going past as possible too. Lights should turn on and off very gradually via the use of a dimmer - sudden bright light can shock the boxfish into toxin release.

The aquarium should be mature and incorporate plenty of live rock. The presence of healthy established colonies of branching corals is essential, as this is where the Spotted Coral Croucher will take up residence.

Keep only one per tank unless your supplier can source you a mated pair. Tankmates should be of a peaceful nature as Spotted Coral Crouchers are very shy feeders and are easily out-competed. It is best to ensure your chosen fish is feeding well before purchase (ask to see the fish being fed) and also whilst it is in quarantine prior to adding to your main display tank. Target feeding small meaty foods with a turkey baster can very much help to ensure your Spotted Coral Croucher is receiving the nutrition it needs, and starting this during the quarantine period can help your fish get used to this process. As they rarely venture out very far from their chosen coral to take food from open water, the aquarist must be prepared to regularly target feed the fish in this way, aiming the food directly into the places where the fish are resting. Take care when handling Spotted Coral Crouchers during acclimatisation and when carrying out maintenance, as they are mildly venomous. Although always rather reclusive, well-settled specimens can become relatively tame, watching everything that the aquarist is doing with much interest (in a manner akin to hawkfish).

The male entices the female into spawning by performing an elaborate mating dance outside his chosen cave.

The male then drives the female away and takes on paternal care of the adhesive eggs, gently fanning them with his pectoral fins and even picking them up and moving them to a new location if he feels they are in danger. The eggs should hatch within 3-6 days (temperature dependent) and they remain in a larval state for around 30 days. As soon as the eggs hatch, parental care ceases, so you will need to separate the young from the parents and any other fish in the tank just prior to this event. Raising the larvae to adult fish is possible, but very challenging - you will need a ready supply of miniscule foodstuffs such as rotifers available at all times and water quality/tank hygiene must be continually monitored.

These fish are usually observed in pairs, hovering just a few centimetres above the sandy/rubbly substrate at the entrance to their burrow, which they share with an alpheid (pistol) shrimp. This diminutive bottom-dweller has a beautiful semi-translucent white body with orange spots interspersed with tiny blue-white specks and an elongated anterior dorsal fin ray. Tangaroa Shrimp Gobies are very passive and make a great addition to peaceful reef aquaria. They are best kept in a compatible male-female pair (your supplier may be able to source you a mated pair) but be sure not to simply place two individuals together from different sources, as if it turns out that they are both males, they will fight - especially in smaller aquaria. The tank should be furnished with plenty of live rock and a reasonable depth of sandy substrate (~10cm/4"), with a good selection of small rubble pieces that vary in size (not too big to be moved), from which a burrow can be created. Tankmates should be small and peaceful, as pugnacious species will intimidate these diminutive bottom dwellers and prevent them from feeding. As with other members of the same genus, this goby forms a symbiotic partnership with an almost blind alpheid shrimp; together they share the safety of a burrow which the shrimp digs/maintains, and the goby keeps watch for predators. Whilst the shrimp is working, it maintains antennal contact with its goby partner posted at the entrance of the shared burrow. If the shrimp detects the quivering motion of the goby"™s caudal fin during an unusual situation, it reacts by immediately withdrawing into the depths of the burrow, hastily followed by the goby. The entrance to the shared burrow will be closed at night, and only one entrance is usually open at any one time. The shrimp will only emerge from the burrow whilst it can have tactile contact with the goby. A shrimp partner is not strictly necessary, but if they can be acquired together, they will make such a fascinating display, captivating the observer for hours on end.

  Cheap and extremely hardy, juvenile Humbugs are very attractive and reef-friendly, but grow into extremely aggressive fish that are likely to terrorise their tankmates. As with all damsels other than clownfish, dominant fish become male. Social groupings consist of a single territorial male, one or more females and unsexed juvenile fish. In the aquarium a stable group can be created, ideally by mixing individuals of different sizes that duplicate this natural order, or allowing sufficient space for weaker fish to escape serious harassment until a dominant individual develops. Any new humbugs added should be significantly smaller than established ones, duplicating the recruitment of juveniles from the plankton. Expect the male to defend a spawning site vigorously from all intruders apart from females ready to spawn.
  Their aquarium should be spacious and include plenty of rockwork to break sightlines and create hiding spots; try to aquascape it in such a way as to create several visual barriers as this will help to minimise aggression levels. Although hardy, good filtration is a must and decent water movement will be appreciated. Peaceful tankmates are likely to be killed in all but the largest aquaria.
Humbugs are an active, interesting species to keep but do need to be kept in a stocking scheme that is well thought out beforehand.

Many species of clownfish (including the Tomato) are now captive-raised, so wherever possible the conscientious aquarist should aim to source these hardier specimens for the home aquarium, in turn helping to take pressure off the reefs. This is a colourful species, with a vivid tomato red-orange coloured body and a vertical white stripe behind the eyes. Captive raised fish tend to be slightly darker in colouration when young, but soon turn a bright orange-red. As these fish can be somewhat territorial, keep only one pair per tank, providing them with ample space and plenty of visual barriers amongst the decor. It is also best not to mix this species with other species of clownfish as they will fight. With regards to sexing, all clownfish are born as males. A wild colony may consist of a breeding pair, which cohabit with a few non-reproductive smaller male specimens. When the female dies, the dominant male will change sex and become the female. This is known as protandrous sequential hermaphroditism. In the case of two juvenile specimens in the home aquarium, the larger of the two will become the female.

The pair will then choose a spawning site, usually a smooth rocky surface such as a flat wall inside a cave, and if a host anemone is present, the spawning site will usually be within close vicinity for protection. Several hundred elliptical red-coloured eggs will be deposited. These adhere to the substrate via fine threads at the ventral pole, and the male will aerate them by fanning them with his pectoral fins whilst guarding against predators. The eggs will hatch after 7-10 days, and the larvae typically settle after another 9 days or so.

Adults usually swim solitary or in small harems as they cruise amongst large corals, whereas the smaller juvenile fish stay even closer to the reef and swim with their heads down and dorsal and anal fins held erect, so as to make themselves appear much larger to any predators (when viewed side-on, the fish resembles the face of a bigger fish, largely due to the prominent eyespots). These attractive fish require a spacious, mature aquarium with plenty of live rock to both browse upon and hide amongst, plus a decent sand bed "ideally 7.5cm (3") deep or more - in which to bury at night or if startled. No matter how often these fish are offered frozen or dried foods, they will starve in a tank without an abundance of mature rockwork, so it is absolutely essential that this is provided; the fish will prey on the micro-fauna that live amongst the rock, such as tiny shrimps, amphipods, copepods, and small crustaceans, which are easily crushed with its powerful pharyngeal teeth. For this reason, these fish cannot be kept alongside ornamental crustaceans and shrimps, as these items form part of its natural diet. Sessile invertebrates, however, will be perfectly safe. Effective filtration and circulation with a high level of oxygenation are a must in order to maintain optimal water conditions. Tight-fitting coverslides are also essential, as these fish are expert jumpers.

A large mature reef aquarium with a deep sand bed and a well-established refugium are essential for this species, which is recommended for advanced aquarists only. Twostripe Gobies like to dig burrows underneath rocks and coral bases, so be sure that any structures are secure, and that there is a good depth of (live) sand in most parts of the aquarium.

The sand is taken in through the mouth, the food items swallowed, and the remaining sand expelled through the gills. These fish are not overly particular where they dump the sand they have sifted, and as it is usually expelled whilst the fish are in motion, it can sometimes end up dropping down onto and swamping prized corals.

Juveniles are often associated with weedy areas of estuaries where there is ample cover for them to develop in relative safety. Adults are usually solitary and fairly territorial. They typically feed on various types of algae (including coralline), mollusks, crabs, tunicates, sponges, corals, zoanthids, tube worms, and echinoderms; feeding on hard prey keeps the beak from overgrowing. Therefore due to such eating habits, these fish are not suitable for keeping in a reef setting in the home aquarium. As Whitespotted Pufferfish tend to attain quite a size, a very large tank will be needed to house an adult specimen. Despite its eventual size, this species is relatively gentle for a puffer, although it must still be considered a semi-aggressive fish. Keep only one per tank and not with any other pufferfish; ideally, tankmates will be of similar size and temperament. The aquarium should be aquascaped with plenty of rockwork, with some large-sized shelters, and an open swimming space along the front. Filtration must be efficient to cope with the voracious eating habits and large amounts of waste that these fish produce, yet water movement should not be too vigorous. Be aware that large pufferfish are notorious for biting through tubing, and even heaters, so it is worth thinking very carefully about where you place your equipment; do also always keep a close eye on where the fish is when carrying out any maintenance in the tank. The general coloration of the White-spotted Pufferfish is an overall grey-brown, with the back, sides, and caudal fin speckled with white spots. The belly area is marked with white stripes. These markings lend themselves to the alternative common name of the Stars and Stripes Puffer. As the fish mature, the white spots appear smaller in proportion to the rest of the fish. When frightened, these fish can inflate themselves to more than twice their original size to deter predators. This defense mechanism is a last resort, and should never be actively encouraged; it is particularly dangerous if the fish ingests air instead of water. Kept in the right conditions, the Whitespotted Puffer will become a real "pet fish" with bags of personality, soon learning to recognize its owner and beg for food.

This is a species notorious for readily excreting the poison ostracitoxin when stressed - a deadly toxin that is capable of wiping out an entire tank. Never keep more than one in the same tank as bickering and subsequent ostracitoxin release is very likely to occur. If tankmates are desired, they must be peaceful so as not to harass the boxfish; however, their continued safety will be precarious, hence why an aspecies-only set up is highly recommended. These fish have impressive teeth which are used to scrape algae (containing various microorganisms) tunicates and sponges off of rocks, and this forms the bulk of the diet along with various bivalves, snails, polychaete worms, mollusks, foraminiferans, and small fishes. For this reason, Yellow Boxfish are not suited to reef tanks, although there should be some live rock in the tank to provide welcome shelters and grazing opportunities. The tank must be very spacious and a large open swimming area should be provided so that the boxfish is able to swim out and about during daylight hours when usually they are at their most active.

All foods should be offered towards the bottom of the tank to avoid the boxfish drawing in air when trying to take food from the surface. Boxfish have very small mouths and stomachs and it is of extreme importance that they are fed small amounts throughout the day to prevent starvation(something which may not always be immediately apparent because of the rigid bony plates along the sides of the boxfish).

The modified ventral fins have fused to form a kind of suction cup that helps them to maintain position on coral branches in swift currents. Yellow Coral Gobies are generally of a peaceful nature and make a wonderful addition to mature reef aquaria containing established colonies of broad-branching SPS corals, which they very much enjoy hiding amongst. Although often recommended for nano aquaria because of its diminutive size, caution should be exercised for two reasons. Firstly, smaller tanks will limit the number of individuals you can keep together; only one specimen is recommended in small nano type tanks, otherwise there will be constant arguments over territory which could result in the untimely demise of the weaker individual. Secondly, the more space available in a reef setting, the chances are that there will be much larger, stable colonies of suitable SPS corals available, and so it is less likely that these fish will damage any one individual beyond repair as they go about their daily routines (hiding/resting amongst the branches, and feeding on the occasional mucous polyp). If these types of corals are not being cultivated in your aquarium, invest in several coral skeletons so that these fish have something natural to interact with and give them a sense of security. Yellow Coral Gobies may be kept in groups (but only in larger quarters where there is an abundance of hiding places/territories), and oftentimes these fish will pair up and spawn.

These fish tend to strip a small area of coral polyps in order to create a place to deposit their eggs, although other sites are not unheard of. The male fish will dance/quiver in front of the female and when she is ready to spawn, she will deposit her eggs on the coral branch, and these are immediately fertilised and subsequently guarded by the male.

Keep only one Yellowhead Butterflyfish per tank and do not house with any other butterflyfish as they will squabble over territories. Whilst they can be a little shy when first introduced, providing them with ample retreats amongst the live rock will ensure they quickly gain confidence and venture out into the open. Once settled, these peaceful fish actually become very assertive feeders and will compete with most other fish species. In the wild, natural hybrids with the Saddled Butterflyfish (C. ephippium) have been observed where their ranges overlap. May also be seen on sale as Goldhead/Goldheaded Butterflyfish, Goldring Butterflyfish, or Yellowheaded Butterflyfish.',feeding:'Feed small amounts several times per day, and be sure to offer a good variety of different foods.

These fish need a mixed substrate that is at least 10cm (3.9") deep. Ideally this will be comprised of 75% coral sand, and 25% small pieces of reef rubble (varying from approx. 0.5cm to 1.5cm in diameter). This will allow to the fish to construct a burrow, in which it will spend much time hovering just near the entrance, continuously rearranging things around and within its little tunnel. At night they sometimes close the entrance of the burrow with a larger pebble as they reverse in. The aquarium must have a tight fitting cover, as these fish will jump, and lighting should always be turned on gradually so as not to startle your fish. Their constant excavation and digging means that powerful filtration and water movement is prerequisite. Yellowhead Jawfish may be kept in small groups; in fact they often do better this way, but do ensure that there is adequate space for them all to construct their homes (in the wild they may live as close as 30cm to one another). Ideally all will be introduced at the same time to eliminate any territorial issues. Tankmates should be small and docile.',feeding:"Offer a varied diet of small meaty frozen foods such as Mysis, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, plankton, and finely chopped krill/prawn/cockle/mussel.

Courting and spawning is said to occur at dusk or dawn. Yellowhead Jawfish are paternal mouthbrooders, meaning that the male fish incubates the eggs. These should hatch within 7-9 days.

Juvenile fish act as cleaners for small, territorial species (such as damselfish), removing problematic ectoparasites from their skin. However, this behaviour ceases as the fish mature, with adult fish feeding exclusively on a wide variety of coral polyps. For this reason, they are unsuitable for the reef aquarium, and are best suited to Fish-Only aquariums of medium sized species. These pretty, striped fish are easy to keep, but a spacious aquarium is a necessity as they are active, powerful swimmers. Ideally, there will also be plenty of rockwork and a sandy substrate, along with clean, well oxygenated water incorporating areas of fast current. Ensure the tank is well covered, as this species will jump from an open topped aquarium. The common name 'tubelip' was coined due to the thick, fleshy lips forming a short tube when the mouth is closed.

Here, this elongate bottom-dweller may be found in the narrow nooks and crannies between rocks and corals, at a maximum depth of 50m (164ft). It typically feeds overnight, with xanthid crabs making up the bulk of the diet, but will also take other crustaceans, molluscs, and urchins. Close-set, pebble-like teeth enable these eels to crush hard-shelled prey with ease. The aquarium should be spacious and mature, with a soft sandy substrate. Create plenty of narrow, shady refuges in the rockwork that the eel can explore and hide amongst, ensuring that all decor is stable and cannot be undermined. Suitable crevices should have a fairly narrow entrance hole but be roomy enough behind for the eel to conceal its entire body within. Unfortunately, this fish is not recommended for reef aquaria, as although small fish are rarely taken, ornamental invertebrates will be eaten without exception, and corals which are not securely attached to the rockwork may be accidentally toppled. The Zebra Eel grows large and is a voracious eater, so ensure that the filtration/protein skimming is very efficient, with areas of brisk water movement and some calmer resting spots out of the current. This fish is relatively mild-mannered and reclusive, but it can become more pugnacious at feeding times. Conspecifics are not well tolerated, so it is best to maintain just one Zebra Eel per tank. Companions can include many medium-large sized fish that thrive in a fish-only set up. Ensure that the aquarium has tight fitting coverslides and no gaps where equipment feeds into the tank, as these fish are proficient escape artists. Whilst most moray eels are poorly suited to life in the home aquarium, the Zebra Eel is an excellent candidate for those willing to set-up a tank around its specific needs.

As adults, these shoaling fish gather in numbers to feed on the abundance of zooplankton that the currents deliver. Hemitaurichthys is an often overlooked genus, containing 4 known species. It is a shame that they are not seen more often in the trade, as these are relatively hardy fish that acclimatize well to aquarium life, and if well fed, they usually pose no problems in reef aquaria that house some of the more noxious soft corals. A number of aquarists have even found them to be completely reef-safe, but as with such matters, "your mileage may vary", and we would recommend exercising caution and careful observation. Zoster Butterflyfish grow reasonably large and are an active species, so a spacious aquarium that allows room for both ample live rock and a decent swimming space along the front of the tank is requisite. Ideally, these peaceful species will be maintained in small groups, as it prefer to live in aggregations - intraspecific aggression should not be an issue here. It is best to try and obtain medium-sized specimens of between 7.5 and 12.5cm in length,as these always adapt to aquarium life much more readily than those that are very small or very large. If planning on adding a group (and this is best for their long-term well-being), try to obtain specimens that are all of roughly equal sizes, and add all to the tank simultaneously. They should be the only butterflyfish species in the aquarium, and if at all possible, tankmates should be of similar size and temperament. Any fish that could be considered as mildly aggressive should be added after the Zoster Butterflyfish have established their territories, and only if the tank offers sufficient space and ample visual barriers amongst the rockwork. Never try to house these fish with boisterous feeders as they are likely to intimidate the butterflies at feeding time. Ensure that the water is thoroughly filtered and well-oxygenated, and provide areas of brisk current. As with all butterflyfishes, they are always going to be much less likely to pick on coral sand other invertebrates if they are well fed and given plenty of space and distractions. This species is also known as the Black Pyramid Butterflyfish or Brown & White Butterflyfish. The intensity of the brown-black areas on this fish can vary depending on the mood, time of day etc. It is replaced by the yellow and white Pyramid Butterflyfish (H.polylepsis) at Christmas and Cocos-Keeling Islands.',feeding:"Offer a variety of tiny and small frozen foods, in small amounts several times per day e.g. plankton, baby brine shrimp (Artemia nauplii),vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, Mysis shrimp, Angel & Butterfly Mix, and finely chopped krill.
