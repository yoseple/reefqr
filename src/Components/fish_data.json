        "care": "The Achilles Tang is a striking-looking fish known from clear seaward reefs and surge zones where it is usually observed in groups, feeding on filamentous and fleshy algae. However, this attractive, sought-after fish is one of the more demanding members of the Acanthurus genus and is suitable for advanced aquarists only. The aquarium must be spacious, mature, have a vigorous water flow, and contain plenty of live rock which the Achilles Tang will enjoy grazing upon. Include plenty of hiding places that are large enough for your fish to retreat into quickly should it feel threatened, at the same time aiming for an aquascape that allows plenty of open swimming space along the front of the aquarium for such a powerful swimmer. Achilles Tangs are not usually overly aggressive towards tankmates (although rogue specimens have been known), however they will show much hostility towards their own kind and towards other tangs - particularly other members of the Acanthurus genus - so for this reason it is best to house just one specimen per tank and not with any other tangs. It is recommended that the Achilles Tang is the last addition to a set up, as it can be a little territorial to newcomers, especially similar fish species. It is best to source a medium sized specimen (i.e. over 4\" in length) as they are more likely to acclimatise well to life in captivity. Conversely, extra large specimens may have a difficult time settling in, so aim for a healthy-looking fish that is neither too small nor excessively large. Avoid any specimens that appear \"pinched\" in the belly area, and do ask your retailer to show you that your chosen fish is feeding well prior to purchase. Achilles Tangs have a high metabolism and require small frequent feeds throughout the day. Powerful filtration/circulation and a high level of oxygenation are therefore essential for this energetic, voracious eater. Be sure to keep on top of water quality as this fish will not tolerate deteriorating water conditions. A large refugium with living rock can be most useful: macroalgae can be cultured on this rock and these pieces rotated with pieces from the main tank, so that the Achilles Tang has a continual supply of natural foodstuffs to graze upon. Take care when handling this species, as the caudal spines are large and can inflict a very painful wound. A period of quarantine can be a valuable procedure for the acclimatisation of all livestock, and it is of particular importance for the Achilles Tang which can be fairly susceptible to developing marine whitespot. This can be difficult to treat in the reef aquarium. Ideally the fish should be quarantined and carefully observed in a separate aquarium for at least a fortnight before being introduced into your main display tank. May also be seen on sale as the Red Tail Tang. Juvenile fish display an orange caudal peduncle spine; the large orange teardrop marking in this area appearing as the fish mature. In the wild, the Achilles Tang has been known to hybridise with the Gold Rim Tang (A. nigricans). ***Prior to purchase, please bear in mind that the Achilles Tang is a very demanding species that requires an aquarium planned around its well-being; the tang should be made the centrepiece of the tank, with all the other variables worked around to suit its specific needs. Experienced aquarists only***",
        "feeding": "Feed a varied diet for omnivores, with a large vegetable component, in small amounts several times per day.

Adding a specially formulated vitamin supplement to any frozen foods will be beneficial.",

An imposing, large-growing species, the Addis Butterflyfish is best suited to very spacious, mature aquaria with an abundance of live rock for the fish to browse upon and forage amongst, together with a roomy swimming space along the front of the tank. Unfortunately, all stony corals, many soft corals and a whole host of other invertebrates will be picked at and eaten, but some of the more noxious soft corals are usually safe if the butterflyfish is kept well fed. As with all butterflies, this species demands excellent water quality at all times - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of brisk current. Addis Butterflyfish are relatively peaceful and are best maintained in groups of 5 or more, added simultaneously, and preferably with all being of similar size to one another; bearing in mind that juvenile fish tend to acclimatise more readily than larger adults. Tankmates should be of similar size and temperament. Avoid housing with other species of butterflyfish as territorial issues are likely to arise.

        "care": "The African Blenny, also known as the African Fang Blenny, is found at coral reefs with poor to moderate coral growth, often over coral rubble. Whilst many of the Fang or Sabre-Toothed Blennies are known to parasitize other fish, those from the Meiacanthus genus (of which 28 species have been formerly described) feed only on zooplankton as they hover in the water column, and on tiny benthic invertebrates they find on the reef. Juvenile African Blennies tend to gather in small groups, whereas the adults are solitary or seen in pairs. Meiacanthus species tend to be quite inoffensive, but they do possess two venomous canine-like teeth in the lower jaw that can be employed should they be attacked. Most fish know to leave them alone, but if they are ingested, a quick, sharp bite on the inside of the predator\"\u2122s mouth from the blenny ensures that it is spat out again \"\u201c and it is usually none the worse for wear. These fish do not employ their weaponry in an active manner, instead they use it only as a last resort to defend themselves or their territory. Whilst African Blennies can sometimes be a little secretive, they are generally far more self-assured than other blenniids (most likely due to the possession of such potent defensive apparatus) and will often be seen hovering about in the water column above the rockwork in an inquisitive manner. Provide the African Blenny with a mature tank that contains an abundance of live rock, so that it may continually graze upon it for small crustaceans; without such quantity of well-established rockwork, these fish will not fare very well. It is best to keep just one specimen per tank, unless you can acquire a known mated pair, as these fish can be a little territorial in the confines of the average aquarium. Will cohabit with most species, except for close relatives and much larger carnivorous fish. Ensure that the tank has tight fitting coverslides as these fish are expert jumpers. Please be aware that whilst the bites of Fang Blennies are not usually dangerous to most people, they can be very painful. Therefore some degree of caution is required when carrying out maintenance in the aquarium, taking particular care not to intrude too closely upon their territory. Never try to hand feed a Fang Blenny. May also be seen on sale as the Mozambique Fang Blenny.",
        "feeding": "Offer a varied diet including meaty items and herbivore rations. Mysis shrimp, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, zooplankton, and finely chopped finely shaved krill/prawns/mussel/cockle etc. should all be taken with much enthusiasm.

This is a fish that has an appetite for pest anemones (Aiptasia spp.) but in the wild, feeds primarily on amphipods, molluscs, and polychaetes, along with some plant matter. These well-camouflaged fish will indeed eat Aiptasia, but older specimens may also pick on coral polyps, and for this reason they are not considered totally reef safe. However, in a vast system with an abundance of fast-growing corals, and if the fish are kept well-fed, this may not be so much of an issue. In smaller quarters though, they are more suited to a fish-only set-up. A safer option for the natural eradication of Aiptasia in reef aquaria would be Peppermint Shrimps (Lysmata wurdemanni). A. tomentosus is a shy, peaceful species that can be kept alongside other fish of similar size and temperament but may lose out to more aggressive feeders in some communities. Tank bred fish are offered with increasing regularity and are often reared from an early age on a diet that features nuisance anemones to ensure they recognise these as food.",

However, these are very personable fish and are fascinating to observe, regardless of their excellent ability at removing and consuming algae. The tank must be well established, and of a good size; algae blennies have been known to starve in smaller quarters once the main food source has been depleted and not had time to re-establish. When algae blennies feed, skip over rocks, graze decor and generally go about their business, they tend to stir up detritus where it goes into suspension and is then removed by the filtration. As this species requires a mature tank, it works out well that this should be amongst the last fish added to the tank, preferably at a size around 5cm, where it should not be over-dominant. Algae blennies can be fairly feisty and quite territorial over their favoured parts of the aquarium, particularly as they mature; therefore it is best to keep only one per tank, and careful consideration should be given to tankmates - avoiding other blennies unless you are blessed with a tank of vast proportions incorporating a huge number of visual barriers amongst the rockwork, and more than enough food to go round on a continual basis. It should be noted that algae blennies will not feed on every kind of algae - they particularly relish the filamentous type, but will ignore bubble and slime algae. Ensure corals are firmly attached, as large algae blennies may disturb them with their feeding habits and when hopping about looking for a suitable perch from which they can survey their domain.",

The Annularis Angelfish is large-growing, active species which requires a voluminous aquarium. It is also rather territorial so provide plenty of live rockwork that has a multitude of visual barriers and bolt holes, as well as a roomy swimming space along the front of the tank. Keep only one specimen per tank, and not with any other angelfish. Tankmates should be equally large and belligerent - this species should never be kept with invertebrates or small, passive fish. The aquarium should be well filtered, as these fish are voracious eaters, and there should be areas of decent current and good levels of oxygenation. If your angelfish isn't provided with adequate space, it will behave much more aggressively. Annularis Angelfish feed on many sessile invertebrates in the wild, including sponges, stony corals, soft corals, and tunicates, so it is not a reef safe species. We recommend that the Annularis Angelfish is the last addition to an aquarium, as otherwise it can behave somewhat pugnaciously when introducing new tankmates into what it perceives as its established domain. Having said this, it is not uncommon for this fish to behave quite shyly when first introduced to its new surroundings/tankmates, but given the right environment, it will quickly gain much confidence and venture out into the open water areas. Juvenile fish look very different to the adults: young fish are dark-blue/black with white and cyan vertical, slightly curved stripes, whereas adults are generally a golden brown colour (sometimes almost a dusky yellow) with the most striking sapphire blue up-curved markings. The alternative common name, Blue Ringed Angelfish, is derived from the bright blue ringed eyespot adult fish display above the gill cover.

The eggs should hatch within 3-6 days (temperature dependent) and they remain in a larval state for around 30 days. As soon as the eggs hatch, parental care ceases, so you will need to separate the young from the parents and any other fish in the tank just prior to this event. Raising the larvae to adult fish is possible, but very challenging - you will need a ready supply of miniscule foodstuffs such as rotifers available at all times and water quality/tank hygiene must be continually monitored.

Unfortunately, Asfur Angels will nip at LPS corals, some soft corals such as Xenia sp., and also clam mantles. However, most SPS corals and some of the more noxious soft corals are usually ignored, particularly if the fish is kept well fed. Filtration should be oversized, with highly efficient protein skimming and powerful circulation. As with many large angelfish species, the juvenile pattern is entirely different to that of the adult fish. Juveniles are a royal blue colour with pale blue and white lightly curved vertical stripes; whereas adults are a dark blue-grey/black with a dazzling yellow crescent shaped sash on each flank, along with a vivid yellow tail. As the fish mature, the tips of the dorsal and anal fin elongate into streamers that trail behind the fish as it swims. The body colour and pattern of adults are similar to that of the Halfmoon/Yellowbar/Red Sea Angelfish (P. maculosus), but they are told apart by the Asfur Angelfish sporting a bright yellow tail (vs. white/colourless in P. maculosus). May also be seen on sale as Arabian Angelfish or Crescent Angelfish.",

        "care": "The Bandit Angelfish is known from Hawaii and the Johnston Atoll, where it is found at current-swept rocky and coral reefs, close to ledges, overhangs, and caves. They are usually observed at depths between 12-50m (39-164ft) feeding on sponges and tunicates, but a number of individuals have been observed from submarines at depths as far down as 183m (600ft). This striking angelfish - with its pearly white body and bold black bar running across the upper side from the front of the eye to the posterior of the dorsal fin, and a similar broad black band running sub-marginally on the caudal and anal fins - is rarely seen in the trade, and as such, tends to command a hefty price tag when it is available. This is a challenging fish to keep in the home aquarium because of its specialised feeding requirements, and an ongoing source of frozen sponge-based Angelfish rations is requisite in its long term care. Bandit Angelfish will always fare best in spacious, mature aquaria with an abundance of live rock and an open swimming space along the front of the tank. Established systems will provide much more in the way of nutritious micro-invertebrates in the living rock and this will help to supplement the specialised diet. In smaller systems, such critters will be quickly depleted, which is why it is doubly important that this active fish is given ample space. Bandit Angelfish demand excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of decent current. Keep only one per tank, and not with any other angelfish. If you have your heart set on one of these beautiful fish and can meet all its requirements, it is best to try and acquire a smaller specimen as these have the best record of acclimatising well to the home aquarium. When first introduced, it may be quite shy and spend some time hiding amongst the rockwork, but it will soon gain confidence as it settles in and grows. Do not house with prized corals and sponges, as these will be eaten (see Reef Aquarium Compatibility below). May also be seen on sale as the Black-banded Angelfish or Banded Angelfish. Captive bred specimens are sometimes available. Not suitable for beginners.",

        "care": "The elegant Banggai Cardinalfish is known only from the Banggai Islands, an archipelago located off the far eastern coast of central Sulawesi (Celebes). These graceful, nocturnal fish are typically found dwelling amongst silty seagrass beds, sea anemones, mangrove roots, and coral ledges by day. Youngsters in particular are closely associated with the long-spined sea urchin Diadema setosum, where they will retreat amongst its spines for protection when threatened. At night, these fish feed on small benthic and planktonic crustaceans, in groups that sometimes number up to 200 specimens. In the home aquarium, it is important to provide a spacious reef setting with plenty of shady overhangs, nooks, and crannies. Just as essential is maintaining Banggai Cardinalfish in good sized groups (8+) due to their gregarious nature. Try to obtain fish that are the same size and add all simultaneously. Occasional minor scuffles may occur - usually consisting of chasing, nudging, and fin-flicking - but no real harm should ensue providing there is sufficient space and plenty of visual barriers amongst the decor. However, problems will arise if the group is too small and if the tank lacks space. In smaller set ups, it is best to house a known male-female pair only. Although tank bred specimens are considered relatively hardy, water quality should not be neglected; good filtration is a must and brisk water movement will be much appreciated. Tankmates can include other small, peaceful fish, even other cardinalfish species. Do avoid anything large and boisterous as cardinalfish are easily intimidated and may refuse to come out and feed. Also, be aware that although Banggai Cardinalfish are very placid, they are actually micropredators; therefore small shrimp and very tiny fish may be viewed as food items by larger specimens. Wild Banggai Cardinalfish are currently listed as \"Endangered\" on the IUCN redlist of threatened species. Thankfully, however, their readiness to reproduce in the aquarium has enabled breeding for the aquatics trade on a large scale. It is important that we, as conscientious aquarists, act responsibly and source captive bred Banggai Cardinalfish wherever possible, to help safeguard the very limited wild population.",
        "feeding": "Offer a variety of meaty items such as Mysis shrimp, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, finely chopped krill/cockle/clam meat etc. Feed small amounts 3 times per day, with at least one of the feeds after lights out.",
        "breeding": "These fish breed readily in the home aquarium. When ready to spawn, courtship behaviour - usually initiated by the female - which consists of the pair swimming alongside each other nudging/trembling near the vent area, and the darkening of the males lower jaw, will take place for quite some time prior to the female releasing her eggs in close proximity to the male, near the bottom of the tank. The male fertilises the eggs (usually numbering up to 60) very quickly and immediately takes them up into his mouth for incubation. The eggs are quite large, at approximately 2.5mm in diameter and will make the males mouth appear a little distended. It is not uncommon for the female to aggressively protect the male when he is mouthbrooding. This is another reason why it is important to give these fish adequate space. The eggs/young will remain within the mouth of the male fish for some time; indeed, the eggs usually take around 20 days to hatch (temperature dependent) and after a further 10 days, when the young are more developed and grown to approx 6-7mm, they are released. During this month-long period, the male fish will not eat and attends to the brood by regularly turning them in his mouth and expelling any that have died. Once he releases the young, the male does not interact with them. There should be suitable shelter for the fry, amongst branching corals and long spined sea urchins."

Provide plenty of shady crevices and overhangs amongst the live rock so that these deeper water fish feel secure. Over time, they can become accustomed to brighter lighting, but they should be exposed to more intense illumination very gradually - this is why, when initially introduced, it is so important to provide plenty of refuges from the illumination of the average well-lit reef aquarium. A varied diet is a must to keep the fish in good health and for them to display their vibrant colouration. Ideally they will be fed small amounts several times per day (see below). Powerful filtration and protein skimming, plus a good maintenance regime are essential for maintaining optimal water quality despite the heavy nutrient input. As these fish inhabit areas of great tidal surge in the wild, they require vigorous water movement in the home aquarium - a high level of oxygenation at all times being of utmost importance.",
        "feeding": "In the wild, this species is constantly on the lookout for food, taking zooplankton from the water column. Due to their fast metabolism, they require feeding in small amounts several times per day (i.e. at least 4 times) if they are to maintain good health. Offer a variety of fine meaty foodstuffs such as Mysis shrimp, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, finely chopped krill/prawns etc in addition to zooplankton preparations (containing copepods and rotifers) which are often available in either frozen or refrigerated forms. Many will also take dried foods in time. Foods rich in carotenoids will help them to maintain good colours.",

They are also found in lagoons and channels, but are much less abundant in such areas. These fishes are primarily black with a white caudal peduncle and caudal fin. The tail develops pretty double filaments to each tip. In an aquarium situation, Bicolour Chromis must be provided with a reef environment with plenty of nooks and crannies amongst the rockwork. Tankmates should be of a moderately peaceable nature, as unlike many other members of the damselfish family, these remain a relatively quiet species into adulthood. However,  they will show territorial aggression towards other Pomacentrid (damselfish) species so avoid housing them with other damsels unless you are blessed with a system of vast proportions. In an average sized aquarium housing a shoal of Bicolour Chromis, they should be considered the focal point of the tank and dominant, open water species such as large angelfish or tangs should be avoided if the Chromis are to flourish. It is best to keep Bicolour Chromis in groups of 6 or more due to their shoaling nature. The tank should be well mature before adding these fish, and the entire group should be introduced simultaneously. May also be seen on sale as Black and White Chromis.

These fish are normally observed in pairs, feeding on tiny invertebrate life amongst the nooks and crannies with their extraordinary long snouts. The aquarium should be mature and should offer plenty of live rock for both grazing opportunities and sanctuary, as well as ample swimming space. There should be good filtration and areas of brisk water movement. The Big Longnose Butterflyfish should be kept singly as it will show much aggression towards its own kind and other butterflyfish species (the only exception to this rule is if a true mated pair can be obtained). It is best housed with other peaceful tankmates so that it does not feel intimidated when feeding. A dark brown colour morph from Hawaii is sometimes available, although they may not always retain the unusual colouration in captivity - many specimens apparently reverting to the normal yellow and, on occasion, back to brown again. A similar species, the Yellow Longnose Butterflyfish (F. flavissimus) is also often seen in the trade \" this fish has a shorter snout, and a slightly larger mouth, than that of F. longirostris. The Yellow Longnose Butterflyfish also has a higher dorsal spine count (12-13) compared to the Big Longnose (10-11). Feeding may be a little challenging on account of the tiny mouth - do ensure all foodstuffs are small enough for the butterflyfish to consume. Aquarists often have the greatest success in keeping this fish in tip-top condition when an ongoing supply of tiny amphipods and copepods are cultured in an attached fishless refugium - the butterflyfish will devour these with much enthusiasm. The Big Longnose Butterflyfish makes for a wonderful addition to the mature reef aquarium, but your success with this species very much depends on the provision of a suitably spacious, current-swept rocky reef with friendly companions, in addition to ample and varied feedings.",

        "care": "The Bignose Unicornfish is known from deep lagoons and seaward reefs, to depths of 50m (164ft). Here they may be found forming loose aggregations in the mid to upper reaches of steep drop offs, feeding on zooplankton and various marine plants and algae. Juvenile fish are mostly grey with a few bright blue spots distributed over the flanks and tail, along with blue lips. Adults are very imposing fish - they develop a convexly rounded, prominent snout (this being much less of a 'horn' than is seen in the majority of unicornfish), vertical blue lines that break up into small blue spots dorsally, in addition to a broad blue band extending from underneath the eye to the front of the rostral protuberance, and long flowing caudal streamers. Interestingly, these fish have the ability to show or hide their vivid blue markings, depending on mood. The Bignose Unicornfish is a very active, semi-aggressive acanthurid that requires a great deal of swimming space. Adults have been known to grow to almost two feet long, including the long flowing tail filaments. If you are blessed with a system of enormous proportions, the Bignose Unicornfish could make a wonderful centrepiece. The tank should contain plenty of live rock which this fish will enjoy grazing upon. Include plenty of hiding places that are large enough for the Bignose Unicornfish to retreat into quickly should it feel threatened, at the same time aiming for an aquascape that allows plenty of open swimming space along the front of the aquarium for such a powerful swimmer. Bignose Unicornfish are moderately aggressive towards tankmates, especially their own kind; for this reason it is best to house just one specimen per tank. There are good reports of this fish mixing with tangs of other genera; however it is recommended that the Bignose Unicornfish is the last addition to a set up, as it can be rather territorial to newcomers, especially similar fish species. It is best to source a medium sized specimen (i.e. over 4\" in length) as they are more likely to acclimatise well to life in captivity. Conversely, extra large specimens may have a difficult time settling in, so aim for a healthy-looking fish that is neither too small nor excessively large. Avoid any specimens that appear \"pinched\" in the belly area, and do ask your retailer to show you that your chosen fish is feeding well prior to purchase. Bignose Unicornfish have a high metabolism and require small frequent feeds throughout the day. Powerful filtration/vigorous circulation and a high level of oxygenation are therefore essential for this energetic, voracious eater. Be sure to keep on top of water quality as this fish will not tolerate deteriorating water conditions. A large refugium with living rock can be most useful: macroalgae can be cultured on this rock and these pieces rotated with pieces from the main tank, so that the Bignose Unicornfish has a continual supply of natural foodstuffs to graze upon. Take care when handling Bignose Unicornfish, as their caudal spines (2 on each side of the caudal peduncle) are particularly large and can inflict very painful wounds. A period of quarantine can be a valuable procedure for the acclimatisation of all livestock, and it is of particular importance for the Bignose Unicornfish which can be fairly susceptible to developing marine whitespot. This can be difficult to treat in the reef aquarium. Ideally the fish should be quarantined and carefully observed in a separate aquarium for at least a fortnight before being introduced into your main display tank. May also be on sale as Scribbled Unicornfish, Vlamingii Tang, or Vlaming's Unicornfish.",
        "feeding": "Offer a varied diet, consisting of mostly vegetable matter, in small amounts 3 times per day. In the wild, Bignose Unicornfish mainly consume various benthic algae and plants (including Cladophora spp. , Dictyota spp., Jania spp., Laurencia spp., Padina spp., and Turbinaria spp.) and planktonic meaty fare. Although this species will browse on some algae within the aquarium, it is of utmost importance to supplement the diet with a variety of foods including frozen herbivore rations, dried marine algae/Nori, green marine flake, Spirulina (blue-green algae), Spirulina-enriched brineshrimp, cucumber, lettuce etc. Include occasional feedings of Mysis shrimp and finely chopped krill.

Here this unusual-looking 'beaked' wrasse feeds on small benthic crustaceans, brittle stars, molluscs, and small fishes. The Birdmouth Wrasse is hardy and easy to keep, but a spacious aquarium is a necessity, as they are active, grow large, and are powerful (albeit rather jerky) swimmers. Ideally, there will also be ample rockwork to provide plenty of nooks and crannies to explore, plus an open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. A deep substrate is not required, as this species does not bury in the substrate after dark. Provide clean, well oxygenated water with areas of fast current. Tight fitting coverslides are also essential, as these fish are expert jumpers. This is a fairly boisterous wrasse that should only be kept alongside fish of similar size and temperament; smaller fish will be shown much aggression and are likely to be eaten. In the wild, the Birdmouth Wrasse snatches smaller fish in its beak and bashes them against the substrate until it breaks up into bite sized pieces. Tankmates must, therefore, be chosen with much caution. Keep only one male per tank, and, if a pair is desired, add the female and male simultaneously, or else add the female first. If two or more females are introduced to the tank (simultaneously) with no males present, one of the females will begin to change into a male. The aquarium must be of XXL proportions if such a group is to be kept successfully. Whilst the adults of this species can be readily recognised by the characteristic beak-like snout, juveniles may be more difficult to identify, as they do not develop the elongated nose until they are more mature. Like other wrasses, this species is a protogynous sequential hermaphrodite, which means that all fish are born as females and are able to change sex to male, but not back again. The largest fish in a group will be a dominant male, while the smaller fish remain female. If the dominant male dies, the largest female changes sex and takes his place. Male fish can be identified by their vivid emerald green colouration and larger size, compared to the muted browns of the female fish. The Birdmouth Wrasse (G. varius) is sometimes confused with its close relative G. caeruleus, but can be told apart by its slightly different colour pattern and geographical range; however, some experts believe the two are in fact the same species, just with geographical colour differences, but further research is needed. Interestingly, two natural hybrids have been documented. The first is with the Moon Wrasse (Thalassoma lunare) from Cassini Island, Western Australia and the Great Barrier Reef; and the second is with the Saddle Wrasse (T. duperrey) in Hawaii. May also be seen on sale as Birdface Wrasse, Birdnose Wrasse, Bird Wrasse, or Brown/Green Bird Wrasse.",

Here these striking fish are encountered at coral-rich and algae-covered sheltered inner reefs/lagoons, and occasionally estuaries, to depths of 20m (66ft). Juvenile fish tend to prefer the sanctuary of protected inner reef areas, whereas the adults are habitually observed singly or in pairs (and very occasionally in large aggregations) out on the reef, feeding on algae, coral polyps, and small benthic invertebrates. This species is seldom seen in the trade and is regarded as moderately difficult to keep in the home aquarium. It is therefore recommended for advanced aquarists only. A good-sized, mature system is requisite, along with ample live rock for the fish to browse upon/hide amongst and a large open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Medium sized specimens tend to acclimatise better to aquarium life, adapting much more quickly to various prepared foods, so try to choose a healthy, alert specimen around 10cm (3.9\") in length. Smaller fish may be very reluctant to feed, and larger specimens can be incredibly finicky, requiring faultless water conditions and an abundance of live food. An aquarium that has some areas of lush filamentous algae growth will also aid your new fish in settling into its new surroundings; however, as with other butterflyfish species, these fish demand excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of brisk current. Some aquarists have successfully kept the Black Butterflyfish alongside some of the more noxious soft corals, but this is something of a risk, and they should be observed carefully. Most corals and motile invertebrates will be constantly nipped at, so unfortunately are best avoided. Keep only one Black Butterflyfish per tank (unless a mated pair is acquired) and not with any other butterflyfish as they will squabble over territories. Whilst they can be rather shy when first introduced, providing them with ample retreats amongst the live rock should ensure they eventually gain confidence and venture out into the open much more. Tankmates should be of similar size and temperament; it is imperative that boisterous companions are avoided if this fish is to settle in and feed.

        "care": "The Black Leopard Wrasse is one of 11 currently known species of Macropharyngodon, and although all are incredibly beautiful, this genera is considered very delicate and does have some specialist care requirements that must be fulfilled by the advanced aquarist if these fish are to acclimatise well to life in captivity. In the wild, the Black Leopard Wrasse is known from lagoons and seaward reefs to depths of 32m (105ft). Here they may be observed in pairs or small, loose aggregations, swimming close to the substrate, whilst browsing for gastropods and foraminiferans. When approached, they move up and down in an unusual way to confuse possible predators. This leopard wrasse requires a very mature, spacious aquarium with plenty of live rock and sand that supports its natural diet on an ongoing basis, if it is to thrive. If added to a newly set up tank, it will starve to death. There should be plenty of hiding places amongst the rockwork, with enough depth of substrate (7.5cm/3\"\u009d of fine sand) for the fish to bury if it feels threatened. Because of the difficulties in feeding this leopard wrasse, it should not be kept with fish that require a similar food source to survive, as otherwise one species may out-compete the other. There should be relatively calm areas in the tank that allow it to locate food successfully. Tankmates should be peaceful and of an easygoing nature so that the Black Leopard Wrasse does not feel harassed and subsequently stops venturing out to feed. Groups can sometimes be kept together successfully (added simultaneously) but larger numbers should only ever be considered for exceptionally large aquaria, as in the average sized aquarium, natural prey will deplete too quickly with that many fish requiring the same diet. Do not house with other Macropharyngodon species or pugnacious dottybacks and hawkfish, as they will fight for territory. When choosing your leopard wrasse, check that its body is not emaciated, and that it is actively searching for food. It is not uncommon for a newly added leopard wrasse to hide beneath the substrate whilst it adjusts to its new surroundings and altered circadian rhythm; in such cases it is best to leave them be, they will usually begin to explore within a couple of days. These fish require stable and optimal water conditions at all times, so a good filtration and maintenance regime is a must. Ensure that the aquarium has tight fitting coverslides with no small gaps in the hood, as these fish are expert jumpers. May also be seen on sale as Yellowspotted Wrasse.

Due to the remoteness of export origin, these tangs are rarely seen in the trade and tend to command a high price when they are available. This fish is similar in appearance to the Scopas Tang (Z. scopas), and in the wild where their ranges overlap, hybrids between the two occur. The Black Tang should be provided with a generously sized tank, as ample swimming space is required, and specimens kept in smaller quarters can become quite aggressive. It is best to keep to just this one species of Zebrasoma in the aquarium, as they don't often accept other members of the same genus. Other tangs from different genera (such as the Regal Tang or Lipstick Tang) with a visibly different appearance may be accepted if the fish are added simultaneously. The tank should be mature with plenty of algal growth for these herbivores to browse. It is of utmost importance that they receive an appropriate diet consisting of a variety of greenfoods, in order to prevent Head & Lateral Line Erosion (HHLE). As long as this fish is kept well fed, it should not pose any problems in a reef set up. Occasional specimens have been known to nip at stony corals, and even some soft corals, but this is not the norm. A decent current and highly oxygenated conditions will serve this fish well. Provide plenty of hiding/sleeping places amongst the rockwork, with an open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. May also be seen on sale as the Black Longnose Tang or Black Sailfin Tang. This fish is seldom available, but well worth looking out for as an impressive centrepiece to complete a large display. Recommended for experienced aquarists only.",

Juveniles are often observed on deeper rubble slopes with rich invertebrate growth. This species is well suited to peaceful established aquaria with plenty of living rock. Angelfish from the Chaetodontoplus genus are not seen in the trade all that regularly, and many species are highly prized amongst serious hobbyists. The Black Velvet Angelfish, as the common name suggests, is predominantly black but with a variable-sized splash of grey on the face and the anterior upper half of the body. The top of the head is adorned with orange-yellow markings, and the tail and posterior of the dorsal and the anal fin are bright yellow. Juvenile fish sport a pale yellow curved bar just behind the eye and over the gill cover, and the yellow accents on the dorsal and anal fins are much bolder. Tankmates must be chosen carefully as this fish will be reluctant to feed if there is competition from boisterous or aggressive species. Keep only one Black Velvet Angelfish per tank, and not with any other angelfish. The more hiding places within the tank, the more likely it will be that this fish will feel safe enough to swim out and about in full view whilst browsing on the aquarium decor for filamentous algae and diatoms. Caution is advised when adding the Black Velvet Angelfish to reef aquaria, as selected invertebrates may be nipped at; success is more likely in XXL reef systems where the fish is less likely to cause such irreparable damage, although there are absolutely no guarantees. This species is better suited to a fish-only with live rock system, which has been set up to house and meet the needs of shy, peaceful fish only.

Here they occur singly or in large aggregations, feeding on filamentous algae growing from the reef structures. Although apparently rather abundant in its natural habitat, this highly sought-after fish is rarely seen in the trade, and as such, tends to command a very high price tag when it is available. These striking fish sport 12 dark vertical bars on the silvery body (4 on the head, 6 on the flanks beneath the dorsal fin - which are notably broader dorsally than ventrally, and 2 on the caudal peduncle) along with several dark spots or blotches on the anterior ventral region, and a sharp spine on the caudal peduncle. This semi-aggressive, active species attains a good size and can be rather territorial, so a spacious aquarium is therefore required. It is usually best to keep only one per tank, unless the system is vast and there is an abundance of visual barriers. If you wish to keep other tangs in the same tank, it is best to opt for Ctenochaetus, Naso, or Zebrasoma species - added simultaneously - as these will be best tolerated by the Black-barred Tang, rather than other fish from the same genus (Acanthurus). However, personalities do vary between individuals, so observe your fish very carefully to ensure that there are no problems. Generally speaking, this fish is safe in reef aquaria, although occasional specimens have been known to nip at LPS corals if underfed. The Black-barred Tang will actively browse on filamentous algae growing on the decor, so a mature tank is essential for its wellbeing. Arrange the live rock to create a sloping reef, with plenty of boltholes for the fish, Be sure to leave a large open swimming area along the front of the aquarium. Vigorous filtration and circulation is a must for this energetic, voracious eater. Take care when handling, as the caudal spines can inflict a painful wound.

There is a lunar periodicity to the spawning, mostly occurring in the period from 12 days before to 2 days after a full moon. The pelagic eggs are spherical and average just 0.68mm in diameter. Hatching occurs after 26 hours and feeding commences around 5-6 days later, the young remaining in a larval state for some 2.5 months. Juveniles averaging about 25mm in length (and which are orbicular, scaleless, and transparent - except for a light silvery sheen) seek out the shelter of shallow tide pools and reef flats."

Adults have been known to grow to a foot and a half, and that is not taking into account the long flowing tail filaments of the males. If you are blessed with a system of enormous proportions, the Blonde Lipstick Tang could make a wonderful centrepiece. The tank should contain plenty of live rock which this fish will enjoy grazing upon. Include plenty of hiding places that are large enough for the Blonde Lipstick Tang to retreat into quickly should it feel threatened, at the same time aiming for an aquascape that allows plenty of open swimming space along the front of the aquarium for such a powerful swimmer. Blonde Lipstick Tangs are not overly aggressive towards tankmates, except their own kind; for this reason it is best to house just one specimen per tank. There are good reports of this fish mixing with tangs of other genera; however it is recommended that the Blonde Lipstick Tang is the last addition to a set up, as it can be a little territorial to newcomers, especially similar fish species. It is best to source a medium sized specimen (i.e. over 4\" in length) as they are more likely to acclimatise well to life in captivity. Conversely, extra large specimens may have a difficult time settling in, so aim for a healthy-looking fish that is neither too small nor excessively large. Avoid any specimens that appear \"pinched\" in the belly area, and do ask your retailer to show you that your chosen fish is feeding well prior to purchase. Blonde Lipstick Tangs have a high metabolism and require small frequent feeds throughout the day. Powerful filtration/circulation and a high level of oxygenation are therefore essential for this energetic, voracious eater. Be sure to keep on top of water quality as this fish will not tolerate deteriorating water conditions. A large refugium with living rock can be most useful: macroalgae can be cultured on this rock and these pieces rotated with pieces from the main tank, so that the Blonde Lipstick Tang has a continual supply of natural foodstuffs to graze upon. Take care when handling Blonde Lipstick Tangs, as their caudal spines are particularly large and can inflict a very painful wound. A period of quarantine can be a valuable procedure for the acclimatisation of all livestock, and it is of particular importance for the Blonde Lipstick Tang which can be fairly susceptible to developing marine whitespot. This can be difficult to treat in the reef aquarium. Ideally the fish should be quarantined and carefully observed in a separate aquarium for at least a fortnight before being introduced into your main display tank.

        "care": "The Blue Neon Goby is a charming little fish that makes a wonderful addition to the reef aquarium. In the wild,this hardy species is found amongst coral heads at depths up to 45 meters. Brightly colored and peaceful, Blue Neon Gobies also readily reproduce in captivity, which makes for a very interesting breeding project. Blue Neon Gobies are regularly observed servicing fish that have ectoparasites, helping to control diseases such as Lymphocystis and marine white spot. An advantage over most other cleaner fishes is that the Blue Neon Goby is not an \"obligate cleaner\" (i.e.it does not rely on cleaning/eating parasites for optimal health). As such, it will do just as well in a healthy aquarium where it is offered quality commercially prepared foodstuffs. This diminutive goby rarely shows aggression towards other species, although it will fight with members of its own kind, especially in smaller aquaria where space and territories are more limited. Large groups (7+) can be kept if the system is spacious; however smaller aquaria it is advisable to keep either a single specimen or a known mated pair. Although these gobies cannot be sexed externally, it is often fairly easy to pick out a compatible pair at your local aquarium store as they may have paired off and be resting very close to one another. With regards to compatibility, Blue Neon Gobies are ideal for community reef aquaria; they are also often purported to coexist with a number of unlikely large predators, which usually tend to leave the gobies alone on account of their known cleaning services. However, much caution is necessary as all fish vary in personality and temperament and there can be no guarantees when it comes to their safety with such tankmates present. Observe carefully and if in any doubt, do not add them to your aquarium. It is not advisable to add Blue Neon Gobies to an aquarium containing predatory crabs. These fish are often available as captive-bred specimens, which assists with the sustainability of wild populations.",
        "feeding": "Will consume a wide range of meaty fare including Mysis shrimp, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, finely shaved krill/prawns etc. Feed small amounts 3 times per day.",
        "breeding": "Blue Neon Gobies have been bred successfully both on a commercial basis and in the home aquarium. These fish always form distinct pairs when spawning. Demersal eggs will be laid on a variety of substrates/decor and cared for by the parents. If you wish to raise a larger number of fry, offer the pair a spawning medium such as a short section of small-diameter pvc pipe, and once the eggs have been laid/fertilised, the pipe and eggs can be carefully moved to a separate aquarium (with identical water conditions) where they will be safe from predation. You will need to ensure that the eggs are very gently aerated in the absence of the parent fish. The time it takes for the eggs to hatch will vary depending on water temperature and other factors, but on average this is usually around 8 days. The larvae can be fed on zooplankton and small rotifers,moving on to larger foodstuffs (such as baby brineshrimp) as they grow and metamorphose into small versions of the adults."

        "care": "The beautiful Blue Spotted Jawfish is native to the sandy bays of the Gulf of California (also known as the Sea of Cortez), at depths between 9-27m (30-90ft). The waters in this area are somewhat colder than the waters where most popular tropical marine fish are collected, and this must be taken into account if planning to keep this species in the home aquarium; a means of chilling the water will certainly be necessary throughout the warmer months. Blue Spotted Jawfish make a fascinating addition to mature reef aquaria, providing that a few key requirements (including the aforementioned low water temperature) are met. These industrious bottom dwellers need a mixed substrate that is at least 10cm (3.9\") deep. Ideally this will be comprised of 75% coral sand, and 25% small pieces of reef rubble (varying from approx. 0.5cm to 1.5cm in diameter). This will allow to the fish to construct a burrow, in which it will spend much time resting just inside the entrance, seemingly watching the world go by and waiting for food morsels to drift past overhead. At other times it will be busy rearranging things in and around its little tunnel, which can be very entertaining to observe. At night they sometimes close the entrance of the burrow with a larger pebble as they reverse in. The aquarium must have a tight fitting cover, as these fish will jump, and lighting should always be turned on gradually so as not to startle your fish. Their constant excavation and digging means that powerful filtration and water movement is prerequisite. Blue Spotted Jawfish may be kept in small groups if you have a vast set-up; in fact they often do better this way, but do ensure that there is adequate space for them all to construct their homes (in the wild they may live as close as 90cm to one another). Ideally all will be introduced at the same time to eliminate any territorial issues. If the aquarium is on the smaller side, it really is better to keep a single specimen or a known mated pair (although bear in mind the tank must have floor space of at least 3ft x 2ft to keep just one of these fish comfortably, 5ft+ for more than one specimen). Tankmates, if desired, should be small and docile and enjoy the same coolwater conditions. This species may also be seen on sale as Rosenblatt's Jawfish. To sum up: the Blue Spotted Jawfish is a very interesting and attractive fish, and will do very well in the home aquarium if provided with the right environment; however, it cannot be emphasised enough that they are temperate and not tropical. Kept in warm water conditions long-term, they will not be able to live out a full, comfortable natural lifespan. A chiller will be indispensable in keeping the water at a sufficiently low temperature.",
        "feeding": "In the wild, this species feeds mainly on zooplankton. Offer a varied diet of small meaty frozen foods such as plankton, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, Mysis, and finely chopped krill/prawn/cockle/mussel. It may be helpful to feed the jawfish with a turkey baster, squirting some of the food above their burrows. An attached fishless refugium would also be very beneficial in providing an ongoing source of tiny natural foodstuffs.",
        "breeding": "Aquarium spawning reports are few and far between. During courtship, which, in the wild is reported to take place during the summer months, the male fish takes on a bright white colouration to the anterior half of the body, whilst he flits about a few feet above his burrow in the hopes of attracting a female. If successful, the female will join the male in his burrow and several hundred orange eggs will be deposited. These fish are paternal mouthbrooders, meaning that the male fish incubates the eggs."

Blue Star Damselfish are colourful, hardy, and well suited to the reef aquarium. However, this is a fairly aggressive species, and as these fish mature, their belligerence also often increases. It is therefore advisable to keep either a single specimen, a known male-female pair, or a large sized odd-numbered shoal (9+) introduced simultaneously as juveniles into a spacious tank with plenty of hiding places amongst the rockwork.

Juvenile fish are often associated with isolated patches of rubble where there are plenty of large shelters for them to hide within, whereas adults tend to form aggregations in open water in order to feed on zooplankton, sponges, and various crustaceans. These fish are best suited to a moderately boisterous fish-only set-up. It is not unusual for these fish to attain over 18\" in length including the long tail filaments, so the aquarium must be especially spacious (wide as well as long, to allow the fish a good turning circle). This will also enable you to aquascape the tank with a good quantity of live rock which will provide refuges for the triggerfish when resting or if startled, whilst still being able to maintain a decent amount of open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Ensure that all d\u00c3\u00a9cor is secure as these fish are more than capable of rearranging things to their liking. Also be aware that triggerfish are notorious for biting through tubing, and even heaters, so it is worth thinking very carefully about where you place your equipment. Powerful filtration and vigorous water movement are absolutely essential for the wellbeing of this energetic fish. Due to a highly territorial nature, keep only one specimen per tank, and not with any other Triggerfish species. Smaller fish are likely to end up on the menu, so only choose tankmates of similar size and disposition. As these fish mature, the teeth take on a distinctly red colour, hence one of its alternative common names: Redtooth Triggerfish. Although these curious, intelligent triggerfish often become \"hand tame\" and beg for food whilst making grunting noises, it is not advisable to feed directly from your hands as the fingers could easily be mistaken for a meaty snack. Always keep a close eye on where the fish is when carrying out any maintenance in the tank. As with many of the Balistid species, personalities of these fish can be quite varied.

Juveniles tend to settle in very shallow inshore crevices with abundant algae growth, whereas the adults swim further into the open waters above the reef, feeding on sponges, tunicates, and other encrusting organisms. This angelfish is a large-growing, active species and requires a voluminous aquarium. Due to its territorial nature, it will need to be provided with plenty of live rockwork that has a multitude of visual barriers and bolt holes, as well as a roomy swimming space along the front of the tank. Keep only one specimen per tank, and not with any other angelfish. Tankmates should be equally large and belligerent - this species should never be kept with invertebrates or small, passive fish. The aquarium should be well filtered, as these fish are voracious eaters, and do provide areas of brisk current with a good level of oxygenation. In the wild, Blueface Angelfish feed on many sessile invertebrates, including sponges, tunicates, stony corals, and soft corals, so unfortunately it is not suitable for reef aquaria. We recommend that the Blueface Angelfish is the last addition to an aquarium, as otherwise it can behave somewhat pugnaciously when introducing new tankmates into what it perceives as its established domain. It is best to choose a healthy individual that is under 20cm (8\"), as it will acclimatise to the aquarium much more easily; avoiding any specimens which seem disorientated or uninterested in food or their surroundings. Juvenile fish look very different to the adults: young fish display a pattern of mildly curved vertical stripes, alternating black, white, and blue. Once the fish reaches 12.5cm (5\") or so, the pattern will begin to change into the adult form of lemon yellow body colour with blue scales and bright yellow pectoral fins. The face becomes mottled with bright blue (hence the common name) with a striking yellow mask over the eyes. A distinct ocellus also forms at the posterior of the dorsal fin, just above the caudal peduncle.

When startled, the streamlined Blueheaded Tilefish plunge themselves into holes within the rockwork with incredible haste. This is an active, skittish species that requires specific conditions in the home aquarium if it is to thrive.

Powerful filtration, water movement, and oxygenation are a must. These fish can be kept in pairs or groups, if introduced simultaneously as juveniles; do not attempt to introduce another after time has elapsed though, as they will quarrel. Any tankmates should be of similar size and temperament, and shoals of peaceful dither fish already present will facilitate acclimatisation.

These beautiful, multicoloured fish are easy to keep, but a spacious aquarium is a necessity, as they are active, grow large, and are powerful swimmers. Ideally, there will also be plenty of rockwork and a sand substrate that is 3-4\" deep, to provide resting places for your wrasse. Provide clean, well-oxygenated water with areas of fast current. This is a fairly boisterous species that should only be kept alongside fish of similar size and temperament. Blueheaded Wrasses are protogynous sequential hermaphrodites and there are three primary phases, their colour and size depending on whether they are terminal phase (TP) males, initial phase (IP) males, or females. TP males are also known as \"supermales\" and have blue heads and green bodies. Three vertical stripes (black, white, black) divide the colours of the head and body, and these fish are generally of a large size. IP males and females are much smaller and have two colour forms. One type, known from reef areas, has a yellow upper half of the body with a slight greeny-black area and a white lower half; the other type, from inshore non-reef regions, is white both above and below the dark area. A dark spot is found on the anterior dorsal fin of both types of IP males and females. IP males and females have the ability to change into TP males and this switch includes a dramatic change of size and coloration. Once transformed from IP male or female to TP male, the change is permanent. It should be noted that in the aquarium, TP males are particularly territorial. Well-fed specimens should not harm corals, but they will prey on shrimps, snails, serpent stars, bristleworms, and small fish. It is best to make this species the last addition to the tank, so that it is less likely to harass any newcomers. Will jump from an open-topped aquarium.",

        "care": "The Bluelined Triggerfish is known from clear, shallow lagoons and the edges of seaward reefs, at depths between 30-50m (98-164ft). Juvenile fish tend to stay inshore close to small rubbly outcrops, whereas adults tend to frequent deeper reefs and shipwrecks, where they may be observed feeding on corals, crustaceans, dead fish, molluscs, sea urchins, and tunicates. These fish are best suited to a boisterous fish-only set-up. It is not unusual for these fish to attain over 18\", so the aquarium must be especially spacious (wide as well as long, to allow the fish a good turning circle). This will also enable you to aquascape the tank with a good quantity of live rock which will provide refuges for the triggerfish when resting or if startled, whilst still being able to maintain a decent amount of open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Ensure that all decor is secure as these fish are more than capable of rearranging things to their liking. Also be aware that triggerfish are notorious for biting through tubing, and even heaters, so it is worth thinking very carefully about where you place your equipment. Powerful filtration and vigorous water movement are absolutely essential for the wellbeing of this energetic fish. Due to a very belligerent and highly territorial nature, keep only one specimen per tank, and not with any other Triggerfish species. Smaller fish will end up on the menu, so only choose tankmates of similar size and disposition (i.e. large, boisterous fish that can hold their own). It has been reported that divers tend to stay respectfully clear of this species in the wild due to their fearless, aggressive nature. Juveniles that are under 5cm in length sport a yellowish colouration with dark saddles and numerous wavy lines on the body. As the fish mature, these dark saddles are lost, the flanks become yellow-brown, and the fish become covered in a network of brilliant blue lines which become increasingly interconnected with growth. Although these curious, intelligent triggerfish often become \"hand tame\" and beg for food whilst making grunting noises, it is not advisable to feed directly from your hands as the fingers could easily be mistaken for a meaty snack. Always keep a close eye on where the fish is when carrying out any maintenance in the tank. As with many of the Balistid species, personalities of these fish can be quite varied. A new added specimen may be a little shy at first, but it will soon gain confidence as it grows. May also be seen on sale as Blue Triggerfish, Blue & Gold Triggerfish, Brown Triggerfish, Rippled Triggerfish, or Yellowspotted Triggerfish.",

        "breeding": "Little is known about the spawning habits of the Bluelined Triggerfish, other than they form distinct pairs during courtship. They are unlikely to spawn in the home aquarium as even the largest of tanks may not provide enough territory for more than one specimen."

As with other members of the same genus, this goby forms a symbiotic partnership with an almost blind alpheid shrimp; together they share the safety of a burrow which the shrimp digs/maintains, and the goby keeps watch for predators. Whilst the shrimp is working, it maintains antennal contact with its goby partner posted at the entrance of the shared burrow. If the shrimp detects the quivering motion of the goby\"\u2122s caudal fin during an unusual situation, it reacts by immediately withdrawing into the depths of the burrow. The entrance to the shared burrow will be closed at night, and only one entrance is usually open at any one time. The shrimp will only emerge from the burrow whilst it can have tactile contact with the goby. Provided with a reasonable depth of coral sand and a good selection of loose coral rubble pieces that vary in size (not too big to be moved) these gobies can do very well in the home aquarium. The goby will survive without its shrimp partner, but if they can be acquired together, they will make such a fascinating display, captivating the observer for hours on end. Your dealer may be able to acquire the two together, it is certainly worth asking. The Bluespot Goby is a territorial species, and larger specimens will think nothing of attacking other gobies and even smaller, unrelated species such as wrasses and assessors. However, it is much less likely to be antagonistic if housed in spacious aquaria with plenty of visual barriers (although do remember to include large, open expanses of substrate), and where it is one of the last fishes added to the tank. Hostility normally initially takes the form of jaw gaping, fin flaring, and sideways shoving, but if it is allowed to escalate, real damage may ensue if the goby takes a bite at its adversary, so do observe very carefully. It is best to keep only one specimen per tank unless you can acquire a mated male-female pair, as conspecifics will fight. These gobies are considered reef safe as they will not harm sessile invertebrates, but be aware that they will predate on small, ornamental shrimps and small bristleworms. Ensure that the tank has tight fitting coverslides, as these gobies are accomplished jumpers. May also be seen on sale as Bluespotted Shrimp Goby.",

Here, these beautiful fish may be observed in small harems as they feed on zooplankton in the water column. Juvenile fish are orange, fading lighter ventrally, and there is a bright blue marking above each of the red eyes. As they mature, a series of broken light blue horizontal stripes start to appear across the flanks. Females remain fairly subdued in colour, with the dominant males much more colourful in comparison - the horizontal lines on the flanks becoming a bright blue, and the dorsal and anal fins much larger than those of the females. The dorsal fin of dominant males also develops a single long filament at the midway point, and the fin itself is orange in colour with bright blue, red (and sometimes black) highlights. The anal fin of the male is also adorned with a broad red band that is dotted with blue. During courtship rituals, the males can undergo spectacular colour changes within seconds as they dash in and out of the rockwork, displaying intense colours and flashing their elaborate fins to attract a female. This is an excellent species for the reef aquarium as it will not harm corals or pick on desirable invertebrates. The tank should be mature and as spacious as possible (this will enable you to keep multiple specimens), with a soft sand substrate. Peaceful by nature and easily bullied, Bluestripe Flasher Wrasse should only be kept alongside passive fish of similar size and peaceable temperament or they may feel too intimidated to venture out to feed. These wrasses are best maintained in small groups with several females to every male, but all individuals must be added simultaneously or else add all females before the male/s. Keeping these fish in small aggregations will encourage natural behaviour, with the males putting on some fantastic displays with fin-flaring, as they attempt to attract a mate. Such groups will only work in spacious quarters, so if the aquarium is smaller, it is best to house a single specimen or a mated pair. Close relatives such as Fairy Wrasses and other small planktivores such as Firefish (which occupy the same niche) are best avoided. At night, these fish rest inside a mucus cocoon created in gaps in the rockwork. Ensure the tank has tight fitting covers, as flasher wrasses will jump from an open topped aquarium.

        "care": "The Bluestriped Butterflyfish is endemic to Hawaiian waters, where it is most commonly observed at rocky and coral reefs to depths of 28m (92ft). Juvenile fish frequent protected, shallow reef flats during the summer months, with adults swimming in deeper areas, either as solitary fish or in small aggregations of 3-15 individuals. This is an omnivorous species, feeding mostly on benthic invertebrates, especially polychaete worms, plus stony coral polyps and various algae. This somewhat shy species is regarded as moderately hardy, but is best suited to experienced aquarists. A good-sized, mature system is requisite, along with ample live rock for the fish to browse upon/hide amongst and a large open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Medium sized specimens tend to acclimatise better to aquarium life, adapting much more quickly to various prepared foods, so try to choose a healthy, alert specimen around 7.5cm (3\") in length. Smaller sized fish may be very reluctant to feed, and larger specimens can sometimes be rather finicky, requiring faultless water conditions. An aquarium that has some areas of lush filamentous algae growth will also aid your new fish in settling into its new surroundings; however, as with other butterflyfish species, these fish demand excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of brisk current. Some aquarists have successfully kept the Bluestriped Butterflyfish alongside some of the more noxious soft corals, but this is something of a risk, and they should be observed carefully. Stony corals and many other sessile invertebrates will be constantly nipped at, so unfortunately must be avoided. Keep only one Bluestriped Butterflyfish per tank (unless a mated pair is acquired) and not with any other butterflyfish as they will squabble over territories. Whilst they can be rather shy when first introduced, providing them with ample retreats amongst the live rock should ensure they quickly gain confidence and venture out into the open. Tankmates should be of similar size and temperament; it is imperative that boisterous companions are avoided if this fish is to settle in and feed. The colouration and markings of the Bluestriped Butterflyfish are fairly distinctive, with well-settled individuals displaying a vibrant yellow background colour and thin blue stripes running diagonally over the body from the snout. Unusually, there is no 'mask' over the eye, a trait common in most (but not all) butterflyfish. There is a small black spot on the top of the head area, and a larger black blotch just in front of the caudal peduncle, the latter of which is thought to aid in confusing predators. May also be seen on sale as Bluelined Butterflyfish or Hawaiian Bluestriped Butterflyfish.",

        "care": "The Canary Blenny, also known as the Canary Fang Blenny, is known from lagoons and seaward reefs at depths of 3-15m (10-49ft). Whilst many of the Fang or Sabre-Toothed Blennies are known to parasitize other fish, those from the Meiacanthus genus (of which 28 species have been formerly described) feed only on zooplankton as they hover in the water column, and on tiny benthic invertebrates they find on the reef. Juvenile Canary Blennies tend to gather in small groups, whereas the adults are solitary or seen in pairs. Meiacanthus species tend to be quite inoffensive, but they do possess two venomous canine-like teeth in the lower jaw that can be employed should they be attacked. Most fish know to leave them alone, but if they are ingested, a quick, sharp bite on the inside of the predator\"\u2122s mouth from the blenny ensures that it is spat out again \"\u201c and it is usually none the worse for wear. These fish do not employ their weaponry in an active manner, instead they use it only as a last resort to defend themselves or their territory. Other fish such as the non-venomous Plagiotremus flavus and juveniles of the Fijian form of Scolopsis bilineatus have evolved to mimic this species in order to afford themselves protection from predators, even though they do not possess the same effective dentition deterrent as the Meiacanthus species. Whilst Canary Blennies can sometimes be a little secretive, they are generally far more self-assured than other blenniids (most likely due to the possession of such potent defensive apparatus) and will often be seen hovering about in the water column above the rockwork in an inquisitive manner. Provide the Canary Blenny with a mature tank that contains an abundance of live rock, so that it may continually graze upon it for small crustaceans; without such quantity of well-established rockwork, these fish will not fare very well. It is best to keep just one specimen per tank, unless you can acquire a known mated pair, as these fish can be a little territorial in the confines of the average aquarium. Will cohabit with most species, except for close relatives and much larger carnivorous fish. Ensure that the tank has tight fitting coverslides as these fish are expert jumpers. Please be aware that whilst the bites of Fang Blennies are not usually dangerous to most people, they can be very painful. Therefore some degree of caution is required when carrying out maintenance in the aquarium, taking particular care not to intrude too closely upon their territory. Never try to hand feed a Fang Blenny.",

        "care": "The flamboyantly-coloured Candy Basslet is known from the sheltered recesses of coral reefs, at depths between 15-70m (49-230ft). This fish belongs to the family Serranidae (the sea basses, groupers, and fairy basslets) and is one of around 30 species of reef basslets currently classified within the Liopropoma genus. Reef basslets are very popular in the hobby due to their relative hardiness, attractiveness, easy-to-feed nature, small adult size (most species), and the fact that they do not pick on sessile invertebrates. The Candy Basslet is highly prized by many aquarists, but despite the intense colouration, this is a retiring species that is often difficult to approach in the wild; therefore it does tend to command a hefty price tag when it is available. Although the Candy Basslet is fairly secretive, it makes a fascinating addition to reef aquaria where no small ornamental crustaceans are present, and often becomes bolder over time. The tank should be mature and furnished with a plethora of live rock to provide feeding opportunities and shady hiding places amongst crevices and caves. As a naturally solitary species, it is best to keep only one per tank, and not with any closely related fish, as despite its general shyness the Candy Basslet will behave aggressively towards them. The sexes cannot be told apart visually, but on occasion, mated pairs can be acquired. Tankmates to avoid include species such as dottybacks, grammas, firefish, and some of the wrasses, as many tend to occupy the same niches as the Candy Basslet and it will show much belligerence towards them. Do not house with large, aggressive species as these may intimidate the Candy Basslet, particularly at feeding time. Ideal companions could include Anthias spp., blennies, dwarf angelfish (but not all - research carefully), gobies, and smaller tangs. Powerful filtration and circulation with a high level of oxygenation are a must, as are tight fitting coverslides on account of the Candy Basslet's ability to jump.",

Juvenile fish are orange, fading lighter ventrally, and there is a bright blue marking above each of the red eyes. As they mature, a series of broken light blue horizontal stripes start to appear across the flanks. Females remain fairly subdued in colour, with the dominant males much more colourful in comparison - the horizontal lines on the flanks becoming a bright blue/purple, and the dorsal and anal fins much larger than those of the females. The dorsal fin of dominant males also develops 2-4 long filaments, and is red in colour with bright blue (and sometimes black) highlights. During courtship rituals, the males can undergo spectacular colour changes within seconds as they dash in and out of the rockwork, displaying intense colours and flashing their elaborate fins to attract a female. This is an excellent species for the reef aquarium as it will not harm corals or pick on desirable invertebrates. The tank should be mature and as spacious as possible (this will enable you to keep multiple specimens), with a soft sand substrate.

These wrasses are best maintained in small groups with several females to every male, but all individuals must be added simultaneously or else add all females before the male/s. Keeping these fish in small aggregations will encourage natural behaviour, with the males putting on some fantastic displays with fin-flaring, as they attempt to attract a mate. Such groups will only work in spacious quarters, so if the aquarium is smaller, it is best to house a single specimen or a mated pair. Close relatives such as Fairy Wrasses and other small planktivores such as Firefish (which occupy the same niche) are best avoided.

Here, they may be observed in small aggregations sifting the substrate for food items, later returning to their burrows that have been excavated underneath rocks. This behaviour continues in the home aquarium, with the gobies digging burrows underneath coral bases or rocks, so be sure that any structures are secure, and that there is a good depth of (live) sand in most parts of the aquarium. A large mature reef aquarium with a deep sand bed is a must for this species, which is recommended for advanced aquarists only. This will not only enable them to create a burrow, but is also a vital lifeline for them as they sift through this substrate in search for tiny invertebrate food items. The sand is taken in through the mouth, the food items swallowed, and the remaining sand expelled through the gills. These fish are not particular where they dump the sand they have sifted, and as it is usually expelled whilst the fish are in motion, it can end up dropping down onto and swamping prized corals. For this reason, they are not always a welcome addition to aquaria containing delicate coral life, and careful planning is needed. However, if their requirements can be met, it must be said that these fish do a remarkably good job of overturning the substrate and keeping it looking fresh. Wherever possible, this is a species that should be maintained in a compatible pair. Chalk Gobies should not be kept alongside other members of the Valenciennea genus as they will quarrel. Capable of jumping from open topped aquaria. May also be seen on sale as the Sixspot Goby or Sixspot Sleeper Goby.",
        "feeding": "This species gains the vast majority of its food through sifting the contents of large established sand beds for invertebrate life. Diet can be supplemented with small sized vitamin-enriched meaty frozen foods. They will starve to death in tanks without a mature sand bed.",
        "breeding": "This species has not been bred in the home aquarium. In the wild, the female will stay in the burrow with the eggs for several days until hatching, whilst the male patrols the entrance."

Typically they can be found at depths between 5 and 30 metres (16-98 feet). In the home aquarium, this diminutive angel can be surprisingly territorial, and so it is best kept in a large tank with plenty of live rockwork that has a multitude of visual barriers and bolt holes. Unfortunately this fish will nip at quite a range of invertebrate life, so it is not suitable for every set up. Keep only one specimen per tank, and not with any other angelfish from the Centropyge genus. We recommend that the Cherub Angelfish is the last addition to an aquarium, as otherwise it can be extremely territorial when introducing new tankmates into what it perceives as its established domain. Tankmates should not be too docile, being able to \"look after themselves\", but at the same time, not so large and predatory that they see the angelfish as prey. There are a couple of very similar looking species available in the trade, namely the Fireball Angelfish (Centropyge acanthops) which has an orange/yellow back as well as an orange/yellow head area, and the Flameback Angelfish (C. aurantonotus) which is very similar in appearance to C. acanthops but has a solid blue caudal fin rather than a transparent one. Another similar species, the Resplendent Angelfish (C. resplendens) endemic to the isolated Ascension Island, is rarely exported. To make things even more perplexing, some specimens of Cherub Angelfish have only tiny areas of orange/yellow, having predominantly deep blue-purple colouration covering almost the entire fish. The depth of colour on the areas of the fish that are orange/yellow tend to vary depending on collection location.",
        "feeding": "Should be offered a varied diet including Spirulina & marine algae as well as meaty fare such as vitamin/Spirulina-enriched brineshrimp, Mysis shrimp, special sponge-based Angelfish preparations, and finely chopped krill/squid/cockle/mussel. Feed small amounts 3 times per day.",
        "breeding": "This species has spawned in the home aquarium. As with other dwarf angels, Cherub Angelfish are protogynous hermaphrodites, a form of sequential hermaphroditism where an individual changes from female to male. In the wild, Cherub Angelfish are known to spawn at sunset, the male stimulating the female to release her eggs with biting motions along her abdomen. The fertilised eggs are abandoned in open water with no parental care taking place. Aquarium spawnings tend to occur soon after lights out. Once the floating eggs hatch, the larvae are extremely challenging to feed."

        "care": "Choat's Leopard Wrasse is one of 11 currently known species of Macropharyngodon, and although all are incredibly beautiful, this genera is considered very delicate and does have some specialist care requirements that must be fulfilled by the advanced aquarist if these fish are to acclimatise well to life in captivity. Choat's Leopard Wrasse is known from eastern Australia, Middleton and Elizabeth Reefs, and New Caledonia. Here it is found in channels and seaward reefs, over mixed sand, rubble, and coral areas, to depths of 30m (98ft). It may occur singly, in pairs, or in large aggregations of females, and is usually observed browsing for gastropods and foraminiferans amongst the substratum. This leopard wrasse requires a very mature, spacious aquarium with plenty of live rock and sand that supports its natural diet on an ongoing basis, if it is to thrive. If added to a newly set up tank, it will starve to death. There should be plenty of hiding places amongst the rockwork, with enough depth of substrate (7.5cm/3\"\u009d of fine sand) for the fish to bury if it feels threatened. Because of the difficulties in feeding this leopard wrasse, it should not be kept with fish that require a similar food source to survive, as otherwise one species may out-compete the other. There should be relatively calm areas in the tank that allow it to locate food successfully. Tankmates should be peaceful and of an easygoing nature so that your Choat's Leopard Wrasse does not feel harassed and subsequently stops venturing out to feed. Groups can sometimes be kept together successfully (added simultaneously) but larger numbers should only ever be considered for exceptionally large aquaria, as in the average sized aquarium, natural prey will deplete too quickly with that many fish requiring the same diet. Do not house with other Macropharyngodon species or pugnacious dottybacks and hawkfish, as they will fight for territory. When choosing your leopard wrasse, check that its body is not emaciated, and that it is actively searching for food. It is not uncommon for a newly added leopard wrasse to hide beneath the substrate whilst it adjusts to its new surroundings and altered circadian rhythm; in such cases it is best to leave them be, they will usually begin to explore within a couple of days. These fish require stable and optimal water conditions at all times, so a good filtration and maintenance regime is a must. Ensure that the aquarium has tight fitting coverslides with no small gaps in the hood, as these fish are expert jumpers. The colouration of juveniles and females are similar: a white body adorned with random vivid orange-red blotches (no two share the exact same pattern) and a black spot on the operculum. This black spot is edged with yellow above, and the black area can change intensity depending on the mood of the fish, sometimes changing to a greenish hue. Juvenile fish also display a small black spot on the first few dorsal fin rays. The fins of juveniles and females are almost transparent with random orange blotches on the anal fin. A terminal male, however, will display alternating horizontal stripes of white and orange along the anal fin. May also be seen on sale as Australian Leopard Wrasse or Red Leopard Wrasse. Not recommended for beginners.",
        "feeding": "Very challenging to feed. This species will spend many hours searching out micro-invertebrates living in amongst the live rock and substrate. It must be provided with natural prey. A constant supply of tiny live foods for this purpose can be cultured in a fishless refugium. Will often take vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, and sometimes Mysis, but this alone will not provide enough sustenance.",

        "care": "The exquisitely beautiful Halichoeres claudia is a member of the Christmas Wrasse complex; and whilst all members are of very similar appearance, the complex actually consists of 4 distinct species. This particular fish was formerly identified as H. ornatissimus, but is now considered a species in its own right. H. claudia is known from much of the Pacific and parts of the Indian Ocean, from French Polynesia to Australia (including the Cocos/Keeling Islands and Christmas Island) and on towards Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. H. ornatissimus is restricted to the waters around the Hawaiian Islands and Johnston Island. The two other members of this complex are H. cosmetus and H. orientalis; H. cosmetus may be found in the Western Indian Ocean and H. orientalis is a subtropical species known from the North-West Pacific. Various different meristic and morphometric measurements do aid somewhat in identification; and although H. ornatissimus shows no real differences from H. claudia in this respect, the former does attain a significantly larger size and is much more restricted in its distribution area. This article concerns H. claudia, perhaps the most colourful member of the complex. This eyecatching red and jade fish is known from outer barrier reef slopes, up to 35m (115ft) in depth, and is usually solitary. It feeds mainly on hard-shelled prey such as crustaceans, molluscs, and urchins, so it is a species that should be added to the reef tank with quite a bit of caution. Although it should not trouble corals, it will feed on a variety of invertebrates (see Reef Aquarium Compatibility section below). However, it can play a very useful role in helping to keep nuisance flatworms and pyramidellid snails (parasites of tridacnid clams) under control. The tank should be mature and furnished with plenty of living rock to provide feeding opportunities, shady hiding places and visual barriers. There should be a deep sand bed of around 3\" (7.5cm) or so, in order that the wrasse may bury itself at night or if startled. Keep either a single specimen, or, if the tank is large enough, a good sized group of 5 or 6 individuals (introduced simultaneously, when young and of the same size). Young Christmas Wrasses rarely cause problems in a community type set-up, but larger adults have been known to pick on small passive fish, such as flasher wrasses, fairy wrasses, and firefish, so these combinations are best avoided. Powerful filtration and circulation with a high level of oxygenation are a must, as are tight fitting coverslides; these fish are expert jumpers.",

        "care": "A long-standing favorite among many aquarists, Clark's Clownfish is one of the most sought-after and durable clownfish in the aquarium trade. These characterful fish are known from lagoons and outer reef slopes where they are afforded lifelong protection from predators and skin parasites by a host anemone. These fish are closely associated with a number of anemones, including Cryptodendrum adhaesivum, Entacmaeaquadricolor (Bubble), Heteractisaurora (Beaded), H. crispa (Sebae),H. magnifica (Ritteri), H. malu (Malu), Macrodactyla doreensis (Long Tentacle), Stichodactyla gigantea (Giant Carpet), S haddoni (Haddon's Carpet), and S. mertensii (Merten's Carpet). In the community reef aquarium, a host anemone - some of which can be a little tricky to maintain successfully incaptivity - is not necessary for your clownfish as most reef set ups contain plenty of hiding places, no large predatory fish, and sometimes cleaner shrimp/cleaner wrasse. In the absence of an anemone, some clownfish take up residence in what they see as a suitable coral substitute - which may cause them to retract in irritation as the clownfish wallow - but this isn't always the case. Many species of clownfish (including Clark's) are now captive-raised, so wherever possible the conscientious aquarist should aim to source these hardier specimens for the home aquarium, in turn helping to take pressure off the reefs. This is a colourful species, with vivid black, white and yellow stripes, though the exact pattern shows considerable geographical variation. As these fish can be somewhat territorial, keep only one pair per tank, providing them with ample space and plenty of visual barriers amongst thed\u00c3\u00a9cor. It is also best not to mix this species with other species of clownfish they will fight. With regards to sexing, all clownfish are born as males. A wild colony may consist of a breeding pair, which cohabits with a few-reproductive smaller male specimens. When the female dies, the dominant male will change sex and become the female. This is known as protandrous sequential hermaphroditism. In the case of two juvenile specimens in the home aquarium, the larger of the two will become the female. Please be aware that these fish are very sensitive to treatment with copper remedies.",
        "feeding": "Offer a varied diet including meaty items such as Mysis shrimp, chopped krill, vitamin-enriched brine shrimp etc, plus herbivore flakes and green foods. Feed small amounts 3 times per day.If living with a symbiotic anemone, many clownfish will share their food with them.",
        "breeding": "The clownfish will clean a smooth rocky surface (typically a flat wall inside a cave), where between 200 and 2500 elliptical amber-colored eggs will be deposited. These adhere to the substrate via fine threads at the ventral pole, and the male will aerate them by fanning them with his pectoral fins whilst guarding against predators. The eggs will hatch in darkness after 7-10 days, and the larvae typically settle after another 7 days or so. The tiny fry is left to fend for themselves and should be fed on suitably tiny foodstuffs such as live rotifers, moving on to baby brine shrimp after a few days. It is unlikely that fry will survive the attentions of the other fish in a community reef set-up."

This species makes a pretty and fascinating addition to reef aquaria where no ornamental shrimp, snails, or fanworms are present. The tank should be mature and furnished with plenty of living rock to provide feeding opportunities, shady hiding places and visual barriers. There should be a deep sand bed of around 3\"\u009d (7.5cm) or so, in order that the wrasse may bury itself at night or if startled. Keep either a single specimen, or, if the tank is large enough, a good sized group of 5 or 6 individuals (ideally introduced simultaneously). Clouded Wrasses are non-aggressive and may be kept alongside some of the more docile species such as firefish, flasher wrasses, and fairy wrasses. It is not uncommon for this species to clean other fishes in captivity and this behaviour should not be mistaken for aggression. Powerful filtration and circulation with a high level of oxygenation are a must, as are tight fitting coverslides; these fish are expert jumpers. Clouded Wrasse can often be observed searching for small live foods such as commensal flatworms, pyramidellid snails (clam parasites), urchins, tiny isopods, and small bristleworms.

Keep only one per tank, and not with any similar looking species or direct food competitors, as the Clown Tang is highly territorial. Generally speaking, this fish is safe in reef aquaria (provided that it is well fed), but do observe carefully as some specimens have been known to nip at LPS corals or take small crustaceans. It will actively browse on filamentous algae growing on the d\u00c3\u00a9cor, so a mature tank is essential. Due to its highly quarrelsome temperament, the Clown Tang should be the last addition to the aquarium; tankmates must be very carefully considered beforehand. Ensure that corals are well secure, as this tang is capable of knocking them over during sudden dashes around the aquarium. In the wild, Clown Tangs are found in the powerful surge zones of exposed seaward reefs, up to a depth of 15 metres. Within sizeable shoals of adult fish, a large male will control a well-defined feeding area and harems of females. Juveniles are more solitary and secretive, and are generally found amongst shallower rubble habitats. Vigorous filtration and circulation is a must for this energetic, voracious eater. Take care when handling, as the venomous caudal spines are particularly large and can inflict a painful wound. Specimens from the Philippines exhibit different colour patterns.",
        "feeding": "Feed a varied diet for omnivores, with a large vegetable component, in small amounts 3 times per day.

        "care": "The flamboyant ClownTriggerfish, with its outlandish body colours and patterns, is a solitary species known from clear seaward reefs, to a depth of 75m (246ft). The adult fish are often observed in open water, adjacent to steep drop-offs, whereas juveniles are much more secretive and spend most of their time in small,invertebrate-rich caves and crevices. The diet of adult fish largely consists of sea urchins, molluscs, tunicates, crabs, and other crustaceans. Despite many drawbacks (detailed below), this dramatic-looking fish is still hugely popular with aquarists. This is a species that grows quickly and requires an enormous aquarium due to its active nature and large adult size. There must also be plenty of suitable-sized shelters amongst the rockwork. The tank should be well filtered, as these fish are voracious eaters, and there should be decent current and good levels of oxygenation. Clown Triggerfish can be highly aggressive, so it is best to keep only one per tank, and not with any close relatives. Tankmates should be equally large and belligerent - this species should never be kept with invertebrates or small, passive fish. Although younger Clown Triggerfish have been known to be fairly amiable, they are notorious for being \"Jekyll and Hyde\" fish, abruptly turning nasty when least expected. They are quite capable of rearranging the decor, biting through pipework/heaters, and even attacking their owners, so much caution is required when arranging the decor/equipment and when carrying out maintenance on a tank containing a large ClownTriggerfish. Avoid purchasing the really tiny specimens that are sometimes seen in the trade, as these tend not to acclimatize so well to aquarium life. Instead, opt for a medium-sized specimen, and ensure it is the last addition to the tank - well-settled Clown Triggerfish do not take well to newcomers invading their territory. As the fish matures, it is likely to become quite tame with its owner and to a degree will interact through the glass. It is tempting to hand feed such a characterful pet fish, but this is not a good idea as it will be more than capable of taking a bite out of the fingers with its sharp teeth (which it uses to crush sea urchins, crabs, and other hard-shelled foods in the wild). Bear in mind that some specimens have been known to become so incredibly aggressive and territorial, that all tankmates have ended up having to be rehomed, culminating in the Clown Triggerfish being the sole resident of the tank. Nevertheless, kept alone in a spacious aquarium, the dog-like antics of the Clown Triggerfish cannot fail to please.",
        "feeding": "Offer a wide variety of meaty foods such as Mysis shrimp, krill, cockle, prawns, mussel, squid, silversides, crab, clam meat etc. Include hard-shelled foods to help keep the teeth worn down.

        "breeding": "Clown Triggerfish have beenbred in captivity for the ornamental fish trade, but few details are available.They are unlikely to breed in the home aquarium as even the largest of tanksmay not provide enough territory for more than one specimen. In the wild,spawning takes place over patches of mixed coral rubble/sand, and the lightgreen eggs (entangled in a circular mass, attached to the rubble) are guardedby one or both parents."

Unfortunately, this is a fish that may prove challenging to wean onto aquarium foods. Juvenile fish under 7.5cm (3\") in length are often much more reluctant to start feeding, hence the size recommendation. Collare Butterflyfish are best kept either singly or in large groups added simultaneously, to avoid aggression.

        "care": "The Common Clownfish is, quite understandably, an all-time favourite amongst many marine aquarists on account of its captivating personality and vibrant colouration. In the wild, clownfish are afforded lifelong protection from predators and skin parasites by a host anemone; Common Clownfish being most commonly associated with the Ritteri anemone (Heteractis magnifica), Stichodactyla gigantea, and S. mertensii. In the community reef aquarium, a host anemone - some of which can be a little tricky to maintain successfully in captivity - is not necessary for your clownfish as most reef set ups contain plenty of hiding places, no large predatory fish, and sometimes cleaner shrimp/cleaner wrasse. In the absence of an anemone, some clownfish take up residence in what they see as a suitable coral substitute - which may cause them to retract in irritation as the clownfish wallow - but this isn't always the case. Many species of clownfish (including the Common) are now captive-raised, so wherever possible the conscientious aquarist should aim to source these hardier specimens for the home aquarium, in turn helping to take pressure off the reefs. As these fish can be quite territorial, in the average sized aquarium you should aim to keep just one known pair. In XXL aquaria, more than one pair could be kept if they are all added at the same time as juvenile specimens and plenty of visual barriers are provided amongst the decor (or in the case of adding host anemones, enough anemones for all the fish, added at the same time as the clowns). If shelters are limited, the dominant clownfish will bully the others, picking them off one-by-one, so careful observation is necessary. Bear in mind that catching fish out of an established reef tank can be extremely difficult, so think carefully about adding more than one pair to your set up! It is also best not to mix this species with other species of clownfish as many will fight. With regards to sexing, all clownfish are born as males. A wild colony may consist of a breeding pair, which cohabit with a few non-reproductive smaller male specimens. When the female dies, the dominant male will change sex and become the female. This is known as protandrous sequential hermaphroditism. In the case of two juvenile specimens in the home aquarium, the larger of the two will become the female. Finally, do not attempt to house Common Clownfish with the Atlantic Carpet anemone (Condylactis sp.) as they may be consumed, and be aware that these fish are very sensitive to treatment with copper remedies. A tank-raised black and white colour variant of this species is often also available. May also be seen on sale as the False Percula Clownfish.",
        "feeding": "Offer a varied diet including meaty items such as Mysis shrimp, chopped krill, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp etc, plus herbivore flakes and greenfoods. Feed small amounts 3 times per day. If living with a symbiotic anemone, many clownfish will share their food with them.",
        "breeding": "The clownfish will clean a smooth rocky surface near to the base of their host anemone. Numerous eggs (numbering between several hundred to a few thousand) will be deposited and the male will aerate them by fanning them with his pectoral fins whilst the female guards them against predators. The eggs will hatch in darkness after 7-10 days, and once free-swimming, the planktonic fry are left to fend for themselves and should be fed on suitably tiny foodstuffs such as live rotifers, moving on to baby brineshrimp after a few days. It is unlikely that fry will survive the attentions of the other fish in a community reef set-up."

Juvenile markings closely mimic those of the venomous Striped Eel Catfish (Plotosus lineatus), whereas the cryptic adults are black with bold yellow stripes and blotches. The tank must be spacious to accommodate these large-growing fish. As they are superb diggers, do ensure that all rockwork is secure and cannot be undermined by their extensive tunnel digging; one way of doing this is to forward plan for these fish and place your rockwork before adding substrate to the tank. Peaceful in nature, Convict Blennies should get on with most other fish in the aquarium, provided that they are not small enough to be regarded as \"bite size\" and not overly aggressive. Concerning invertebrate compatibility, larger specimens will prey on ornamental shrimp, worms, and crustaceans, and it is wise to place corals off the bottom of the aquarium so that they do not become accidentally buried with sand during the Convict Blenny's digging activity. This burrowing behaviour is fascinating to observe and can be very beneficial in keeping the substrate turned over. Convict Blennies are \"scale-less\" and as such do not tolerate chemical treatments very well at all. It is best to keep on top of water quality to ensure that these aren't necessary. It is a shame that many dealers seem to retail Convict Blennies as single specimens; do try to secure yourself a good sized group and they will reward you with some very interesting natural behaviour.

However, its relatively placid nature means that it is easily bullied by other members of the Acanthurus genus and is therefore best kept in good-sized groups of its own kind, added simultaneously to spacious aquaria. If you wish to keep other tangs in the same tank, opt for Ctenochaetus, Naso, or Zebrasoma species rather than other Acanthurus species (again added simultaneously).

Known from many reefs across the Indo-Pacific region, the colours of individuals may vary considerably, some predominantly more purple or orange depending on their origin. The Coral Beauty requires plenty of live rockwork, on which it can graze, and in which it can hide. The larger the tank, the better, as the fish is less likely to continually pick at any particular sessile invertebrate and cause irreparable damage. Like most other members of the Centropyge genus, the Coral Beauty does not grow very large, but nevertheless, it is an active species which requires plenty of space. Unless the aquarium is of XL proportions, only one specimen should be housed per tank, and not with any other Centropyge species. If the aquarium is of appropriately large dimensions, it is recommended that multiple small sized specimens are added simultaneously (an odd number is best). This should only ever be attempted by advanced aquarists who have the means to separate the fish if a problem arises. Whilst not as aggressive as some members of the family, this is a fish that will become territorial if newcomers are added to the tank after it has become established (particularly small placid species) and so we advise that when planning on including a Coral Beauty in your stock list, it should be added to the aquarium last. When combined with pugnacious species, it will become very reclusive; conversely, you will see a great deal more of this striking fish when it is kept as part of a peaceful community.",

In the wild, adult fish form large aggregations amongst rocky coral reefs; the juveniles often commensal with large anemones, small coral heads, and sea urchins.\nCheap and extremely hardy, juvenile Dominoes are very attractive and reef-friendly, but grow into extremely aggressive fish that are likely to terrorise their tankmates. As with all damsels other than clownfish, dominant fish become male. Social groupings consist of a single territorial male, one or more females and unsexed juvenile fish. In the aquarium a stable group can be created, ideally by mixing individuals of different sizes that duplicate this natural order, or allowing sufficient space for weaker fish to escape serious harassment until a dominant individual develops. Any new humbugs added should be significantly smaller than established ones, duplicating the recruitment of juveniles from the plankton. Expect the male to defend a spawning site vigorously from all intruders apart from females ready to spawn.\n  Their aquarium should be spacious and include plenty of rockwork to break sightlines and create hiding spots; try to aquascape it in such a way as to create several visual barriers as this will help to minimise aggression levels. Although hardy, good filtration is a must and decent water movement will be appreciated. Peaceful tankmates are likely to be killed in all but the largest aquaria.\nDominoes are an active, interesting species to keep but do need to be kept in a stocking scheme that is well thought out beforehand. Removing them from a well-furnished tank will be extremely difficult at a later stage and adding any new fishes can be extremely challenging. It's true to say that many keepers regret adding these long-lived fish to their aquarium as their hobby develops and the frustrations of being unable to add new fish sink in. Sadly, as these fish mature, the colour and pattern becomes somewhat drab, with the white markings much less apparent (sometimes to a point where they can't even be seen) and the black body colour takes on much more of a steely grey appearance with dark scale margins. Mature adults are very deep bodied fish. There are many reports of these bold fish biting the hands of their owners as they carry out maintenance on their tanks.

Due to the aggressive nature of this fish and their limited value, few attempts have been made to rear Dascyllus damselfish in captivity as the resulting fish are not commercially viable."

        "care": "The Dot-Dash Blenny is known from shallow, clear coastal and outer reefs with rich coral growth, at depths between 1-15m (3.3-49ft). These fascinating, captivating bottom-dwellers require a mature aquarium with a sandy substrate and plenty of live rock to hide amongst and perch on. A spacious, well established tank will ensure an ongoing supply of natural microalgae for the Dot-Dash Blenny to graze upon. Some specimens may take a liking to certain coral species, so observe carefully. This is not so much of a problem if the fish is kept well fed and housed in larger quarters, where attention is spread amongst a large number of corals and so damage to any one piece would be minimal and recovery quick. The Dot-Dash Blenny is usually a fairly peaceful tank inhabitant, but can be very territorial to members of its own kind, closely related species, or small, placid bottom dwellers such as gobies and firefish. For this reason it is best to keep one specimen per tank, unless you can acquire a mated pair. The aquarium must have tight fitting coverslides as these fish are expert jumpers. May also be seen on sale as the Linear Blenny or Lined Combtooth Blenny.",

Juvenile fish tend to congregate in harbours and estuaries, whereas adults occur singly, in pairs, or small groups out on the reefs, where they feed on small invertebrates and plant material. Double Saddle Butterflyfish are relatively hardy aquarium fish, but they do require a mature system. Whilst they can be a little shy when first introduced, providing them with ample retreats amongst the live rock will ensure they quickly gain confidence and venture out into the open. Once settled, these peaceful fish actually become very assertive feeders and will compete with most other fish species. Smaller specimens do tend to acclimatise better to aquarium life, quickly adapting to various prepared foods. In larger quarters, multiple specimens may be kept together, providing all specimens are introduced simultaneously;  in such spacious aquaria, they will also usually tolerate the presence of other peaceful butterflyfish (again, introduce them simultaneously). As mentioned previously, the tank should contain an abundance of rockwork for the fish to hide amongst, with an open swimming area along the front of the aquarium. As with all butterflyfishes, this species demands excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of brisk current. The Double Saddle Butterflyfish may be mistaken for the similar-looking Falcula Butterflyfish (C. falcula) from the Indian Ocean, an altogether much more boisterous species.

Juveniles look much different to the adults, and are sometimes referred to as Reindeer Wrasse when in this colour/life phase, on account of the long \"antlers\" (elongation of the first rays of the dorsal fin). A sub-adult specimen is pictured above. The juvenile colouration is thought to act as a camouflage against predators, which, coupled with the specialised way in which they swim in the current, ensures they appear more like floating seaweed/vegetation than fish. The Dragon Wrasse is best kept as a single specimen in the confines of the aquarium. As this fish matures, its aggression level heightens and it should only be kept alongside fish of a similar size and temperament. The aquarium should have a deep sand bed between 5-10cm (2-4\") which will allow for your Dragon Wrasse to bury at night or if harassed or frightened. Powerful filtration and circulation with a high level of oxygenation are a must for this messy eater, as are tight fitting coverslides on account of its ability to jump. The other common name of \"Rockmover Wrasse\" has come about because of this species tendency to flip rocks, corals and large shells over in its constant search for food items. As such, do ensure your rockwork is as stable as possible, and observe regularly to make sure the structure has not been undermined.",

Perhaps the reason behind this may be itsrelatively drab colouration, as many aquarists opt for more vividly colouredspecies; nonetheless this fish has a subtle beauty with bright blue highlights andis a worthy addition to the home aquarium. Although it does not grow to a hugesize, this is an active fish that does require a good amount of space. Thelarger the tank, the better, as then the fish is much less likely tocontinually pick at any one particular sessile invertebrate and causeirreparable damage. Also, ensuring that the fish is well-fed means that itshould not pose any real threat to reef aquaria - although occasional specimensmay nip at some invertebrate life (see below) it should be noted that this onlyusually occurs if dietary requirements and feeding frequency are not being met.Careful observation is recommended. The Dusky Angelfish should be kept singlyand not with any other members of the Centropygegenus. Although this is a fish that can be quite shy when first introduced tothe aquarium, and may take a little time to settle, once it has becomeaccustomed to its surroundings, it can be rather territorial when new species(particularly docile/peaceful fish) are introduced to the tank afterwards.

This fish makes for a fascinating addition to mature reef aquaria, providing that one or two key requirements are met. These hard-working bottom dwellers need a mixed substrate that is at least 10cm (3.9\") deep. Ideally, this will be comprised of 75% coral sand, and 25% small pieces of reef rubble (varying from approx. 0.5cm to 1.5cm in diameter). This will allow to the fish to construct a burrow, in which it will spend much time resting just inside the entrance, seemingly watching the world go by and waiting for food morsels to drift past overhead. At other times it will be busy rearranging things in and around its little tunnel, which can be very entertaining to observe. At night they sometimes close the entrance of the burrow with a larger pebble as they reverse in. The aquarium must have a tight-fitting cover, as these fish will jump, and lighting should always be turned on gradually so as not to startle your fish. Their constant excavation and digging means that powerful filtration and water movement is prerequisites. Dusky Jawfish may be kept in small groups; in fact, they often do better this way but do ensure that there is adequate space for them all to construct their homes (in the wild they may live as close as 30cm to one another). Ideally, all will be introduced at the same time to eliminate any territorial issues. Tankmates should be small and docile. The coloration and mottled pattern of these fish is highly variable and they are capable of a degree of colour change to blend in with their surroundings.",

        "breeding": "Successful breeding reports are few and far between. Courting and spawning is said to occur at dusk or dawn. Dusky Jawfish are paternal mouthbrooders, meaning that the male fish incubates the eggs. These should hatch within 7-10 days. A ready supply of tiny planktonic foodstuffs will be required. Amazingly, young fish start digging their tiny burrows at just 3-4 weeks of age."

Juveniles, which are black with numerous longitudinal white streaks, are often encountered in outer reef flats. These fish feed mainly on small, hard-shelled prey including crustaceans and molluscs, so it is a species that should be added to the reef tank with some caution. Although it should not trouble corals, it will feed on a variety of invertebrates (see Reef Aquarium Compatibility section below). However, it can play a very useful role in helping to keep nuisance flatworms and pyramidellid snails (parasites of tridacnid clams) under control. The tank should be mature and furnished with plenty of living rock to provide feeding opportunities, shady hiding places and visual barriers. There should be a deep sand bed of around 3\" (7.5cm) or so, in order that the wrasse may bury itself at night or if startled. Keep either a single specimen, or, if the tank is large enough, a good sized group of 5 or 6 individuals (introduced simultaneously, when young and of the same size). Young Dusky Wrasses rarely cause problems in a community type set-up, but larger adults have been known to pick on small passive fish, such as flasher wrasses, fairy wrasses, and firefish, so these combinations are best avoided. Powerful filtration and circulation with a high level of oxygenation are a must, as are tight fitting coverslides; these fish are expert jumpers. The colour of the Dusky Wrasse varies greatly, depending on sex, age, and mood. Juveniles and females are much more muted, compared to that of a mature male in full breeding dress - showing an array of dazzling peacock-like dusky green and blue colours interspersed with bold red markings, and a bright green crescent on the caudal fin. Although this fish is currently considered a single species with a number of geographical colour variants, the taxonomic status is in some disarray with the possibility that it will be split into 2 or 3 separate species in the future; some experts stating that the name H. marginatus should be reserved for the Red Sea population only, with the Indian Ocean variants identified as H. lamarii (currently considered synonymous with H. marginatus), and further suggesting H. annularis for the Pacific Ocean fish.

The first generation of this hybrid fish - known simply as the Indigo Dottyback -  was rather more magenta and less stripy, but subsequent breedings have refined the characteristics to that of the Electric Indigo Dottyback that is pictured here, with more of a blue-turquoise hue and distinct horizontal stripes. This charming little fish is fairly peaceful as far as Dottybacks are concerned, and it makes a wonderful addition to reef aquaria where no small ornamental crustaceans are present. Be aware that adults will eat small shrimp, but they will also prey on many invertebrate pests; small fireworms are consumed with relish. The aquarium must be mature and should include ample rockwork, arranged so that there is an abundance of small caves, crevices, channels, and overhangs that provide safe, shady retreats for this fish. Electric Indigo Dottybacks generally mix well with other community type reef inhabitants, but occasional specimens can be a little territorial (although this is more likely to occur in smaller aquaria where space/hiding places are at a premium). Nevertheless, they should be one of the last fish introduced to the tank. Do not house with any large, aggressive species, as the dottyback will be very easily intimidated and may refuse to come out and feed, leading to starvation. If the aquarium is very spacious, and has plenty of visual barriers amongst the decor, more than one specimen may be kept together if of the same size and introduced simultaneously. However, if the system is on the smaller side, it really is best to keep just the one specimen and not with any easily bullied tankmates. It is essential that the tank has tight fitting coverslides, as Electric Indigo Dottybacks are expert jumpers. As with other dottybacks, these fish can readily change colour, depending on mood, time of day, or comfort level. Although hybrid fish are not to everyone's liking (there will always be pros and cons associated with this practice), once settled, these hardy and relatively peaceable dottybacks are really quite stunning.",

In thewild, juveniles have been observed in the semi-protected areas of outer reefflats, often hidden under ledges or in holes amongst the rockwork. Sub-adultsventure slightly further afield to surge channels, whereas larger, matureadults inhabit areas of rich coral growth in clear lagoons, channels, and seawardreefs. The maximum depth they have been observed at is 100m (328ft). The EmperorAngelfish is a large-growing, active species which requires a voluminousaquarium. This fish is territorial so provide plenty of live rockwork that hasa multitude of visual barriers and bolt holes, as well as a roomy swimmingspace along the front of the tank. Keep only one specimen per tank, and notwith any other angelfish. Tankmates should be equally large and belligerent -this species should never be kept with invertebrates or small, passive fish. Theaquarium should be well filtered, as these fish are voracious eaters, and thereshould be areas of decent current and good levels of oxygenation. EmperorAngelfish feed on many sessile invertebrates in the wild, including sponges,stony corals, and tunicates, so it is not a safe species for every set up;however, it can usually be kept successfully alongside some of the more noxioussoft corals. We recommend that the Emperor Angelfish is the last addition to anaquarium, as otherwise it can behave somewhat pugnaciously when introducing newtankmates into what it perceives as its established domain. Interestingly, inthe wild, both adults and juvenile Emperor Angelfish have been observedcleaning much larger species, such as the curious-looking Ocean Sunfish. Juvenilefish look very different to the adults: young fish are dark-blue/black with concentriccircular white and cyan stripes originating just in front of the caudalpeduncle. Adult fish have a yellow body with blue horizontal stripes and abright yellowy-orange caudal fin.

Although these pretty fish are considered much less aggressive than many of the damselfish species, their assertiveness often increases with age and maturity. It is therefore advisable to keep either a single specimen, a known male-female pair, or a large sized odd-numbered shoal (9+) introduced simultaneously as juveniles into a spacious tank with plenty of hiding places amongst the rockwork. Smaller groups are often known to suffer fatalities. Choose tankmates with care, avoiding any really docile species such as firefish and cardinalfish. This vibrant species was formally described in 2010, with the fish previously being known as Chrysiptera cf. parasema in reference to the close resemblance to the Yellow Tail Blue Damselfish (C. parasema). C. arnazae may be told apart from C. parasema as the former not only has yellow on the caudal fin and caudal peduncle, but it also displays yellow on the posterior margins of the anal, dorsal, and pelvic fins.",

They are usually found in moderately large mixed sex groups feeding on zooplankton, well above the substrate. In the home aquarium, it is essential to provide this species with consistently high water quality, decent current, and plenty of aeration. Provide an abundance of hiding places amongst live rock; Exquisite Fairy Wrasses may initially be quite shy, but should soon gain confidence. Keep only one male per tank and if planning on keeping a group (comprising one male and several females), be sure to add the entire group simultaneously, or else add all females before the male. Large males will behave aggressively towards other fairy wrasses and other small wrasse species introduced after them. Do not attempt to house with intimidating fish such as larger species of Angels and Tangs as their presence may make the Exquisite Fairy Wrasses feel threatened and then refuse to come out and feed. Having said that, these fairy wrasses can eventually become quite boisterous at feeding times, so ensure that any passive feeders do not miss out.

        "care": "The Eyespot Goby is known from lagoons and coastal bays where there is a silty substrate and plenty of cover amongst corals and reef rubble, to depths of 30m (98ft). These fish sometimes occur singly but adults are more commonly seen in pairs that share sandy burrows. These fascinating bottom dwellers are said to mimic crabs as they hop about with their two eyespot-clad dorsal fins held erect and the black pelvic and anal fins appearing like pincers underneath them. Another school of thought suggests that the lateral view of the fish mimics the face of a large, carnivorous fish, which would make much more sense as a defence mechanism. Either way, it only takes a split second for the large ocelli to confuse a predator. Eyespot Gobies are most often observed filter feeding from the fine substrate, sifting out tiny interstitial invertebrates from the sand. They should only ever be added to a well-established reef tank, where there will be plenty of live rock and live substrate that supports their natural diet. This species will spend many hours searching out the miniscule invertebrates living amongst the substrate. It absolutely must be provided with an ongoing source of natural prey and the best way to ensure a continuous supply of tiny live foods is by culturing them in an attached fishless refugium. If added to a newly set up tank, these fish will simply starve to death. There should be plenty of hiding places amongst the rockwork, with enough depth of fine substrate and small rubble pieces or shell fragments for the fish to construct a burrow. Because of the challenges in feeding Eyespot Gobies, they should not be kept with fish that require a similar food source to survive (e.g. Mandarins), as otherwise one species may out-compete the other. There should be relatively calm areas in the tank that allow the gobies to locate food successfully. Tankmates should be peaceful and of an easygoing nature so that the Eyespot Gobies do not feel harassed and subsequently stop venturing out to feed. Avoid housing with ornamental shrimp, as these are likely to become a snack. It is best to keep these fish as a known mated pair as single specimens are known to fare rather poorly in the aquarium. Two males placed together in close quarters will fight, so it is best to ensure that the fish you have are compatible (and not just two fish randomly paired up) and offer them enough space and visual barriers. A spacious tank not only provides them with enough territory, but also, very importantly, offers a much larger sandbed for feeding opportunities. This species may also be seen on sale as the Signal Goby, Twinspot Goby, Twospot Goby, or Crabeye Goby. Advanced aquarists only.",
        "feeding": "Challenging. This species does not typically take food from the water column but instead gains the vast majority of its food by sifting the contents of large established sand beds for invertebrate life. The diet can be supplemented with small sized meaty frozen foods such as finely chopped Mysis shrimp, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, baby brineshrimp etc plus copepods and amphipods. Ensure that food offered reaches the bottom of the tank, where the gobies will ingest it as they take in mouthfuls of substrate to sift. If food does not reach the bottom of the aquarium on a regular basis due to aggressive feeders in the same tank, the gobies are likely to become malnourished. Offer small amounts of food several times per day, target feeding if necessary. Before purchasing, please be aware that this species must be provided with natural prey (non-live foods rarely sustain them for any great length of time), and a constant supply of tiny foods for this purpose could be cultured in a fishless refugium. De-worming these fish in a quarantine tank, prior to adding to the main display would be very beneficial. They will starve to death in tanks without a mature sand bed.",

This nocturnal species may be observed singly or in groups, taking shelter in dark crevices, under ledges and branched corals, and amongst the spines of the long-spined sea urchin Diadema setosum. At night, these fish feed on crustaceans, gastropods, and small fishes. The aquarium should be aquascaped with plenty of live rock, creating lots of shady hidey holes and overhangs (do ensure these are secure). The more places of safety available to these fish, the more you will see them out in the open, as they will learn that they can quickly retreat if necessary. As this is a semi-aggressive cardinalfish, it is best to keep only a single specimen unless the aquarium is very spacious (over 6ft in length); in larger quarters, a group of 6 or more could be kept together if introduced simultaneously when juveniles. When keeping multiple specimens, good sized groups are a must, as when kept in small numbers, the smallest/weakest individual will be picked off until only one is left - maintained in larger numbers, any aggression is spread out through the group and no one fish should receive continual harassment. Tankmates should be of similar size, and the cardinalfish introduced last to give more docile species a chance to establish themselves first. Five-lined Cardinalfish are best kept in a reef situation, but not with any small ornamental shrimps, crabs, or snails. Avoid any small, bite-sized fish that the cardinalfish may prey on overnight and do not house with other cardinalfish species. As with many fish from the family Apogonidae, these large-eyed fish are active during the evening/night, and a period of blue moon lighting will enable you to observe their antics more closely after the main tank lights have been switched off. The bright yellow ocellus on the caudal peduncle is thought to confuse predators. May also be seen on sale as the Five-banded Cardinalfish or the Sharptooth Cardinalfish (alluding to the large canine-like teeth on both jaws).",
        "feeding": "Offer a variety of meaty items such as Mysis shrimp, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, finely chopped krill/cockle/clam meat etc. Feed small amounts 3 times per day, with at least one of the feeds after lights out.",
        "breeding": "Five-lined Cardinalfish form distinct pairs during courtship and spawning, which tends to take place at night. The male fish will mouthbrood the egg mass until hatching. The larvae are then released into the water column, where they develop for some weeks before settling out of the plankton. Once released, there is no further parental care."

        "care": "The Forktail Fang Blenny, also known as the Yellowtail Fang Blenny, is known from lagoons, seaward reef slopes,and drop-offs up to 30m (98ft) in depth. Whilst many of the Fang or Sabre-ToothedBlennies are known to parasitize other fish, those from the Meiacanthus genus (of which 28 species have been formerly described) feed only on zooplankton as they hover in the water column, and on tiny benthic invertebrates they find on the reef. JuvenileForktail Fang Blennies tend to gather in small groups, whereas the adults are solitary or seen in pairs. These pretty blue and yellow blennies are distinguished from others of the same genus by the blue-edged diagonal black line extending from the eye, yellow dorsal fin, and deeply forked caudal fin. Meiacanthus species tend to be quite inoffensive, but they do possess two venomous canine-like teeth in the lower jaw that can be employed should they be attacked. Most fish know to leave them alone, but if they are ingested, a quick, sharp bite on the inside of the predator's mouth from the blenny ensures that it is spat out again \" and it is usually none the worse for wear. These fish do not employ their weaponry in an active manner, instead, they use it only as a last resort to defend themselves or their territory. Other fish such as the Bicolour Blenny (Ecsenius bicolor)and the Bicolour Fang Blenny Mimic (Plagiotremuslaudanus) have evolved to mimic this species in order to afford themselves protection from predators, even though they do not possess the same effective dentition-deterrent as the Meiacanthus species. Whilst Forktail Fang Blennies can sometimes be a little secretive, they are generally far more self-assured than other blenniids (most likely due to the possession of such potent defensive apparatus) and will often be seen hovering about in the water column above the rockwork in an inquisitive manner. Provide the Forktail Fang Blenny with a mature tank that contains an abundance of liverock, so that it may continually graze upon it for small crustaceans; without such quantity of well-established rockwork, these fish will not fare very well. It is best to keep just one specimen per tank unless you can acquire a known mated pair, as these fish can be a little territorial in the confines of theaverage aquarium. Will cohabit with most species, except for close relatives and much larger carnivorous fish. Ensure that the tank has tight-fitting coverslides as these fish are expert jumpers. Interestingly, this species is replaced by the all-yellow M. oualanensis inFiji, and by M. tongaensis in Tonga. Please be aware that whilst the bites of Fang Blennies are not usually dangerous to most people, they can be very painful. Therefore some degree ofcaution is required when carrying out maintenance in the aquarium, taking particular care not to intrude too closely upon their territory. Never try to hand-feed a Fang Blenny.",

Mysis shrimp, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, zooplankton,and finely chopped finely shaved krill/prawns/mussel/cockle etc. should all betaken with much enthusiasm. Feed small amounts 2-3 times per day. Must beprovided with live rock where there will be an ongoing source of natural preysuch as tiny crustaceans and various algae.",
        "breeding": "This species has been bred incaptivity, and makes an excellent breeding project for the dedicated hobbyist. Dueto the difficulty in sexing these fish, some find that introducing a group of 6+juveniles to a specially set up (but established) breeding aquarium is the bestway forward, as it allows the fish to form a natural harem as they mature.Careful observation is in order and any subordinate males will require rehomingto another aquarium in order that the dominant male does not harass them todeath. It has been known for the dominant male to tend to many females, evenlooking after the eggs from several females that may have been deposited in asingle nest site, which may be in a rocky crevice or even a PVC pipe. Up to 300tiny, adhesive eggs (1mm diameter) will be deposited in any one nest and theseshould hatch within 7-8 days, depending on water temperature. During this time,the male fish guards and fans the eggs and does not let the female fish nearthe nest. The resulting larvae are very small at just 3.1mm in total length and0.63mm in body depth, and will require appropriately sized first foods such asrotifers. The larvae take around 35 days to reach settlement."

As with all damsels other than clownfish, dominant fish become male. Social groupings consist of a single territorial male, one or more females and unsexed juvenile fish. In the aquarium a stable group can be created, ideally by mixing individuals of different sizes that duplicate this natural order, or allowing sufficient space for weaker fish to escape serious harassment until a dominant individual develops. Any new humbugs added should be significantly smaller than established ones, duplicating the recruitment of juveniles from the plankton.

This somewhat shy species is regarded as moderately difficult to keep in the home aquarium, and is therefore recommended for advanced aquarists only. A good-sized, mature system is requisite, along with ample live rock for the fish to browse upon/hide amongst and a large open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Medium sized specimens tend to acclimatise better to aquarium life, adapting much more quickly to various prepared foods, so try to choose a healthy, alert specimen around 9cm (3.5\") in length. Smaller sized fish may be very reluctant to feed, and larger specimens can sometimes be rather finicky, requiring faultless water conditions. An aquarium that has some areas of lush filamentous algae growth will also aid your new fish in settling into its new surroundings; however, as with other butterflyfish species, these fish demand excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of brisk current. Some aquarists have successfully kept the Fourspot Butterflyfish alongside some of the more noxious soft corals, but this is something of a risk, and they should be observed carefully. Stony corals and many other sessile invertebrates will be constantly nipped at, so unfortunately must be avoided. Keep only one Fourspot Butterflyfish per tank (unless a mated pair is acquired) and not with any other butterflyfish as they will squabble over territories. Whilst they can be rather shy when first introduced, providing them with ample retreats amongst the live rock should ensure they eventually gain confidence and venture out into the open much more. Tankmates should be of similar size and temperament; it is imperative that boisterous companions are avoided if this fish is to settle in and feed.

Juvenile fish form large aggregations amongst Acropora corals, where they may be observed feeding on algae growing from the dead bases of the corals, whereas the adults are rather more territorial and tend to occur singly or in pairs. This somewhat shy species is a member of the venomous rabbitfish family, and is very similar in appearance to the One-Spot Fox Face (S. unimaculatus) but lacks the large dark spot on the posterior of each flank. You may often see juveniles kept together in large shoals without problems in your local aquatics store, but be aware that as the fish mature, they become intolerant of their own kind within the confines of the aquarium and should be kept singly, with the exception of a bonded male-female pair. Unrelated fish species will be ignored, most giving the Foxface a wide berth because of the venomous spines on their dorsal and anal fins. Needless to say, this is a fish that must be handled with much care when catching and acclimatising; ideally it should be gently herded into a submerged fish-bag or solid container, rather than risk using a net to lift it from the water. The fish is likely to erect its fins, entangling the sturdy spines in the netting, and at the same time there is the chance of the aquarist receiving a very painful sting. The tank itself should offer plenty of dark hiding places amongst rockwork, and employ decent filtration and circulation. If adding this species to a reef aquarium, be aware that occasional specimens do have a taste for coral polyps, particularly those that are hungry, so be sure to observe carefully and ensure the fish is receiving enough food. The Foxface has a small mouth that is specially adapted for browsing on algae (the main constituent of its diet). They must receive regular offerings of greenfoods in their diet, otherwise their colours will fade and their health may suffer. Meaty foods can be offered, and indeed will be accepted, but it is very important that rabbitfish receive a decent amount of algae-based foodstuffs as part of their daily nourishment. This species is capable of changing colour to a blotchy \"\u02dcfright pattern\"\u2122 at the blink of an eye. This can be due to a sudden shock (e.g. someone coming into the room where the aquarium is situated), an altercation with another fish, lights coming on too suddenly etc. Ideally the tank should be situated away from areas of high foot traffic. These fish also adopt the same blotchy pattern when resting at night. *If you are accidentally stung by your Foxface, it is best to seek medical advice immediately.*",
        "feeding": "Offer a varied diet that consists mainly of vegetable matter e.g. frozen foods containing Spirulina, plus marine algae, Nori (dried seaweed) and green marine flake food. Will accept small meaty foods such as Mysis shrimp, vitamin/Spirulina enriched brineshrimp, finely chopped krill etc, but this should be as a supplement to the predominantly herbivorous diet. A mature tank with a healthy growth of algae on the rockwork is immensely helpful in providing the Foxface with natural grazing opportunities.",

This fish makes for an impressive addition to XXL aquaria; however, as it is seldomly exported, it does tend to command quite a high price tag. Freckle Faced Tangs grow large and they require adequate swimming space due to a very active nature. Keep only one per tank, and not with any similar looking species or direct food competitors. Generally, the Freckle Faced Tang is safe in reef aquaria (provided that it is well fed), but do observe carefully as some larger specimens have been known to nip at LPS corals. It will actively browse on filamentous algae growing on the decor, so a mature tank is vital. Due to its boisterous temperament, the Freckle Faced Tang should be the last addition to the aquarium. Ensure that corals are well secure, as a large specimen is capable of knocking them over during sudden dashes around the aquarium. Powerful filtration, circulation, and a high level of oxygenation are essential for this energetic, voracious eater. Take care when handling, as the caudal spines are particularly large and can inflict a painful wound. Freckle Faced Tangs are capable of fast and dramatic colour change, dependent upon mood. The photograph above shows the fish in dark dress, with prominent yellow freckles; in an instant, the body colour can turn light grey and the freckles become light blue. As the fish matures, the head shape grows more convex, and the caudal fin filaments can become very long.",
        "feeding": "Feed a varied diet for omnivores, with a large vegetable component, in small amounts 3 times per day. Although this species will browse on algae within the aquarium, its diet must be supplemented with frozen herbivore rations, green marine flake, Spirulina (blue-green algae), Spirulina-enriched brineshrimp, cucumber, lettuce, broccoli, Nori (dried seaweed) etc. It will also take meaty frozen foods, but be sure that it is receiving enough green food to help prevent HLLE.

These majestic fish are often seen in pairs as they cruise about the reef, feeding on algae, bryozoans, gorgonians, sponges, tunicates, and zoantharians. Juvenile fish, which look rather different to the adults, tend cleaning stations where they service a broad range of clients, including grunts, jacks, morays, snappers, tangs, and wrasses. This angelfish is a large-growing, active species and requires a voluminous aquarium. Due to its territorial nature, it will need to be provided with plenty of live rockwork that has a multitude of visual barriers and bolt holes, as well as a roomy swimming space along the front of the tank. Keep only one specimen per tank, and not with any other angelfish. Tankmates should be equally large and belligerent - this species should never be kept with invertebrates or small, passive fish. The aquarium should be well filtered, as these fish are voracious eaters, and do provide areas of brisk current with a good level of oxygenation. As mentioned above, in the wild, French Angelfish feed on many sessile invertebrates, including stony corals and soft corals, so unfortunately it is not suitable for reef aquaria. We recommend that the French Angelfish is the last addition to an aquarium, as otherwise it can behave somewhat pugnaciously when introducing new tankmates into what it perceives as its established domain. It is best to source a medium sized specimen (i.e. over 5\" in length) as they are more likely to acclimatise well to life in captivity. Tiny or extra large specimens may have a difficult time settling in, so aim for a healthy-looking fish that is neither too small nor excessively large. Juvenile fish look rather different to the adults: young fish display a pattern of six vertical yellow stripes (including two on the tail), some mildly curved. Once the fish reaches 12.5cm (5\") or so, the pattern will begin to change into the adult form with the stripes disappearing completely and the fish displaying yellow flecks across the dark grey flanks. The pictured fish is a young adult which is still displaying the stripes, and the yellow flecking has started to appear on the flanks. Confusingly, juvenile French Angelfish look almost identical to juvenile Grey/Gray Angelfish (P. arcuatus); however, the caudal fin of P. arcuatus is more squared off and has a transparent margin in comparison to that of P. paru.",
        "feeding": "Should be offered a varied diet including ample Spirulina & marine algae as well as meaty fare. Mysis shrimp, vitamin/Spirulina-enriched brineshrimp, special sponge-based Angelfish preparations, and finely chopped krill/squid/cockle/mussel, should all be taken eagerly. Feed small amounts 3 times per day.",
        "breeding": "This species has not been bred in the home aquarium, but has been captive bred in the trade. In the wild, these fish form monogamous pairs. At sunset when a pair is ready to spawn, they ascend the water column in a slow, side-by-side fashion, angling their bodies so that their vents are touching as gametes are released, and they then separate on the descent."

        "care": "The Gold Neon Goby is a charming little fish that makes a wonderful addition to the reef aquarium. In the wild, this hardy species is found amongst coral heads at depths up to 50m (164 ft). Brightly coloured and peaceful, Gold Neon Gobies also readily reproduce in captivity, which makes for a very interesting breeding project. Gold Neon Gobies are regularly observed servicing fish that have ectoparasites, helping to control diseases such as Lymphocystis and marine whitespot. An advantage over most other cleaner fishes is that the Gold Neon Goby is not an \"\u02dcobligate cleaner\"\u2122 (i.e. it does not rely on cleaning/eating parasites for optimal health). As such, it will do just as well in a healthy aquarium where it is offered quality commercially prepared foodstuffs. This diminutive goby rarely shows aggression towards other species, although it will fight with members of its own kind, especially in smaller aquaria where space and territories are more limited. Large groups (7+) can be kept if the system is spacious; however in smaller aquaria it is advisable to keep either a single specimen or a known mated pair. Although these gobies cannot be sexed externally, it is often fairly easy to pick out a compatible pair at your local aquarium store as they may have paired off and be resting very close to one another. With regards to compatibility, Gold Neon Gobies are ideal for community reef aquaria; they are also often purported to coexist with a number of unlikely large predators, which usually tend to leave the gobies alone on account of their known cleaning services. However, much caution is necessary as all fish vary in personality and temperament and there can be no guarantees when it comes to their safety with such tankmates present. Observe carefully and if in any doubt, do not add them to your aquarium. It is not advisable to add Gold Neon Gobies to an aquarium containing predatory crabs. These fish are often available as captive-bred specimens, which assists with the sustainability of wild populations. May also be seen on sale as the Sharknose Goby.",
        "feeding": "Will consume a wide range of meaty fare including Mysis shrimp, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, finely shaved krill/prawns etc. Feed small amounts 3 times per day.",
        "breeding": "Gold Neon Gobies have been bred successfully both on a commercial basis and in the home aquarium. These fish always form distinct pairs when spawning. Demersal eggs will be laid on a variety of substrates/d\u00c3\u00a9cor and cared for by the parents. If you wish to raise a larger number of fry, offer the pair a spawning medium such as a short section of small diameter pvc pipe, and once the eggs have been laid/fertilised, the pipe and eggs can be carefully moved to a separate aquarium (with identical water conditions) where they will be safe from predation. You will need to ensure that the eggs are very gently aerated in the absence of the parent fish. The time it takes for the eggs to hatch will vary depending on water temperature and other factors, but on average this is usually around 8 days. The larvae can be fed on zooplankton and small rotifers, moving on to larger foodstuffs (such as baby brineshrimp) as they grow and metamorphose into small versions of the adults."

For this reason, keep only one specimen per tank, and not with any other tangs. The aquarium should be spacious, mature, and aquascaped with plenty of live rock. High water quality and areas of powerful flow are essential. A healthy growth of microalgae will be extremely beneficial as this lively herbivore spends a large part of the day grazing with its flexible comb-like teeth. It is important that this fish receives a generous amount of vegetable matter in its diet in order to help prevent head and lateral line erosion. This is the only Ctenochaetus species with both angular dorsal and anal fins. Also, juvenile fish have a forked caudal fin, which transforms to a lunate shape in adults.

It is quite variable in colour, from grey to a coppery brown-orange and with a grey-bluehead. The iris is yellow and a blue-black and bright yellow-orange double line runs from below the eye across the gill cover. There are several very similar-looking species in this genus, and this one is best distinguished by the prominent black spot on the caudal peduncle, hence the alternative common name of Tail Spot Blenny. This is one of the smaller blenny species which, with its large eyes, small mouth, and cirri protruding between the eyes, appears quite comical as it hops about and perches around the aquarium. In the wild, the Gold Streak Blenny is typically found among corals and rocky crevices and therefore requires an abundance of liverock in the home aquarium for grazing on and hiding/resting between. A mature reef aquarium will suit this fish, but be aware that if underfed, occasional specimens may nip at SPS corals, some LPS corals, and clam mantles. An established set-up should also ensure there is sufficient algae for the fish to browse upon, which should divert its attention away from sessile invertebrates. It is best to keep only one specimen per tank unless you can acquire a male-female pair, as these fish can be surprisingly territorial over the bottom area of the tank. Do not keep with closely related fish or smaller, more docile bottom dwellers such as firefishes. Apart from this, other fish do not usually bother the Gold Streak Blenny; however do avoid any large, aggressive species which may easily intimidate these fish and stop them from feeding. Ensure that the tank has tight-fitting coverslides as these fish are expert jumpers. All in all, a very characterful fish, which, once settled, will enjoy sitting on a favourite perch and watching all the goings on in and around the aquarium.",
        "feeding": "This species does best if a moderate growth of filamentous algae is already present in the aquarium for the fish to browse at its leisure. Also offers plenty of vegetable matter, including frozen foods that contain marine algae and Spirulina. Nori (dried seaweed), algae flake and algae wafers formulated for marine fish are usually met with much enthusiasm. If you have space in a well-lit sump, filamentous algae can be cultured on pieces of rock and occasionally rotated with some of the pieces in the main display aquarium. Feed small amounts 2 or 3 times per day. Will also take vitamin-enriched brine shrimp and Mysis shrimp as an occasional treat.",
        "breeding": "There are a few reports of this species having spawned in the home aquarium. The male will select a small one and entice the female towards it. The demersal eggs are adhesive and are deposited all over the cave walls/ceiling. The male waits outside the cave and every so often he will make short repeated dashes inside to fertilise the eggs. The female may deposit several batches of eggs into the nest over the course of 4 or 5 days. When she exits the cave, the male takes her place. Once the eggs hatch (24-72 hours, temperature dependent), raising the tiny larvae is extremely challenging. You may need to move the cave/eggs to a rearing tank with matching WaterParameters and have a ready and continual supply of tiny foodstuffs on hand, such as rotifers, to feed the larvae once the yolk sacs have been absorbed."

Here, this beautiful fish may be found amongst rubbly and coral-rich areas, staying close to caves and crevices that are characterised by abundant encrusting sponges. This shy species is seldom encountered by divers, and so tends to command a high price tag when it is available. It is essential that this retiring, delicate fish is placed into a spacious mature system with plenty of live rock and no aggressive tankmates if it is to do well. It should be the only angelfish present in the tank, unless a mated pair can be acquired. Ideally, the tank will be both long and wide to allow for plenty of aquascaping with living rock (ensure there is an abundance of caves, overhangs and archways) and to accommodate the growth of stony coral cover. A larger tank should also ensure that the fish is more unlikely to continually pick at any one particular sessile invertebrate and cause irreparable damage. Powerful filtration is a must, as is decent water movement /high level of oxygenation. As stated before, tankmates should be of a placid nature so as not to intimidate or outcompete the angelfish at feeding time. As the Golden Angel typically frequents dark, shady areas in deeper waters, it should be acclimatised to bright aquarium lighting very gradually. The lighting should be kept off during the acclimatisation process, with the illumination slowly and progressively increased over a period of several days to allow the fish time to adjust. This could present a problem for many species of photosynthetic coral, so you may choose to add the angelfish before too many prized corals are installed. However, it absolutely must only ever be added to a biologically established set-up, so careful planning is required. Golden Angelfish are recommended for experienced aquarists only.",

As their planktonic prey is swept to them in these areas of brisk water movement, they can be relaxed about resources and enjoy protection from predators amongst the branching coral thickets. This makes them amongst the most peaceful of the notorious damselfish family.\n  Being a relatively peaceful social species, Chromis should be kept in groups of 6 or more. These active fish spend a lot of time out in the water column, in turn acting as \"dither fish\", encouraging more reclusive species out into the open and encouraging other plankton feeders to try a range of prepared diets that more finicky fishes may not recognise as food. Single specimens may pine away in the corners of the tank or become harassed by other tankmates; indeed, keeping this sociable species in this way could be considered cruel. As with any damselfish, groups are most stable when a single larger dominant fish is added alongside smaller specimens - this larger fish will rapidly become a territorial dominant male, even if this means a change of current gender. This mimics the situation seen in nature and stops individuals fighting over the top spot. Multiple males can coexist in large set ups if numbers are high and each has access to a spawning territory.\n  Green Chromis are generally peaceful, relatively hardy, and are considered a good beginner's fish. Tankmates should be of a peaceful nature, although larger territorial species such as tangs and angelfish seldom see them as a threat.\n  A similar species, the Black-axil chromis (C. atripectoralis) can be easily mistaken for the Green chromis and differs in having a dark spot at the base of the pectoral fin.",

Here this coral-commensal goby is found singly or in pairs, amongst branches of Acropora. These fish are characterised by a green body colour with red to violet stripes, broken lines, or rows of spots on the flanks, 4-5 reddish bars on head, and an absence of scales. The modified ventral fins have fused to form a kind of suction cup that helps them to maintain position on coral branches in swift currents. Green Coral Gobies are generally of a peaceful nature and make a wonderful addition to mature reef aquaria containing established colonies of broad-branching SPS corals, which they very much enjoy hiding amongst. Although often recommended for nano aquaria because of its diminutive size, caution should be exercised for two reasons. Firstly, smaller tanks will limit the number of individuals you can keep together; only one specimen is recommended in small nano type tanks, otherwise there will be constant arguments over territory which could result in the untimely demise of the weaker individual. Secondly, the more space available in a reef setting, the chances are that there will be much larger, stable colonies of suitable SPS corals available, and so it is less likely that these fish will damage any one individual beyond repair as they go about their daily routines (hiding/resting amongst the branches, and feeding on the occasional mucous polyp). If these types of corals are not being cultivated in your aquarium, invest in several coral skeletons so that these fish have something natural to interact with and give them a sense of security. Green Coral Gobies may be kept in groups (but only in larger quarters where there is an abundance of hiding places/territories), and oftentimes these fish will pair up and spawn. With regards to tankmates, these should all be small, non-aggressive feeders. These gobies actually produce a thick toxic body slime that deters many species from trying to consume them. Having said that, obviously do not house these fish with large carnivores. In the wild, these gobies are most commonly associated with Acropora nasuta, but they are also known to inhabit the branches of A. millepora and A. valida, and sometimes A. tenuis.

These fish are bi-directional protogynous hermaphrodites (which is sometimes referred to as a bi-directional sex change), which is an uncommon trait among gobies, meaning that any two fish placed together are guaranteed to form a male-female pair. These fish tend to strip a small area of coral polyps in order to create a place to deposit their eggs, although other sites are not unheard of. The male fish will dance/quiver in front of the female and when she is ready to spawn, she will deposit her eggs on the coral branch, and these are immediately fertilised and subsequently guarded by the male. The eggs are very small (less than 1mm in diameter) and can number several hundred. The presence of the eggs on the coral may cause a small amount of tissue recession in that area, but this should recover quickly once the eggs have hatched (4-5 days, dependent on water temperature). The larvae are miniscule and require appropriately sized foodstuffs such as cultured rotifers and copepods."

A mated pair will occupy the same burrow, but if a large shoal is startled or when danger approaches, many individuals will hastily retreat or 'dart' into the same refuge together. The aquarium should be mature and offer plenty of swimming space. There should be ample nooks and crannies amongst the rockwork for the fish to hide in, as well as a fine sand substrate into which they can bury at night or when startled.

        "breeding": "This species has spawned in the home aquarium, but to date, no-one has successfully reared the young. Keeping a large sized group of adults will greaten the chances of  having both sexes, and a compatible pair may naturally form. When ready to breed, the male will display his fins and 'mouth' at the female, before swimming parallel with her in a courtship dance. A mass of yellow eggs are deposited in a crevice, with the adults guarding them until they hatch. The resultant fry are minuscule and very sensitive to environmental fluctuations."

Specimens from Australia's Great Barrier Reef have not only proven more colourful, but are also generally much hardier. The aquarium should be aquascaped with plenty of live rock to form numerous hiding places, with an open swimming space left along the front of the tank. Juvenile Harlequin Tuskfish are usually quite shy and will spend a fair bit of time hiding until they gain size and confidence. Unusually for wrasse, these fish do not bury themselves in the substrate, although they tend to rest near the tank bottom at night. Larger specimens, despite the somewhat ferocious appearance (those big blue teeth!), are gentle giants and are actually easily bullied, so choose tankmates with care. Anything bite-sized should also be avoided, as should crustaceans, molluscs, and shrimp (even cleaners). In the wild, adults are solitary and maintain a large territory amongst seaward reefs; for this reason, keep only one per tank as otherwise major territorial issues will arise. Other large wrasse species are also best avoided. Be sure to keep on top of water quality; powerful filtration/circulation and a high level of oxygenation are essential for this voracious eater of high protein foods. There are several species in the genus Choerodon (formerly Lienardella) but it is really only the Harlequin Tuskfish that has the eye-catching colouration, great personality, and acceptable adult size that makes it so popular in the trade.",

These fish have a high metabolism - feed small amounts 3 or 4 times per day.",

The aquarium should be aquascaped with plenty of live rock, creating lots of shady hidey holes and overhangs (do ensure these are secure). The more places of safety available to these fish, the more you will see them out in the open, as they will learn that they can quickly retreat if necessary. Harrow Cardinalfish are a shoaling species and really should be maintained in small groups of at least 5-7 specimens, introduced simultaneously. Keeping these fish in decent numbers will not only make the fish less nervous, but will also result in a more effective, natural-looking display. It is important that tankmates are of a peaceful nature; they should not include large, carnivorous, or intimidating species (the latter which may prevent the cardinals from feeding). Harrow Cardinalfish are best kept in a reef situation, but not with any small ornamental shrimps; however, unlike many of their relatives, this species is less of a threat towards other small fishes and crustaceans. As with many cardinals, these large-eyed fish are active during the evening/night, and a period of blue moon lighting will enable you to observe their antics more closely after the main tank lights have been switched off. The oxina part of the scientific name means harrow or rake and is in reference to the to the vertical bars on the side reaching the stripe, forming a rake-like pattern.",

These fish tend to live in pairs and they are often seen hovering together in the water column feeding on zooplankton; however they tend not to stray far from cover.\nThis species is an ideal candidate for the mature reef aquarium; it is colourful, relatively peaceful, and readily acclimatises to aquarium life. The tank should be aquascaped with plenty of live rock so that there are numerous nooks and crannies for your firefish to dart into if startled; they especially favour piles of loose rubble. There should be areas of brisk water movement and a high level of oxygenation, these fish can often be seen hovering in the water column, facing the strong current whilst waiting for microscopic food morsels to drift past. Helfrich\"s Firefish will rarely become aggressive towards other fish species (except close relatives), but it can be very territorial with its own kind, and they will fight fiercely unless they are a mated pair. For this reason it is best to either keep a single specimen (particularly in smaller, \"\u02dcnano\" aquaria) or acquire a known mated pair. These fish cannot be easily sexed externally and simply putting two specimens together and hoping for the best is unlikely to work, although adding a group to a large aquarium will usually result in harmonious pairing, with 'spare' fish being removed if they become victims of aggression. Tankmates should be of a peaceful nature in order that the firefish do not feel intimidated at feeding times. Observe very carefully, as firefish are easily bullied. Do ensure that the tank has tightly fitting coverslides and absolutely no escape holes, as these fish are expert jumpers. Take care when acclimatising too, as they will jump from the shipping bag if it is not covered. There are two colour forms of N. helfrichi, with individuals from French Polynesia exhibiting a slightly different colour pattern than those from Micronesia and Japan.\n\n* It seems that the fish we've been familiar with as N. helfrichi is an imposter! The yellow-faced fish that we see regularly turns out to be the Lavender-blushed dartfish newly described as Nemateleotris lavandula.",

This variant was once thought to be a different species and was erroneously referred to as \"Centropyge whiteheadi\" but is now known to be a geographical colour variant of C. heraldi. Another variant has a black blotch on the posterior of the dorsal and also a black anal fin. Interestingly, these black patches are said to sometimes disappear in the aquarium, rendering the fish a solid golden yellow, akin to the standard form. Dusky coloured variants are also known from Cebu and Vanuatu, and these may have a dusting of black all over, or just confined to one area, such as the head.

These fish are usually observed in pairs, hovering just a few centimetres above the sandy/rubbly substrate at the entrance to their burrow, which they share with an alpheid (pistol) shrimp. Hi-fin Banded Gobies are very passive and make a great addition to peaceful reef aquaria. They are best kept in a compatible male-female pair (your supplier may be able to source you a mated pair) but be sure not to simply place two individuals together from different sources, as if it turns out that they are both males, they will fight - especially in smaller aquaria. The tank should be furnished with plenty of live rock and a reasonable depth of sandy substrate (~10cm/4\"), with a good selection of small rubble pieces that vary in size (not too big to be moved), from which a burrow can be created. Tankmates should be small and peaceful, as pugnacious species will intimidate these diminutive bottom dwellers and prevent them from feeding. As with other members of the same genus, this goby forms a symbiotic partnership with an almost blind alpheid shrimp; together they share the safety of a burrow which the shrimp digs/maintains, and the goby keeps watch for predators. Whilst the shrimp is working, it maintains antennal contact with its goby partner posted at the entrance of the shared burrow. If the shrimp detects the quivering motion of the goby\"\u2122s caudal fin during an unusual situation, it reacts by immediately withdrawing into the depths of the burrow, hastily followed by the goby. The entrance to the shared burrow will be closed at night, and only one entrance is usually open at any one time. The shrimp will only emerge from the burrow whilst it can have tactile contact with the goby. A shrimp partner is not strictly necessary, but if they can be acquired together, they will make such a fascinating display, captivating the observer for hours on end. The usual shrimp that partners the Hi-fin Banded Goby is the Red and White Barred Shrimp Alpheus randalli. Your dealer may be able to acquire the two together, it is certainly worth asking.

Just prior to spawning, the belly of the female fish will become noticeably swollen when full of eggs. Spawning occurs inside the cave or under a rock, where an egg mass will be deposited/fertilised. The eggs should hatch within 5-6 days (temperature dependent) and it is believed that the larvae take around a month to undergo metamorphosis."

This fish belongs to the family Serranidae (the sea basses, groupers, and fairy basslets) and is one of around 50 species of reef perchlets currently classified within the Plectranthias genus. However, due to their preference for deepwater habitats, the majority of these fish are seldom seen in the trade; P. inermis perhaps being the species one is most likely to encounter. Despite their scarcity in the shops, these fish are much sought after - largely due to their relative hardiness, attractiveness, easy-to-feed nature, small adult size (most species), and the fact that they do not pick on sessile invertebrates and leave the vast majority of motile invertebrates alone (all but the smallest species should be safe). Although the Hi-Fin Chequered Perchlet is fairly secretive, it makes a fascinating addition to reef aquaria, and often becomes bolder over time. The tank should be mature and furnished with a plethora of live rock to provide feeding opportunities and shady hiding places amongst crevices and caves. As a naturally solitary species, it is best to keep only one per tank, and not with any closely related fish, as despite its general shyness, the Hi-Fin Chequered Perchlet will not appreciate them intruding upon its territory. Tankmates to avoid include species such as dottybacks, grammas, firefish, and some of the wrasses, as many tend to occupy the same niches as the Hi-Fin Chequered Perchlet. Do not house with large, aggressive species as these may intimidate the Hi-Fin Chequered Perchlet, particularly at feeding time. Ideal companions could include Anthias spp., blennies, dwarf angelfish (but not all - research carefully), gobies, and smaller tangs.

These fish are usually observed in pairs, hovering just a few centimetres above the sandy/rubbly substrate at the entrance to their burrow, which they share with an alpheid (pistol) shrimp. Hi-fin Clown Gobies are very passive and make a great addition to peaceful reef aquaria. They are best kept in a compatible male-female pair (your supplier may be able to source you a mated pair) but be sure not to simply place two individuals together from different sources, as if it turns out that they are both males, they will fight - especially in smaller aquaria. The tank should be furnished with plenty of live rock and a reasonable depth of sandy substrate (~10cm/4\"), with a good selection of small rubble pieces that vary in size (not too big to be moved), from which a burrow can be created. Tankmates should be small and peaceful, as pugnacious species will intimidate these diminutive bottom dwellers and prevent them from feeding. As with other members of the same genus, this goby forms a symbiotic partnership with an almost blind alpheid shrimp; together they share the safety of a burrow which the shrimp digs/maintains, and the goby keeps watch for predators. Whilst the shrimp is working, it maintains antennal contact with its goby partner posted at the entrance of the shared burrow. If the shrimp detects the quivering motion of the goby's caudal fin during an unusual situation, it reacts by immediately withdrawing into the depths of the burrow, hastily followed by the goby. The entrance to the shared burrow will be closed at night, and only one entrance is usually open at any one time. The shrimp will only emerge from the burrow whilst it can have tactile contact with the goby. A shrimp partner is not strictly necessary, but if they can be acquired together, they will make such a fascinating display, captivating the observer for hours on end. The usual shrimp that partners the Hi-fin Clown Goby is the Red and White Barred Shrimp Alpheus randalli. Your dealer may be able to acquire the two together, it is certainly worth asking. Ensure that the tank has tight fitting coverslides as Hi-fin Clown Gobies have been know n to jump from open-topped aquaria. For many years, this highly sought-after fish was known simply as \"Stonogobiops sp.\" until its formal description in 2001. The latin name \"yasha\" is in reference to a traditional Japanese female devil; alluding to the large prevomerine teeth of this goby. May also be seen on sale as the White-Ray Shrimp Goby.",
        "feeding": "Will consume a wide range of meaty fare including Mysis shrimp, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, finely chopped krill/prawns etc. If reluctant to feed at first, use a turkey baster to direct some food lower down in the tank to where the goby may be hiding in its burrow. Feed small amounts 3 times per day.",
        "breeding": "Hi-fin Clown Gobies have spawned in the home aquarium, but there are no reports of successfully rearing the larvae past settlement. Just prior to spawning, the belly of the female fish will become noticeably swollen when full of eggs. Spawning occurs inside the cave or under a rock, where an egg mass will be deposited/fertilised. The eggs should hatch within 5-6 days (temperature dependent) and it is believed that the larvae take around a month to undergo metamorphosis."

        "care": "The Hi-fin Flasher Wrasse is known from lagoons and outer reef slopes, above coral and rubble, at depths between 5-35m (16-115ft). Here, these beautiful fish may be observed in small harems as they feed on zooplankton in the water column. Juvenile fish are orange, fading lighter ventrally, and have bright red eyes. As they mature, the body colour intensifies to a rich red-orange, again lighter ventrally, and a series of broken red horizontal stripes start to appear across the flanks. Females remain relatively subdued in colour, with the dominant males much more vibrant in comparison - the horizontal lines on the flanks becoming a bright mixture of red/blue/purple, and the dorsal and anal fins are much larger than those of the females. The dorsal fin of dominant males is quite magnificent, developing 5-7 long filaments, the fin itself adorned with bright red, yellow, or neon blue highlights. The lunate caudal fin of the male is tinged with neon blue/purple, and develops long filaments at the tips. During courtship rituals, the males can undergo spectacular colour changes within seconds as they dash in and out of the rockwork, displaying intense colours and flashing their elaborate fins to attract a female. This is an excellent species for the reef aquarium as it will not harm corals or pick on desirable invertebrates. The tank should be mature and as spacious as possible (this will enable you to keep multiple specimens), with a soft sand substrate. Peaceful by nature and easily bullied, Hi-fin Flasher Wrasse should only be kept alongside passive fish of similar size and peaceable temperament or they may feel too intimidated to venture out to feed. These wrasses are best maintained in small groups with several females to every male, but all individuals must be added simultaneously or else add all females before the male/s. Keeping these fish in small aggregations will encourage natural behaviour, with the males putting on some fantastic displays with fin-flaring, as they attempt to attract a mate. Such groups will only work in spacious quarters, so if the aquarium is smaller, it is best to house a single specimen or a mated pair. Close relatives such as Fairy Wrasses and other small planktivores such as Firefish (which occupy the same niche) are best avoided. At night, these fish rest inside a mucus cocoon created in gaps in the rockwork. Ensure the tank has tight fitting covers, as flasher wrasses will jump from an open topped aquarium. To date, this is the largest known member of the Paracheilinus genus. May also be seen on sale as the Filamented Flasher Wrasse.",

        "care": "The Indian Butterflyfish is a deepwater species known from Mauritius, Reunion, Madagascar, Amirante, Christmas Island, and Cocos-Keeling Atoll south of Sumatra. Here these fish have been observed forming small aggregations of up to 5 individuals at steep outer reef drop offs and areas of black coral and sea fan growths. This small-sized butterflyfish is one of a complex of several similar looking fish and is only sporadically seen in the aquarium trade. This species is regarded as moderately difficult, and is therefore recommended for advanced aquarists only. A good-sized, mature system is requisite, along with ample live rock for the fish to browse upon/hide amongst and a large open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Water temperature should be lower than average on account of these fish hailing from deeper, slightly cooler waters (typically 22-80m/72-263ft). Medium sized specimens tend to acclimatise better to aquarium life, adapting much more quickly to various prepared foods, so try and choose a healthy, alert specimen around 7cm (2.8\") in length. Smaller sized fish may be reluctant to feed, and larger specimens can sometimes be rather finicky, requiring faultless water conditions. An aquarium that has some areas of lush filamentous algae growth will also aid your new fish in settling into its new surroundings; however, as with other butterflyfish species, these fish demand excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of brisk current. Some aquarists have successfully kept the Indian Butterflyfish alongside some of the more noxious soft corals, but this is something of a risk, and they should be observed carefully. Stony corals and many other sessile invertebrates will be constantly nipped at, so unfortunately must be avoided. Keep only one Indian Butterflyfish per tank (unless a mated pair is acquired) and not with any other butterflyfish as they will squabble over territories. Whilst they can be a little shy when first introduced, providing them with ample retreats amongst the live rock will ensure they quickly gain confidence and venture out into the open. Once settled, these intelligent, peaceful fish actually become very assertive feeders, competing with most other fish species, and they will also be most curious of any activity in and around their aquarium. Tankmates should be of similar size and temperament. As mentioned above, C. mitratus forms part of a complex of similar-looking, deepwater fish known as the Tinker's Complex, which also includes C. burgessi, C. declivis, C. flavocoronatus, and C. tinkeri. Where these species overlap in the wild, it is not uncommon for them to hybridise. May also be seen on sale as Mitratus Butterflyfish.",

At night, these fish have been observed digging holes below coral bases for shelter. The Indian Trigger has a subtle beauty and is one of the few triggerfish species that can be safely kept in most reef aquaria. With the exception of sponges, sessile invertebrates are typically ignored, but it must be mentioned that larger Indian Triggerfish are likely to eat any ornamental shrimp or snails that they come across. These fish are therefore ideal for those spacious reef set ups without any crustaceans, gastropods, or sponges. These fish have a voracious appetite and good filtration is essential, along with areas of brisk water movement. Tankmates should be chosen with care as Indian Triggerfish, whilst not anywhere near as belligerent as other members of the family, can still be moderately aggressive. Keep only one per tank and with confident companions that are of similar size or larger, or tankmates that are slightly smaller but more-aggressive.

This is a species that should be added to the reef tank with a bit of caution; although it should not trouble corals, it will feed on a variety of invertebrates (see Reef Aquarium Compatibility section below).

        "care": "The Japanese Pygmy Angelfish is known from southern and central Japan and the north-western Hawaiian Islands, where they are found over rocky and coral reefs, at depths between 12-60m (39-197ft). This beautiful angelfish is rarely seen in the trade, and as such, tends to command a hefty price tag when it is available. Although it does not grow to a huge size, this is one of the larger Centropyge species and is an active fish that does require a good amount of space. The bigger the tank, the better, as then the fish is much less likely to continually pick at any one particular sessile invertebrate and cause irreparable damage. Also, ensuring that the fish is well-fed means that it should not pose any real threat to reef aquaria - although occasional specimens may nip at some invertebrate life (see below) it should be noted that this only usually occurs if dietary requirements and feeding frequency are not being met. Careful observation is recommended. The Japanese Pygmy Angelfish should be kept singly and not with any other members of the Centropyge genus. Although this is a fish that can be quite shy when first introduced to the aquarium, and may take a little time to settle, once it has become accustomed to its surroundings, it can be rather territorial when new species (particularly docile/peaceful fish) are introduced to the tank afterwards. For this reason, we recommend that the Japanese Pygmy Angelfish is the last addition to the aquarium. Good water movement is much appreciated, and plenty of live rock is essential for shelter/grazing. Acclimatise carefully and ensure that the tank is well mature before adding a Japanese Pygmy Angelfish. Keep water quality high at all times. The fish pictured here is a juvenile specimen; as the fish matures, the pattern and colours will change with the anterior half taking on a much more orange hue with the spots on the flanks becoming finer and more numerous. The ocellus on the posterior of the dorsal fin will also disappear. A stunning fish in both juvenile and adult colouration. May also be seen on sale as the Interruptus Angelfish.",
        "feeding": "Should be offered a varied diet including Spirulina & marine algae as well as meaty fare such as vitamin/Spirulina-enriched brineshrimp, Mysis shrimp, special sponge-based Angelfish preparations, and finely chopped krill/squid/cockle/mussel. Feed small amounts 3 times per day.",
        "breeding": "The Japanese Pygmy Angelfish has not been bred in the home aquarium, although it is being bred commercially on a small scale. In the wild, these fish form distinct pairs and eggs are scattered in open water."

        "care": "The Jewel Algae Blenny is known from shallow, protected inshore reefs and estuaries, at depths of 1-15m (3.3-49ft). Here, they are observed near to reef/rubble margins and at sand/weed interfaces. The Jewel Algae Blenny is often regarded as a utility fish for helping to control various algal growths in the aquarium. However, these are very personable fish and are fascinating to observe, regardless of their excellent ability at removing and consuming algae. The tank must be well established, and of a good size; algae blennies have been known to starve in smaller quarters once the main food source has been depleted and not had time to re-establish. When Jewel Algae Blennies feed, skip over rocks, graze d\u00c3\u00a9cor and generally go about their business, they tend to stir up detritus where it goes into suspension and is then removed by the filtration. As this species requires a mature tank, it works out well that this should be the last fish added to the tank, preferably at a size around 2.5\"\u009d where it should not be over-dominant. However, in general, Jewel Algae Blennies can be fairly feisty and quite territorial over the bottom of the aquarium, particularly as they mature; therefore it is best to keep only one per tank, and careful consideration given to tankmates - avoiding other blennies and similar-looking bottom dwelling species such as gobies (unless you are blessed with a tank of vast proportions incorporating a huge number of visual barriers amongst the rockwork, and more than enough food to go round on a continual basis). It should be noted that Jewel Algae Blennies will not feed on every kind of algae - they particularly relish the filamentous type, but will ignore bubble and slime algae. Ensure corals are firmly attached, as large algae blennies may disturb them with their feeding habits and when hopping about looking for a suitable perch from which they can survey their domain. May also be seen on sale as the Starry Blenny.",
        "feeding": "By far and away, this species does best if a decent growth of filamentous algae is present in the aquarium for the fish to harvest at its leisure. Also offer plenty of vegetable matter, including frozen foods that contain marine algae and Spirulina. Nori (dried seaweed), algae flake and algae wafers formulated for marine fish are usually met with much enthusiasm. If you have space in a well lit sump, filamentous algae can be cultured on pieces of rock, and occasionally rotated with some of the pieces in the main display aquarium.",
        "breeding": "This species has spawned in the home aquarium, but the young have not yet been raised past the larval stage. During courtship, the male turns white in colour but retains dark colouration on the head. The bright yellow eggs are demersal and adhesive, and are attached to the substrate via a filamentous, adhesive pad. They typically hatch in 8 days."

Adults are often found in pairs, whereas juveniles may be seen in small groups, staying close to corals or under ledges. This species is best maintained in a \"fish only, with live rock\" aquarium where it would pose no danger to corals, ornamental snails, shrimp and other small prized inverts. Tankmates should be chosen carefully; species with long fins should be avoided, as occasional puffer specimens will nip and leave their tell-tale circular holes in the fins. This behavior is more likely to become apparent in small areas, so adequate space must be given. Jewel Pufferfish should be kept singly, unless a mated male-female pair can be acquired, and even then, they should be watched carefully lest the male becomes too aggressive. Will fight with other members of the Canthigastergenus. This species is mimicked by the filefish Paraluteres arqat, which, in the wild, shoals with the Jewel Pufferfish so that predators avoid it - assuming it to be one of the toxic puffers. This mimic filefish should not be housed with its model puffer within the confines of an aquarium, as the pufferfish is likely to pick on it. As with all pufferfish, it should never be deliberately provoked into inflating itself. When handling this fish, it is best to herd it into a container, rather than using a net and lifting the fish clear of the water where it may ingest air. This species was once thought to be synonymous with the Papuan Toby (C. papua) but they are now considered distinct species. C. solandri is replaced by the Pearl Toby (C. margaritata)in the Red Sea.

        "breeding": "Jewel pufferfish have not been bred in captivity. In the wild, this species is known to form distinct pairs during spawning. The female will signal her readiness to spawn by displaying her belly (which will be swollen with eggs) to the male and he will then follow her closely. This courtship ritual of showing and following takes some time, with the resulting eggs laid/fertilized in a demersal nest, usually consisting of plant material such as within large tufts of algae. The female may spend a little time waggling her anal fin to push the eggs further into the clump, but after that, neither of the adults are said to show any parental care."

The Keyhole Angelfish is of an intense dark blue-black coloration with a contrasting white \"keyhole\" marking on the flanks. The pelvic fins are bright yellow, and this same vivid yellow color also runs along the edge of the anal fin; some specimens also have a narrow blue margin around the caudal fin.

        "care": "The Kiri Triggerfish is a relatively recent discovery, and was formally described in 2013. This small triggerfish is known only from Kiritimati (Christmas Island) in the Line Islands chain in the Central Pacific. These islands are an expansive collection of breathtakingly beautiful low-lying atolls with partially or fully enclosed lagoons and coral islands with surrounding reefs. At Kiritimati, this triggerfish has been most frequently observed inhabiting a fairly deep zone between 90-100m (296-328ft), below a significant thermocline at around 85m (279ft). The water in the area above the thermocline measured 25-28 \u00b0C (typical reef temperatures), and was 20-22 \u00b0C below. No X. greenei were observed above the thermocline, but it proved to be a common species in the region below. The habitat itself consists of a gently sloping hard substratum with patches of rocks, coral rubble, and small boltholes. Below 100m, this gives way to a vertical drop-off and another thermocline (the temperature measuring 10-14 \u00b0C below this) and no X. greenei were observed in this area. The Kiri Triggerfish is one of the few triggerfish species that can be safely kept in most reef aquaria. Sessile invertebrates are typically ignored, but it must be mentioned that larger Kiri Triggerfish are likely to eat any ornamental shrimp they come across. These fish are therefore ideal for those spacious reef set ups without any crustaceans. Kiri Triggerfish can be kept in a mated pair, or even in groups if introduced simultaneously. Filtration should be efficient and the water well oxygenated with areas of brisk current. Although this species may be a little shy when first introduced to the aquarium, the fish will soon gain confidence and may even spit water at the surface in anticipation of feeding time. Tankmates should be chosen with care as Kiri Triggerfish, whilst not anywhere near as belligerent as other members of the family, can still be moderately aggressive. Tiny, placid fish should be avoided. As with all fish, personalities can differ and there are occasional reports of \"rogue fish\". The vast majority of specimens will be safe in a reef environment, but we advise that you observe your individual fish carefully. As these triggerfish are often found at reasonable depths, the water temperature should be kept below 24 \u00b0C, and introduction to brighter lighting should be carried out gradually. The six known species of Xanthichthys triggerfish can be split into two groups, according to the number of pigmented cheek grooves, either 3 or 5. X. greenei, like the similar-looking X. lineopunctatus from the Western Indian Ocean, and X. ringens from the Western Atlantic, all have 3 (vs. 5 in X. auromarginatus, X. caeruleolineatus, and X. mento). The colour of X. greenei, X. lineopunctatus, and X. ringens is almost identical; however, X. greenei has a lower body scale count, body spots are reduced to a few speckles dorsally, and it attains a much smaller standard length (15.4cm vs 25/26cm).",

Be sure to add the entire group simultaneously, or else add all females before the male. Large males will behave aggressively towards other fairy wrasses and other small wrasse species introduced after them, and unless you are blessed with a system of vast proportions, do not attempt to keep more than one male together. With regards to aquascaping, it is important to provide these fish with plenty of live rock to hide amongst should they feel threatened. Newly acclimatised fish may be quite shy, but in the presence of peaceful tankmates, they should soon gain much confidence and swim out in open water areas. It is best not to house Koi Fairy Wrasses with large, intimidating species such as some of the bigger Angels and Tangs.

        "care": "The Common Seahorse, also known as the Golden, Spotted, or Kuda Seahorse, is known from seagrass beds and areas with abundant marine algae, in shallow seaward reefs, estuaries, and harbours. Adults are usually found in pairs, feeding near the substrate on various small crustaceans, but some specimens have been found in open water, attached to drifting Sargassum some 20km (12.4miles) from the shore. Most specimens seen in the aquatics trade will have been captive bred, the majority by the Tropical Marine Centre (TMC). This helps to take pressure off of the wild populations, currently listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species and CITES II listed. Interestingly, the common Seahorse has two main colour phases: black and yellow. The black form can be grey to black with a somewhat grainy-looking appearance, and the yellow form may be cream, yellow, or golden, with fairly large dark spots (especially in the females) and a black line running from their chest to their abdomen. The golden phase seahorses are capable of dramatic colour change, depending on their surroundings, mood, or stress, and they may take on an olive appearance when first adjusting to their new home. Other variable colour forms are far less common, but some individuals may show a mixture of black and yellow. Instead of scales, all seahorses have a layer of skin that is stretched over bony plates, visible as a series of rings around the trunk. The eyes can move independently of one another, and locomotion is powered by rapidly oscillating the dorsal fin, whilststeering with the pectorals. In this species, the coronet is typically of a low to medium height and rounded, sometimes with a cup-like depression in the top, and with a noticeable overhang at the back. The skin is not particularly spiny in this species, instead, there are low, rounded bumps, and 11 conspicuous trunk rings (plus 34-38 tail rings). In order for seahorses to thrive in captivity, they are best maintained in mature species-only aquaria, where they will not be subjected to boisterous companions and outcompeted for food. Ideally, the aquarium will provide plenty of stationary branching decor which they can grab onto with their amazing prehensile tails e.g. gorgonian skeletons, plastic plants, orlive marine greenery. As they are masters of camouflage, providing areas of golden-huedd\u00c3\u00a9cor is known to encourage gold phase specimens to take on their most intense colours. Water flow should be gentle so that these poor swimmers are not blown into solid surfaces; gentle current also having the added benefit of increasing their chances of finding plenty of food items. As steady feedings are required,regular partial water changes are essential (be very careful in matching the temperature and salinity of the new water to that which you have taken from the tank). The use of a small protein skimmer can be very beneficial. In addition to the requisite branching decor as mentioned above, a live sand bed plus some live rock will help to culture various prey items such as amphipods and isopods, which the seahorses can browse upon in between the times when the aquarist adds food to the tank. Many find that an adjacent refugium is extremely beneficial in keeping a constant supply of live food available to their seahorses. Before purchase, ensure that the seahorses are in good health and are feeding well (ask the shop to demonstrate). When seahorses are to be taken from an aquarium i.e. when purchasing or if moving them to different quarters, always ensure that they are herded into a suitable container or bag under the water; if they are lifted free from the water, they may well ingest air which can cause them problems. Likewise, many species can all too easily become entangled in nets and then subsequently damaged when trying to free them. The herding under technique really is the kindest method of capture. Please plan your seahorse aquarium carefully and responsibly - the primary lack of success in keeping syngnathids in captivity is starvation, which is so easily avoided. To reiterate: (1) provide a mature, stable, and gentle, \"non-competitive\" environment with appropriate decor, (2) ensure that there is an ongoing supply of various nutritious foods via very regular feedings, living sand/rock, and a fishless refugium, and (3) choose healthy captive-bred livestock that is provento be feeding well, and is bagged for you without exposure to air. Seahorsesare not suitable for beginners.",

        "breeding": "The Common Seahorse is\nregularly captive-bred for the trade, taking pressure off the vulnerable wild\npopulations; it has also been bred in the home aquarium. This species is\nmonogamous, and prior to breeding, the couple will begin an elaborate courtship\nritual where the male dances around the female, whilst changing colour and\nproducing clicking sounds. After a time, the pair will entwine their tails and\nfloat together over the substrate. They will then turn belly to belly and the\nfemale will insert her ovipositor into the males brood pouch (which is located\non his belly, under the tail) and lays her eggs. The male then fertilises the\neggs, which subsequently become embedded into the walls of the pouch. The brood\nsize is quite variable, depending on the age and size of the parents, but will\ntypically number around 200-300 on average. The courtship ritual will then\ncontinue for some time, even after the male has become pregnant. Some 20-28\ndays later, the male goes into labour (usually at night), and this can be quite\na strenuous task that involves much thrusting, sometimes over the course of\nseveral hours, until all of the young seahorses are released. There is no\nparental care, the pelagic young are fully independent and fend for themselves,\nusually attaching themselves to decor or greenery near the surface. They measure\naround 7mm/0.28\" when born, and can be fed baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) straight away. It may\nbe of interest to know that 5 generations of this species have been\nsuccessfully kept and raised at one public aquarium."

        "care": "Laboute's Fairy Wrasse is a remarkable-looking fish from the rubbly, seaward coral reefs of New Caledonia and the Loyalty Islands, and westwards on to the Great Barrier Reef. It is most commonly encountered at depths between 7-55m (23-181ft), where it feeds on zooplankton in large groups, just above the substrate. These groups are composed mainly of females and juveniles, the males being more solitary. Generally, in female fish, the upper head and body has a slightly more subdued yellowish brown tone, with three vibrant magenta stripes across the flanks and a lavender/white lower body. Sub-adult females have redder stripes with a small black spot at the base of the caudal fin. Male fish exhibit similar colours and patterns to the females, although they usually display more intense colouration on the head area and the magenta stripes are often edged in yellow, and with the ventral portions of the body frequently a deep lavender-blue colour. These exotic-looking fish can also change colour depending on mood and time of day. Laboute's Fairy Wrasse is a peaceful, active species that is well suited to mature reef aquaria. They should be provided with consistently high water quality, decent current, and plenty of aeration. Supply an abundance of hiding places amongst the live rock; these fish may be quite shy initially, but should soon gain confidence, especially if they know they have safe places to retreat to if necessary. Keep only one male per tank and if planning on keeping a group (ideally comprising one male and several females), be sure to add the entire group simultaneously, or else add all females before the male. Large males will behave aggressively towards other fairy wrasses and other small wrasse species introduced after them. It has been known for adult males to lose some of their colouration in captivity when they are maintained alone, and keeping a small harem tends to prevent this from occurring. Do not attempt to house with intimidating fish such as larger species of Angels and Tangs as their presence may make the fairy wrasses feel threatened and then refuse to come out and feed. Having said that, they can eventually become quite boisterous at feeding times, so ensure that any passive feeders do not miss out. It is imperative that the tank has tightly fitting coverslides and no escape holes, as these fish are notorious for jumping from open topped aquaria. May also be seen on sale as the Magenta-streaked Wrasse or the Northern Purple Wrasse.",

The angelfish from the genus Genicanthus are unusual in that they are not classed as true dwarf angels, yet they remain relatively small sized fish. They also display a remarkable sexual dimorphism. This particular species is ideal for the reef aquarium that has been constructed with lots of shady overhangs and crevices amongst the live rock. Although it does not grow to a huge size, Lamarck's Angelfish is a very active species that does require a good amount of space. Keep either singly, as a male-female pair, or one male with a harem of several females, but never house a male G. lamarck with another male or with any other members of the Genicanthus genus - especially those of similar appearance. Will usually ignore some of the more placid species of dwarf angelfish from the Centropyge genus, but as each fish is an individual and behaviour is certainly not set in stone, do observe very carefully. These fish have been known to pick on small planktivores such as wreckfish (Pseudanthias spp.), fairy and flasher wrasses, and fire fish, but they are perfectly safe with soft and stony corals. Good water movement is essential, and plenty of live rock will be appreciated for shelter/grazing (plenty of dimly lit areas will also help with the settling in period).

These bright yellow fish with their delightful, intricate crosshatch pattern are often observed in pairs, feeding on  anemones, polychaete worms, and octocorallian/scleractinian coral polyps, to depths of 15m (49ft). In larger aquaria, the Latticed Butterflyfish can be kept alongside other fairly peaceable butterflyfish and even members of its own kind, if they are introduced simultaneously. Ideally, other tankmates will also be fairly peaceful. This fish does best in mature aquaria containing plenty of live rock for the fish to browse on and forage amongst, and this will also provide plenty of visual barriers should the fish feel they need to dart to safety. Unfortunately, this species is not to be trusted with corals, zoanthids, or anemones. A large open swimming space should be left along the front of the tank, as these fish are energetic swimmers. As with all butterflyfishes, this species demands excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of decent current. Although tending to be of a fairly nocturnal nature in the wild, these fish adapt well to aquarium lighting and feeding schedules, and often become very active during the day. Interestingly, the Latticed Butterflyfish has the ability to change appearance to a shadowy form with a dark blotch on the anterior part of the body when wanting to blend into its surroundings at night, or when threatened.  It may display this pattern during the day for some time after it is initially placed in its new home, but even so, it should feed and behave quite normally.

These fish are generally safe in the reef aquarium, providing they are well fed. A mature tank is necessary to help ensure that your Lavender Tang settles in well; in particular these fish enjoy grazing upon filamentous algae growing upon the decor. Arrange the live rock to create a sloping reef, with plenty of boltholes for the fish, should they feel the need to dash for cover at any time.

The Leaf Scorpionfish makes a wonderful aquarium inhabitant, although it is not suitable for a community reef set-up; indeed, this fish is best kept singly or with several of its own kind. If tankmates are desired, ensure that they are not small enough to be eaten, and also make sure they are not kept alongside any boisterous fish or those that may not be able to resist picking at the leaflike body (e.g. butterflyfish). There should be plenty of perches created with the live rockwork, and ideally areas with cultured algaes that the fish can rest amongst. Although this species has a relatively small mouth for a scorpionfish, it is predatory and will take small fishes. It is best fed on live grass shrimp and slowly weaned onto frozen fare. Twice a month, this fish will moult, with the skin breaking off in the head region first, and it is imperative to keep water conditions at their best at all times. Prior to moulting, the fish may show less interest in food, but once complete, it will soon revert to normal behaviour and the skin colour will be brighter.

        "care": "The Lemonpeel Angelfish is known from coral rich, shallow lagoons and exposed seaward reefs from the lower surge zone, to a depth of 50m (164 ft). Juvenile fish (which sport a large, distinctive black ocellus edged in blue on each flank) are very secretive and stay close to the safety of corals and small crevices, whereas adults venture further afield.\nThe Lemonpeel Angelfish requires a mature aquarium with plenty of rockwork, on which it can graze for the microalgae, and in which it can hide. This vibrantly-coloured fish is rather notorious for picking on zoanthids and LPS corals (see Reef Aquarium Compatibility below) so caution is advised when adding to a reef set up; the larger the tank, the better, as the fish is then less likely to continually pick at any particular sessile invertebrate and cause irreparable damage. A frequent, varied feeding regime will also help in this respect.\nLike most other members of the Centropyge genus, the Lemonpeel Angelfish does not grow very large, but nevertheless, it is an active species which requires plenty of space. The least problematic combinations of fish come from mixing them with dissimilar tank mates and combining them with other dwarf angels can be problematic unless certain measures are taken. As they're protogynous, all young individuals are potentially female, and animals of equal size are likely to clash over hierarchy with dominant individuals becoming male. For this reason, it's best to keep them singly or in pairs or groups where a significant size difference makes dominance straightforward with minimal fighting. This also applies when attempting to house different species of Centropyge together and generally speaking, it's always best to add smaller individuals to established ones. This mimics the natural state where young fish settle out the plankton and into existing communities of territorial fishes. The greater the difference in size, the less aggression will be displayed although solitary fish will often be overstimulated if they've been kept alone for an extended period. Ritualised display postures appease aggression in the more dominant fish, but close supervision may be needed and keeping multiple dwarf angels is best attempted in large aquaria with plenty of rockwork. Buying existing pairs or groups is easier, as the stressful first date scenario can be avoided.\nNatural hybrids of this fish and the Half-black Angelfish (C. vrolikii) are sometimes available. Interestingly, the Lemonpeel Angelfish is mimicked by juvenile Acanthurus pyroferus tangs, who probably benefit from the large spines below the gill covers that predators know are a feature of dwarf angels. As the surgeonfish develops its own blades for defence, this protective deception is no longer needed by adults.",

        "care": "The Leopard Wrasse is one of 11 currently known species of Macropharyngodon and although all are incredibly beautiful, this genera is considered very delicate and does have some specialist care requirements that must be fulfilled by the advanced aquarist if these fish are to acclimatise well to life in captivity. In the wild, the Leopard Wrasse is found over mixed sand, rubble, and coral areas of sub-tidal reef flats and outer lagoons/seaward reefs to depths of 30m (98ft), where it occurs singly, in pairs, or in large aggregations of females, and is usually observed browsing for gastropods and foraminiferans amongst the substratum. This leopard wrasse requires a very mature, spacious aquarium with plenty of live rock and sand that supports its natural diet on an ongoing basis, if it is to thrive. If added to a newly set up tank, it will starve to death. There should be plenty of hiding places amongst the rockwork, with enough depth of substrate (7.5cm/3\" of fine sand) for the fish to bury if it feels threatened. Because of the difficulties in feeding this leopard wrasse, it should not be kept with fish that require a similar food source to survive, as otherwise one species may out-compete the other. There should be relatively calm areas in the tank that allow it to locate food successfully. Tankmates should be peaceful and of an easygoing nature so that the Leopard Wrasse does not feel harassed and subsequently stops venturing out to feed. Groups can sometimes be kept together successfully (added simultaneously) but larger numbers should only ever be considered for exceptionally large aquaria, as in the average sized aquarium, natural prey will deplete too quickly with that many fish requiring the same diet. Do not house with other Macropharyngodon species or pugnacious dottybacks and hawkfish, as they will fight for territory. When choosing your leopard wrasse, check that its body is not emaciated, and that it is actively searching for food. It is not uncommon for a newly added leopard wrasse to hide beneath the substrate whilst it adjusts to its new surroundings and altered circadian rhythm; in such cases it is best to leave them be, they will usually begin to explore within a couple of days. These fish require stable and optimal water conditions at all times, so a good filtration and maintenance regime is a must. Ensure that the aquarium has tight fitting coverslides with no small gaps in the hood, as these fish are expert jumpers. May also be seen on sale as Blackspotted Leopard Wrasse, Eastern Leopard Wrasse, Guinea Fowl Wrasse, Reticulated Wrasse, or Vermiculated Wrasse. Not recommended for beginners.",
        "feeding": "Very challenging to feed. This species will spend many hours searching out micro-invertebrates living in amongst the live rock and substrate. It must be provided with natural prey. A constant supply of tiny live foods for this purpose can be cultured in a fishless refugium. Will often take vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, and sometimes Mysis, but this alone will not provide enough sustenance.",

This bottom-feeding fish is a solitary species, although several other individuals will often be observed fairly nearby, albeit keeping a reasonable distance apart from one another. The large adult size of the magnificent Long-Barbel Goatfish regrettably makes this species an unsuitable addition to all but the most spacious of showtanks or public aquaria. These nervous fish require plenty of open swimming and foraging space, ample hiding places, a substrate that is not too sharp, and non-aggressive tankmates that are larger than the goatfish (which will predate on fish small enough to fit in their mouths). Tight fitting coverslides on the tank are also an absolute must, as these fish are expert jumpers. Powerful filtration and protein skimming are essential as these active fish have a high metabolism and require small feedings several times per day. Most goatfishes will habitually grub through the substrate with their two impressive unbranched sensory chin barbels, so it is inevitable that a fair amount of debris will be stirred up into the system whenever it disturbs the substrate, hence the importance of decent filtration. A high standard of water quality should be maintained at all times, with a good level of oxygenation. Pictured above is a juvenile specimen; adults grow into much stockier fish, the large underslung jaw becomes much more prominent, and overall colouration can take on a rosy red hue, darker dorsally. The dusky basal stripe in the second dorsal fin and a pale area at end of the black body stripe (the latter more visible in adults) distinguishes this species from the similar-looking Dot Dash Goatfish (P. barberinus).",

        "care": "The Longfin Anthias is a deepwater fish known from caves and coral rubble along steep reef drop-offs or channel walls, and may be observed as far down as 120m (394ft). This secretive species congregates in sizeable shoals to feed on zooplankton, crustacean larvae, and fish eggs, with one male fish overseeing a large harem of females. This is a delicate species that is really only suitable for advanced aquarists with mature, dimly-lit, deepwater tanks. In the confines of the home aquarium, it is best to keep either a solitary specimen, or else a group comprising of a single male and at least 8 females. Unfortunately, smaller groups will result in squabbles, where the weakest fish is likely to be picked on and prevented from feeding, eventually succumbing to being bullied by the others. These large shoals should only be considered if the tank is of XXL proportions \" if the tank is of average size, it really is best to house a single specimen only. Longfin Anthias are relatively peaceable and somewhat shy. They should not be housed with direct food competitors or with docile species such as firefish. Conversely, ensure that their tankmates are not overly large, belligerent species either, or the Longfin Anthias will feel intimidated. Longfin Anthias are usually perfectly safe in a mature deep reef set up, typically swimming out and about in the open water areas and ignoring sessile invertebrates. It is essential that illumination is kept subdued if these fish are going to acclimatise successfully though; the bright lighting of a typical shallow-water reef is cited as one of the key reasons for these fish not adjusting well to life in the home aquarium. Provide plenty of shady crevices and overhangs amongst the rockwork, ensuring all structures are stable. Likewise, the temperature of the tank water is also crucial: as these fish inhabit deepwater drop-offs where they are often exposed to an upwelling of colder currents, the aquarium water temperature should not be allowed to rise above 25 \u00b0C (77 deg F), so a means of chilling the water may be necessary during hot summer months. A varied diet is a must to keep the fish in good health and for them to display their vibrant colouration. Ideally they will be fed small amounts several times per day (see below). An attached refugium cultivating copepods and amphipods can also really help to provide a steady, ongoing supply of nutritious live food to keep this active planktivore content. Powerful filtration and protein skimming, plus a good maintenance regime are essential for maintaining optimal water quality despite the heavy nutrient input. As these fish inhabit areas of moderate to strong currents in the wild, they require fairly brisk water movement in the home aquarium - a high level of oxygenation at all times being of utmost importance. There are a considerable number of geographical variants of this species, and all are very eyecatching. The fish in the above picture are from the Coral Sea. Pseudanthias ventralis ventralis is replaced by the similar-looking P. hawaiiensis at the Hawaiian and Johnston Islands, and in time, further insular variants may also receive full taxonomic upgrade.

When ready to spawn, the male fish will prepare a spawning site - usually a cave \"\u201c and will then lure the female into it, where up to 500 eggs will be laid/fertilised. The parents will guard the eggs until they hatch. The tiny larvae initially feed off their yolk sacs, but will require appropriately sized foodstuffs soon after."

        "care": "The Magnificent Foxface is a highly prized member of the venomous rabbitfish family. This species sports spectacular red colouration along the dorsal fin, most noticeable when its fins are held erect. In the wild, the Red Foxface inhabits coral reefs, where it feeds upon algae and tiny invertebrates. Juvenile specimens tend to be very secretive and hide amongst the corals, whereas larger adults are often observed swimming in pairs. The aquarium should have powerful filtration and circulation, and should offer plenty of dark hiding places amongst the rockwork. If adding this species to a reef aquarium, be aware that occasional specimens do have a taste for certain coral polyps, particularly those that are feeling hungry, so be sure to observe carefully and ensure the fish is receiving enough food. The Red Foxface has a small mouth that is specially adapted for browsing on algae (the main constituent of its diet) and will consume both undesirable and desirable algae species. They must receive regular offerings of greenfoods in their diet, otherwise they will fade in colour and their health will deteriorate. Meaty foods can be offered, and indeed will be accepted, but it is very important that rabbitfish receive a decent amount of algae-based foodstuffs as part of their daily nourishment. Red Foxfaces tend to be intolerant of their own kind within the confines of the aquarium and are best kept singly, with the exception of a bonded male-female pair. Unrelated fish species will be ignored, most giving the Red Foxface a wide berth because of the venomous spines on its dorsal and anal fins. Needless to say, this is a fish that must be handled with much care when catching and acclimatising; ideally it should be gently herded into a submerged fish-bag or solid container, rather than risk using a net to lift it from the water. The fish is likely to erect its fins, entangling the sturdy spines in the netting, and at the same time there is the chance of the aquarist receiving a very painful sting. This species is capable of changing colour to a blotchy \"fright pattern\" at the blink of an eye. This can be due to a sudden shock (e.g. someone coming into the room where the aquarium is situated), an altercation with another fish, lights coming on too suddenly etc. Ideally the tank should be situated away from high areas of foot traffic. These fish also adopt the same blotchy pattern when resting at night. *If you are accidentally stung by your Foxface, it is best to seek medical advice immediately.*",
        "feeding": "Offer a varied diet that consists mainly of vegetable matter e.g. frozen foods containing Spirulina, plus marine algae, Nori (dried seaweed) and green marine flake food. Will accept small meaty foods such as Mysis shrimp, vitamin/Spirulina enriched brineshrimp, finely chopped krill etc, but this should be as a supplement to the predominantly herbivorous diet. A mature tank with a healthy growth of algae on the rockwork is immensely beneficial in providing the Foxface with natural grazing opportunities.",

        "care": "The exquisitely coloured Majestic Angelfish is a shy species best suited to spacious mature aquaria. In the wild, it is found inhabiting coral rich lagoons, channels, and protected outer reef slopes, mostly swimming solitary. In the home aquarium, live rock is considered essential for the wellbeing of this species, providing grazing opportunities as well as a multitude of hiding places. A difficult species to maintain, experienced dedicated hobbyists are urged to source a healthy medium sized specimen as both small and very large fish do not tend to adapt quite so well to captivity. In any case, it is fairly unusual to see tiny Majestic Angelfish offered for sale \" the juvenile pattern is remarkably different to that of the adults and is seldom seen. Keep only one per tank and not with any other angelfish species, as they will fight. The gill cover spine is a formidable weapon, used both for defence and aggression (take care when netting or handling these fish). Juveniles are particularly reclusive, but adults should become bolder with age. As mentioned previously, the tank should be aquascaped so that it has a decent amount of bolt-holes amongst the decor where the fish can retreat to if necessary. In fact the more places to hide, the more likely you are to see more of your Majestic Angel; this is because the fish will gain confidence in knowing it can retreat out of sight quickly should it feel the need. Do not introduce similarly shaped/coloured fish into the aquarium after your Majestic Angel has become established in the tank, as although not as aggressive as some of the other larger angel species, it will behave very antagonistically towards these newcomers. Unfortunately, Majestic Angels will nip at LPS corals, some soft corals such as Xenia sp., and also clam mantles. However, most SPS corals and some of the more noxious soft corals should be ignored. Filtration should be oversized, with highly efficient protein skimming and powerful circulation. Many experts consider this species to reside in the \"Euxiphipops complex\" (a sub-genus), along with 2 other species, namely the Bluefaced Angel (P. xanthometopon) and the Sixbanded Angel (P. sexstriatus). The latter two are considered extremely challenging to keep in the home aquarium, and none are suitable for beginners. With such a huge family of fish to choose from, there are many Angelfish species that are much hardier and better suited to captivity than these beauties from the Euxiphipops complex.",
        "feeding": "Offer a varied diet which includes frozen foods containing Spirulina, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, Mysis shrimp, finely chopped shrimp etc, plus marine flake food and greens, including Nori. Does best in mature aquaria with a healthy microalgae growth. Frozen rations prepared especially for angelfish are good if you can find them, particularly those containing sponges. Garlic additives are excellent for those specimens that appear a little reluctant to take prepared foods, although you should always check with your dealer that your angelfish is feeding prior to purchase.

Here it is found in small groups, over silty substrates with coral and rubble, to depths of 18m (59ft). This is a popular aquarium fish that should only ever be added to a well established reef tank, where there will be plenty of live rock and live substrate that supports its natural diet of tiny crustaceans, worms, and small sessile invertebrate life. If added to a newly set up tank, it will starve to death. There should be plenty of hiding places amongst the rockwork, with enough depth of substrate for the fish to bury if it feels threatened. Never add this bottom dwelling fish to a tank housing anemones, as it could easily end up being consumed. Because of the difficulties in feeding the Mandarin, it should not be kept with fish that require a similar food source to survive, as otherwise one species may out-compete the other. There should be relatively calm areas in the tank that allow the Mandarin to locate food successfully. Tankmates should be peaceful and of an easygoing nature so that the Mandarin does not feel harassed and subsequently stops venturing out to feed. It is best to keep a single specimen only, or a compatible male-female pair (females usually prefer a larger sized male). Groups should only be considered for exceptionally spacious aquaria, as in the average sized aquarium, males will fight vigorously. Not to be kept alongside the similar species S. picturatus. When choosing your Mandarin, check that its body is not emaciated, and that it is actively searching for food. This fish is not recommended for beginners. May also be seen on sale as Striped Mandarin, Mandarinfish, or Mandarin Dragonet.",
        "feeding": "Very challenging to feed. This species will spend many hours searching out tiny invertebrates living in amongst the live rock and substrate. It must be provided with natural prey.

Provide a large, mature aquarium with plenty of live rock that forms dark nooks and crannies. The elongated snout allows the Margined Coralfish to search for food morsels deep amongst the decor. Many soft corals are safe enough with a well-fed Margined Coralfish in the tank, as are small-polyped-stony (SPS) corals; however, some specimens will nibble at zoanthids, feather dusters, sponges, polychaete worms, anemones, and long-polyped-stony (LPS) corals and inflict a fair bit of damage. Keep only one per tank, and not with any other butterflyfish species. Tankmates should be of a peaceful nature, otherwise this shy fish may not feel confident enough to venture out for food. Will help to control the pest anemone Aiptasia. Most unfortunately, this is a species that has a rather irregular survival rate in captivity, so it is imperative that the conscientious aquarist is certain that all its needs can be met, before considering purchase. The main difficulty seems to arise with feeding these wild-caught fish; some specimens will take food right away, others may need more enticement with a wide variety of foodstuffs. Garlic and vitamin enriched foods can be very beneficial for the settling in phase. As with all butterflyfishes, this sensitive species demands excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of decent current. Juvenile fish sport a posterior bar and dorsal fin spot, which fade and eventually disappear with age/growth.

Frozen glassworm (white mosquito larvae) is nutritious and might help to get your fish interested in eating. Try to soak all frozen foods in a vitamin supplement prior to feeding. It is rare for these fish to take dried foods, but they are most certainly worth a go. If you have a refugium with living rock, try rotating pieces of this rock with pieces from the main tank, so that the Margined Coralfish has a continual supply of natural foodstuffs to forage for. These fish will need to be fed in small amounts several times per day.",

Here, this reclusive, nocturnal species may be found hiding in dark caves and crevices by day, emerging at night to feed. In the home aquarium, this hardy, eye-catching fish is safe with corals, but does not appreciate the bright lighting that many sessile invertebrates require. If it is to be kept in a reef setting, ensure that there are a multitude of dark caves and crevices amongst the rockwork so that it can take refuge during the day, and preferably some areas of the tank that have more subdued lighting. Tankmates must be chosen with care, as adult Marine Bettas are capable of taking small fish and ornamental shrimps; however, they are a great choice for reef set-ups that contain corals and medium sized peaceful fish only. This fish behaves very shyly, especially when first introduced into the aquarium, but it can be coaxed out a little more if it is given adequate space, areas of subdued lighting/plenty of dark hidey-holes, and peaceful tankmates that are not too boisterous at feeding times. Unless the tank is very spacious, it is best to keep just a single specimen, unless you can acquire a compatible pair. A dim moon light that is run during the evening hours will allow you to view your Marine Betta as it goes about its business under the preferred subdued illumination. Interestingly, this species is a Batesian mimic of the Guineafowl Moray Eel (Gymnothorax meleagris). When threatened, the Marine Betta holds all its unpaired fins erect and swims headfirst into a crevice. Rather than swimming right into the hole, it stops part way in, with the posterior part of its body exposed. The back end of the Marine Betta, with fins held erect, resembles the shape of a moray eel's head. The white spotted pattern and the prominent ocellus on the dorsal fin further add to the illusion that it is a spotted moray eel peering out from a rock, and by appearing to be something dangerous, the 'moray eel' is then given a wide berth by would-be predators. May also be seen on sale as the Comet.",

This small-sized butterflyfish is one of a complex of several similar looking fish and is only sporadically seen in the aquarium trade. This species is regarded as moderately difficult, and is therefore recommended for advanced aquarists only. A good-sized, mature system is requisite, along with ample live rock for the fish to browse upon/hide amongst and a large open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Water temperature should be lower than average on account of these fish hailing from deeper, slightly cooler waters (typically 20-80m/66-263ft). Medium sized specimens tend to acclimatise better to aquarium life, adapting much more quickly to various prepared foods, so try and choose a healthy, alert specimen around 7cm (2.8\") in length. Smaller sized fish may be reluctant to feed, and larger specimens can sometimes be rather finicky, requiring faultless water conditions. An aquarium that has some areas of lush filamentous algae growth will also aid your new fish in settling into its new surroundings; however, as with other butterflyfish species, these fish demand excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of brisk current. Some aquarists have successfully kept the Marquesas Butterflyfish alongside some of the more noxious soft corals, but this is something of a risk, and they should be observed carefully. Stony corals and many other sessile invertebrates will be constantly nipped at, so unfortunately must be avoided. Keep only one Marquesas Butterflyfish per tank (unless a mated pair is acquired) and not with any other butterflyfish as they will squabble over territories. Whilst they can be a little shy when first introduced, providing them with ample retreats amongst the live rock will ensure they quickly gain confidence and venture out into the open. Once settled, these intelligent, peaceful fish actually become very assertive feeders, competing with most other fish species, and they will also be most curious of any activity in and around their aquarium. Tankmates should be of similar size and temperament. As mentioned above, C. declivis forms part of a complex of similar-looking, deepwater fish known as the Tinker's Complex, which also includes C. burgessi, C. flavocoronatus, C. mitratus, and C. tinkeri. Where these species overlap in the wild, it is not uncommon for them to hybridise.

These graceful fish are protogynous hermaphrodites and form harems consisting of one male and several smaller females. Here they may be observed in their little groups, feeding on plankton in the water column. The angelfish from the genus Genicanthus are unusual in that they are not classed as true dwarf angels, yet they remain relatively small sized fish. They also display a remarkable sexual dimorphism. This particular species is ideal for the deepwater reef aquarium with lots of shady overhangs and crevices amongst the live rock. Although it does not grow to a huge size, the Masked Swallowtail Angelfish is a very active species that does require a good amount of space. Keep either singly, as a male-female pair, or one male with a harem of several females, but never house a male G. semifasciatus with another male or with any other members of the Genicanthus genus - especially those of similar appearance. Will usually ignore some of the more placid species of dwarf angelfish from the Centropyge genus, but as each fish is an individual and behaviour is certainly not set in stone, do observe very carefully. These fish have been known to pick on small planktivores such as wreckfish (Pseudanthias spp.), fairy and flasher wrasses, and fire fish, but they are perfectly safe with soft and stony corals. Good water movement is essential, and plenty of live rock will be appreciated for shelter/grazing (plenty of dimly lit areas will also help with the settling in period). Masked Swallowtail Angelfish generally adapt very well to life in captivity, accepting aquarium fare and acclimatising to the conditions found in a well-maintained tank. This species is recommended for intermediate to advanced aquarists only. They typically command a fairly high price because of the difficulty in collecting fish from deeper waters.

Here they form large aggregations as they feed on zooplankton in the water column. This is a very active, semi-aggressive acanthurid that requires a great deal of swimming space - adults have been known to grow to over a foot and a half long and are powerful fish. If you are blessed with a system of enormous proportions, the Mata Tang could make a wonderful centrepiece. The tank should contain plenty of live rock which this fish will enjoy grazing upon. Include plenty of hiding places that are large enough for the Mata Tang to retreat into quickly should it feel threatened, at the same time aiming for an aquascape that allows plenty of open swimming space along the front of the aquarium for such a powerful swimmer. Mata Tangs are moderately aggressive towards tankmates, and in the confines of the home aquarium, this includes their own kind; for this reason it is best to house just one specimen per tank. There are good reports of this fish mixing with tangs of other genera; however it is recommended that the Mata Tang is the last addition to a set up, as it can be rather territorial to newcomers, especially similar fish species. It is best to source a medium sized specimen (i.e. over 4\" in length) as they are more likely to acclimatise well to life in captivity. Conversely, extra large specimens may have a difficult time settling in, so aim for a healthy-looking fish that is neither too small nor excessively large. Avoid any specimens that appear \"pinched\" in the belly area, and do ask your retailer to show you that your chosen fish is feeding well prior to purchase. Mata Tangs have a high metabolism and require small frequent feeds throughout the day. Powerful filtration/vigorous circulation and a high level of oxygenation are therefore essential for this energetic, voracious eater. Be sure to keep on top of water quality as this fish will not tolerate deteriorating water conditions. A large refugium with living rock can be most useful: macroalgae can be cultured on this rock and these pieces rotated with pieces from the main tank, so that the Mata Tang has a continual supply of natural foodstuffs to graze upon. Take care when handling, as the caudal spines can inflict very painful wounds. A period of quarantine can be a valuable procedure for the acclimatisation of all livestock, and it is of particular importance for the Mata Tang which can be fairly susceptible to developing marine whitespot. This can be difficult to treat in the reef aquarium. Ideally the fish should be quarantined and carefully observed in a separate aquarium for at least a fortnight before being introduced into your main display tank. May also be seen on sale as the Blue Lined Tang or Elongate Tang.",
        "feeding": "Feed a varied diet for omnivores, with a large vegetable component, in small amounts 3 times per day.

This unusual triggerfish - with its extraordinarily lengthy and somewhat menacing-looking snout - is fairly uncommon and is rarely seen in the trade. It is part of the group of seven so-called 'Picasso triggerfish' of the Rhinecanthus genus, all with remarkably similar traits (with the exception of the favoured habitat of R. abyssus, which is known from much deeper waters compared to that of the other 6 species). This group of fish are primarily brown, grey, or white, and display strongly contrasting patterns in black, blue, orange, or yellow. All adult fish sport a dark line (in most species interspersed with blue) that extends from  the forehead down through the eye to the pectoral fin. As R. cinereus is seldomly seen in the hobby, it is likely to command a somewhat hefty price tag when it is imported. The Mauritius Triggerfish is an outgoing species that, over time, will learn to recognise its owner. Like many other members of this family, it is an aggressive fish that is best maintained in a large fish-only aquarium with tankmates of a similar size and disposition. As the fish matures, so its aggression level will heighten. In addition to a decent amount of swimming space, ample shelter should be provided for it to establish a territory of its own. Mauritius Triggerfish will attack all manner of invertebrate life, which renders it an unsuitable species for the reef aquarium. Care must be taken with the aquascaping as they do like to move aquarium decor around. They are also notorious for biting through tubing, and even heaters, so it is worth thinking carefully about where you place your equipment. Keep only one specimen per tank, and not with any other Triggerfish species, due to territorial nature. Smaller fish are likely to end up on the menu. Although triggerfish often become \"hand tame\" and beg for food whilst making grunting noises, it is not advisable to feed directly from your hands as the fingers could easily be mistaken for a meaty snack. Always keep a close eye on where the fish is when carrying out any maintenance in the tank. At night, this species may be observed sleeping in strange positions.

Juveniles are often seen in small groups, whereas adult fish are usually found in pairs.\n Compared to many other larger filefish, this species is rather less destructive, but much caution is advised if planning on adding to a reef setting; these fish will pick on most sessile invertebrates with the exception of potent stinging sea anemones such as Stichodactyla spp. (carpet anemones). Snails, shrimp, gorgonians, and sponges are particularly vulnerable. Therefore, this hardy species really is best housed in a tank containing live rock only. Saddled Filefish are generally quite passive and docile, especially when first introduced, and should only be kept with tankmates of a similar size and disposition.

        "care": "The Mimic Tang is a solitary species known from lagoons and seaward reefs, where it may be observed over areas of mixed coral, rock, and sand, or underneath ledges, feeding on various algae. Depending on location, juveniles of this species display one of three different colour patterns, mimicking different Centropyge species. For instance, in Guam, juvenile fish mimic the Lemon Peel Angelfish (C. flavissimus), but where the Lemon Peel Angelfish is absent in Palau, the juvenile fish instead mimic the Halfblack Angelfish (C. vrolikii). A further colour form replicates that of Herald's Angelfish (C. heraldi). This relationship is Batesian, in that the juvenile tang avoids predation because it resembles the less-palatable angelfish. Adult Mimic Tangs are a dark brown/purplish black colour with an orange patch emanating from the pectoral fin base. A dark band covers the gill opening and arcs down to the chin, with a narrow white band encircling the mouth. The caudal fin is lunate and edged with yellow. Due to an active nature and moderate adult size, the Mimic Tang requires a good sized aquarium with vigorous filtration and plenty of water movement and oxygenation. These fish are generally safe in the reef aquarium, providing they are well fed. A mature tank is necessary to help ensure that your Mimic Tang settles in well; in particular these fish enjoy grazing upon filamentous algae growing upon the decor. Arrange the live rock to create a sloping reef, with plenty of boltholes for the fish, should they feel the need to dash for cover at any time. Keep only one per tank, and not with any other Acanthurus species or direct food competitors, as these fish can be highly territorial. In very large aquaria, it is possible to maintain these fish alongside Tangs of other genera such as Ctenochaetus, Naso, and Zebrasoma - but ideally they should be of a similar size and added simultaneously. However, personalities do vary between individuals, so observe your fish very carefully to ensure that there are no problems. It is not advisable to house this fish with the Centropyge angelfish that it mimics, as the tang is likely to show much aggression towards the angelfish. May also be seen on sale as Chocolate Tang, Halfblack Mimic Tang, Lemon Peel Mimic Tang, or Yellow Mimic Tang. The pictured fish is a juvenile A. pyroferus mimicking the Lemon Peel Angelfish.",
        "feeding": "Feed a varied diet for omnivores, with a large vegetable component, in small amounts several times per day. Although this species will browse on algae within the aquarium, its diet must be supplemented with frozen herbivore rations, green marine flake, Spirulina (blue-green algae), Spirulina-enriched brineshrimp, cucumber, lettuce, broccoli, Nori (dried seaweed) etc. It will also take meaty frozen foods such as Mysis, but be sure that it is receiving enough green food to help prevent HLLE.

Not only does it often cope very poorly with the capture and shipping processes, but it also has special dietary requirements and can be challenging to get feeding. Even in those instances where it is possible to get the Moorish Idol to accept foods in captivity, there can be many problems in getting it to accept the correct foods to provide the necessary nutrition. An XXL mature tank is also absolutely essential, where plenty of unobstructed swimming space can be provided, as well as sufficient bolt holes amongst the established live rock where the fish can hide if startled. If this fish must be kept, its care requirements cannot be taken lightly. Ensure that the chosen specimen has been fully quarantined, is as healthy as possible, and is feeding well on the correct foodstuffs. However, even in the hands of very experienced aquarists, there are no guarantees that the fish may survive long term in the aquarium. Despite information available from some sources, it really is best to keep just one Moorish Idol per tank and not attempt a group situation as might be seen in nature - as inevitably there will be too much interspecific aggression within the confines of even the largest aquarium. The tank should contain plenty of live rock; however, be aware that corals and other sessile invertebrates will be picked at, eaten, and knocked over. Be sure that all structures are stable, as larger Moorish Idols can be quite destructive. Tankmates should be of a fairly peaceful nature and not too feisty at feeding times.",

        "care": "The Multibarred Angelfish is known from the caves, crevices, and ledges of steep outer reef slopes, and is also occasionally found in clear lagoon reefs. This secretive species is regularly observed in pairs or small groups and often rests upside down, close to a bolt-hole, rarely venturing far from the safety of cover. It is usually found in deeper water, at depths between 20-70m (66-230ft) and is only sporadically seen in the aquarium trade. Multibarred Angelfish are somewhat challenging to keep, so are only suitable for advanced aquarists who are able to set up and conscientiously maintain an aquarium based around this angelfish's specific needs. This is a species that will adapt much more readily to an aquarium with reduced illumination, and additionally, it absolutely must be provided with an abundance of shady hiding places amongst the living rock. It is also essential that this shy, delicate fish is placed into a spacious mature system without aggressive tankmates if it is to do well, and it should be the only angelfish species present in the tank. As Multibarred Angelfish are naturally gregarious, some prefer to maintain these fish as mated pairs, or, in XXL aquaria, in groups of 5+ (do ensure all individuals are of similar size and introduced simultaneously). Ideally, the tank will be both long and wide to allow for plenty of aquascaping with living rock, which, as mentioned above, will help to provide an abundance of dark shady crevices, ledges, and overhangs, and will also provide a decent base for the growth of coral cover. The more hiding places that are provided, the more you will actually see of these fish, as they will soon learn that they can retreat to safety when they feel the need. A larger tank should also ensure that the fish is much more unlikely to continually pick at any one particular sessile invertebrate and cause irreparable damage. However, be aware that sponges and LPS corals will be nipped at, so it is best to stick to soft corals only, and ensure that the fish are continually well-fed (without compromising on water quality). Powerful filtration is a must, as is decent water movement /high level of oxygenation. This is an attractive fish, which, just like the other two members of the same genus (P. boylei and P. venusta), possesses small, dainty pairs of trailing filaments on each of its dorsal fin spines, and longer filaments on each of the two ventral fins. Juvenile fish sport a large, distinct ocellus on the posterior portion of the dorsal fin. In the wild, P. multifasciata has been known to hybridise with P. venusta. May also be seen on sale as the Barred Angelfish or Manybanded Angelfish. ***Prior to purchase, please bear in mind that the Multibarred Angelfish is a very demanding species that requires an aquarium planned around its well-being; the angelfish should be made the centrepiece of the tank, with all the other variables worked around to suit its specific needs. Experienced aquarists only***",

However, these are no substitute for a long-established mature system with natural grazing opportunities on and amongst the living rock.

The aquarium should be as deep as possible and aquascaped with plenty of live rock, preferably stacked as to create plenty of narrow passageways and dark overhangs. A mature set up will ensure plenty of microalgae growth that the fish will enjoy browsing upon.

        "care": "The somewhat shy One-Spot Fox Face is a member of the venomous rabbitfish family, and is very similar in appearance to the standard Fox Face (S. vulpinus). In fact, some experts consider S. unimaculatus to be a geographical variant of S. vulpinus, the dark blotch on each flank being the defining feature. You may often see juveniles kept together in large shoals without problems in your local aquatics store, but be aware that as the fish mature, they become intolerant of their own kind within the confines of the aquarium and should be kept singly, with the exception of a bonded male-female pair. Unrelated fish species will be ignored, most giving the One-Spot Fox face a wide berth because of the venomous spines on their dorsal and anal fins. Needless to say, this is a fish that must be handled with much care when catching and acclimatising; ideally it should be gently herded into a submerged fish-bag or solid container, rather than risk using a net to lift it from the water. The fish is likely to erect its fins, entangling the sturdy spines in the netting, and at the same time there is the chance of the aquarist receiving a very painful sting. The tank itself should offer plenty of dark hiding places amongst rockwork, and employ decent filtration and circulation. If adding this species to a reef aquarium, be aware that occasional specimens do have a taste for coral polyps, particularly those that are hungry, so be sure to observe carefully and ensure the fish is receiving enough food. The One-Spot Fox Face has a small mouth that is specially adapted for browsing on algae (the main constituent of its diet). They must receive regular offerings of greenfoods in their diet, otherwise their colours will fade and their health may suffer. Meaty foods can be offered, and indeed will be accepted, but it is very important that rabbitfish receive a decent amount of algae-based foodstuffs as part of their daily nourishment. This species is capable of changing colour to a blotchy \"fright pattern\" at the blink of an eye. This can be due to a sudden shock (e.g. someone coming into the room where the aquarium is situated), an altercation with another fish, lights coming on too suddenly etc. Ideally the tank should be situated away from areas of high foot traffic.

        "care": "The Orange Face Tang is known from clear, seaward reef slopes to depths of 50m (164ft). Juvenile fish tend to inhabit shallow protected reef environments, whereas the adults (who are usually found singly or in pairs) favour deep coastal reef slopes and outer reef walls where they can be observed feeding on various types of algae growing on the rocks. This species is rarely encountered in the trade, but if the aquarist is blessed with an enormous system, this fish is well worth looking out for as it would make a wonderful centrepiece. The tank should be mature and contain plenty of live rock which the Orange Face Tang will enjoy grazing upon. Include plenty of hiding places that are large enough for your fish to retreat into quickly should it feel threatened, at the same time aiming for an aquascape that allows plenty of open swimming space along the front of the aquarium for such a powerful swimmer. Orange Face Tangs are not overly aggressive towards tankmates, however they will show hostility towards their own kind and towards other members of the Acanthurus genus - for this reason it is best to house just one specimen per tank. There are good reports of this fish mixing with tangs of other genera; however it is recommended that the Orange Face Tang is the last addition to a set up, as it can be a little territorial to newcomers, especially similar fish species. It is best to source a medium sized specimen (i.e. over 4\" in length) as they are more likely to acclimatise well to life in captivity. Conversely, extra large specimens may have a difficult time settling in, so aim for a healthy-looking fish that is neither too small nor excessively large. Avoid any specimens that appear \"pinched\" in the belly area, and do ask your retailer to show you that your chosen fish is feeding well prior to purchase. Orange Face Tangs have a high metabolism and require small frequent feeds throughout the day. Powerful filtration/circulation and a high level of oxygenation are therefore essential for this energetic, voracious eater. Be sure to keep on top of water quality as this fish will not tolerate deteriorating water conditions. A large refugium with living rock can be most useful: macroalgae can be cultured on this rock and these pieces rotated with pieces from the main tank, so that the Orange Face Tang has a continual supply of natural foodstuffs to graze upon. Take care when handling this species, as the caudal spines are large and can inflict a very painful wound. A period of quarantine can be a valuable procedure for the acclimatisation of all livestock, and it is of particular importance for the Orange Face Tang which can be fairly susceptible to developing marine white spot. This can be difficult to treat in the reef aquarium. Ideally the fish should be quarantined and carefully observed in a separate aquarium for at least a fortnight before being introduced into your main display tank. The pictured fish is a 5\" juvenile. As these fish mature, their appearance changes, with the fish developing dazzling golden-orange and bright blue markings to the fins against deeper blues, browns, and black, with a maze of orange freckles on the face. The tail takes on a lunate shape and is covered in many fine black spots, hence the other common name of Black Spot Tang.",
        "feeding": "Feed a varied diet for omnivores, with a large vegetable component, in small amounts several times per day.

        "care": "The Orange Shoulder Tang is known from seaward reefs over areas of bare rock, mixed rubble, and sand, to a depth of 46m (151ft). Juvenile fish, which have an all-over bright yellow body colouration with just the slightest hint of blue edging the anal and dorsal fins, inhabit the safer waters of protected bays and lagoons. Adults are a two tone grey colour with a bright orange flash ringed in blue across the 'shoulders', just above the pectoral fins. The caudal fin will take on a beautiful lyre shape as the fish mature. Orange Shoulder Tangs occur singly or in shoals, feeding on diatoms, fine filamentous algae, biofilms, and detritus covering the sand and bare rock. This is a large, active species that requires an XXL aquarium with a good deal of swimming space. Although this fish can attain quite a size, it is not as belligerent as some members of the genus, and will typically ignore tankmates, including other tangs that are of similar disposition. It is usually best to keep only one Orange Shoulder Tang per tank, unless the system is vast and there are an abundance of visual barriers. If conditions are suitable for housing more than one, it is always best to add a juvenile to the aquarium that contains an adult, and not the other way around.  If placing with other tangs (except A. nigricans and A. triostegus, which are less aggressive) add this species first. Generally speaking, this fish is safe in reef aquaria (provided that it is well fed), but do observe carefully. It will actively browse on filamentous algae growing on the d\u00c3\u00a9cor, so a mature tank is essential. Arrange the live rock to create a sloping reef, with plenty of boltholes for the fish (should they feel the need to dash for cover at any time), also being sure to leave a large open swimming area and a wide expanse of sand for grazing. Vigorous filtration and circulation is a must for this energetic, voracious eater. Take care when handling, as the caudal spines can inflict a painful wound.

        "care": "In the wild, Orange Spot Gobies inhabit sandy areas of lagoons and seaward reefs. They usually occur in pairs and excavate a shallow burrow from bits of rubble as a safe refuge. A large mature reef aquarium with a deep sand bed and a well-established refugium are essential for this species, which is recommended for advanced aquarists only. Orange Spot Gobies like to dig burrows underneath rocks and coral bases, so be sure that any structures are secure, and that there is a good depth of (live) sand in most parts of the aquarium. This will not only enable them to create a burrow, but is also a vital lifeline for them as they sift through this substrate in search for tiny invertebrate food items. The sand is taken in through the mouth, the food items swallowed, and the remaining sand expelled through the gills. These fish are not overly particular where they dump the sand they have sifted, and as it is usually expelled whilst the fish are in motion, it can sometimes end up dropping down onto and swamping prized corals. For this reason, they are not always a welcome addition to aquaria containing delicate coral life, and careful planning is needed. However, if their requirements can be met, it must be said that these fish do a remarkably good job of overturning the substrate and keeping it looking fresh. Wherever possible, this is a species that should be maintained in a compatible pair. Orange Spot Gobies should not be kept alongside other members of the Valenciennea genus as they will quarrel. This species occurs over quite a range, and regional colour variations are known. Capable of jumping from open topped aquaria.",
        "feeding": "This species gains the vast majority of its food through sifting the contents of large established sand beds for invertebrate life.

Juvenile fish may be observed in large aggregations in shallow estuaries, whereas the adults are typically seen in pairs in the deeper areas of the reef, feeding on benthic algae. The \"Spinefoot\" common name was originally coined by unfortunate beachcombers who accidentally trod on one and felt the full force of the venomous spines.\nThe aquarium should have powerful filtration and circulation, and should offer plenty of dark hiding places amongst the rockwork. If adding this species to a reef aquarium, be aware that occasional specimens do have a taste for certain coral polyps, particularly those that are feeling hungry, so be sure to observe carefully and ensure the fish is receiving enough food. This fish has a small mouth that is specially adapted for browsing on algae (the main constituent of its diet) and will consume both undesirable and desirable algae species. They must receive regular offerings of greenfoods in their diet, otherwise they will fade in colour and their health will deteriorate. Meaty foods can be offered, and indeed will be accepted, but it is very important that rabbitfish receive a decent amount of algae-based foodstuffs as part of their daily nourishment.  Needless to say, this is a fish that must be handled with much care when catching and acclimatising; ideally it should be gently herded into a submerged fish-bag or solid container, rather than risk using a net to lift it from the water. The fish is likely to erect its fins, entangling the sturdy spines in the netting, and at the same time there is the chance of the aquarist receiving a very painful sting. This species is capable of changing colour to a blotchy \"fright pattern\" at the blink of an eye. This can be due to a sudden shock (e.g. someone coming into the room where the aquarium is situated), an altercation with another fish, lights coming on too suddenly etc. Ideally the tank should be situated away from high areas of foot traffic. These fish also adopt the same blotchy pattern when resting at night. The colour and pattern of juvenile fish differs markedly to that of adult fish; indeed, young fish display a deep brown patch that straddles the lateral line, which becomes obscured as the fish increase in size and age. S. punctatus  is sometimes confused with S. guttatus, particularly in older literature. However, they may be told apart by the presence of a bright yellow blotch directly in front of the caudal peduncle in S. guttatus, absent in S. punctatus.

Despite initial shyness and small size, this dazzling purple species is actually best suited to a moderately aggressive community of medium-sized fish that can look after themselves. Definitely avoid housing with any small, timid fish or hesitant feeders. The aquarium must be mature and should include ample rockwork, arranged so that there is an abundance of small caves, crevices, channels, and overhangs that provide safe, shady retreats for this species. If the aquarium is very spacious, and has plenty of visual barriers amongst the decor, more than one specimen may be kept together if of the same size and introduced simultaneously - however do observe very carefully and separate if necessary. Do not keep with other members of the same genus or close relatives. Will prey on small ornamental shrimps, fanworms, and bristleworms, and will pester small/docile fish (e.g. Anthias, fairy wrasses, firefish, small gobies etc). Species that are not easily bullied e.g. larger angelfish, tangs, hawkfish, and large damselfish, for example, tend to make the best tankmates. The Orchid Dottyback should be the last fish added to the aquarium, otherwise it will show aggression towards any newcomers introduced into what it perceives as its established domain. It will be particularly defensive of its preferred hidey-hole, and even more so when breeding. It is essential that the tank has tight fitting coverslides, as these fish are expert jumpers.

        "breeding": "This species has been bred in captivity, and tank-raised specimens are frequently available in the trade. The male entices the female into spawning by performing an elaborate mating dance outside his chosen cave or piece of PVC pipe. If the female accepts the male, she will enter the cave/pipe and deposit several hundred eggs, which are simultaneously fertilised by the male. The male then drives the female away and takes on paternal care of the adhesive eggs, gently fanning them with his pectoral fins and even picking them up and moving them to a new location if he feels they are in danger. The eggs should hatch within 3-5 days (temperature dependent) and they remain in a larval state for around 25-30 days. As soon as the eggs hatch, parental care ceases, so you will need to separate the young from the parents and any other fish in the tank just prior to this event. Raising the larvae to adult fish is possible, but very challenging - you will need a ready supply of miniscule foodstuffs such as rotifers available at all times and water quality/tank hygiene must be continually monitored. The female fish can come off a bit the worse for wear following a spawning event (ripped fins, missing scales etc) so be sure to keep a close eye on water quality to ensure she recovers quickly."

Pacific Crowned Pufferfish feed on a wide variety of benthic organisms (including bivalves, brittle stars, bryozoans, crabs, foraminiferans, gastropods, heart urchins, polychaetes, sea urchins, sponges, and tunicates) and as such, are not suitable for reef aquaria.

This diurnal grazer feeds on a range of sessile invertebrates, algae, and plankton, but to a larger extent,  specialises in feeding on sponges. Juveniles of the species exhibit cleaning behaviour with a variety of fish, and adults have been seen cleaning sharks and manta rays. The adults are also often observed forming large shoals with the Cortez Angelfish (Pomacanthus zonipectus) to depths of 30m (98ft). Although the Passer Angelfish feeds predominantly on sponges in the wild, unlike some other members of the genus, they will usually switch to consuming other fare in the home aquarium quite successfully. However, it is still prudent to try and find an ongoing source of frozen sponge-based Angelfish rations for the best long term care. Passer Angelfish will always fare best in spacious, mature aquaria with an abundance of live rock and an open swimming space along the front of the tank. Established systems will provide much more in the way of nutritious micro-invertebrates in the living rock and this will help to supplement the specialised diet. In smaller systems, such critters will be quickly depleted, which is why it is doubly important that this active fish is given ample space. Passer Angelfish demand excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of decent current. Keep only one per tank, and not with any other angelfish. This is a very boisterous species that does best with other semi-aggressive tankmates, and it should be the last fish added to an aquarium. Juvenile specimens are largely dusky orange with one white and several blue stripes (as pictured here). With age the colour pattern morphs into a predominately dark blue background colour with a white vertical stripe extending down from the dorsal fin, stretching approximately 2/3 of the way down to the pelvic fins. The caudal fin and the pectoral fins are yellow, whilst the dorsal and anal fins are tinged with orange. There is some debate amongst ichthyologists as to whether this species displays sexual dichromatism; some believe that the male fish have yellow pelvic fins and the female white, yet others insist it is the females that have yellow pelvic fins, and the males white. Another school of thought suggests this difference is merely down to geographical variation and is not an indicator of sex. May also be seen on sale as the King Angelfish.",

        "care": "The Peacock Wrasse is one of 11 currently known species of Macropharyngodon, and although all are incredibly beautiful, this genera is considered very delicate and does have some specialist care requirements that must be fulfilled by the advanced aquarist if these fish are to acclimatise well to life in captivity. In the wild, the Peacock Wrasse is found over mixed sand, rubble, and coral areas of lagoons and sheltered seaward reefs to depths of 30m (98ft), where it occurs singly, in pairs, or in large aggregations of females, and is usually observed browsing for molluscs and foraminiferans amongst the substratum. This leopard wrasse requires a very mature, spacious aquarium with plenty of live rock and sand that supports its natural diet on an ongoing basis, if it is to thrive. If added to a newly set up tank, it will starve to death. There should be plenty of hiding places amongst the rockwork, with enough depth of substrate (7.5cm/3\" of fine sand) for the fish to bury if it feels threatened. Because of the difficulties in feeding this leopard wrasse, it should not be kept with fish that require a similar food source to survive, as otherwise one species may out-compete the other. There should be relatively calm areas in the tank that allow it to locate food successfully. Tankmates should be peaceful and of an easygoing nature so that the Peacock Wrasse does not feel harassed and subsequently stops venturing out to feed. Groups can sometimes be kept together successfully (added simultaneously) but larger numbers should only ever be considered for exceptionally large aquaria, as in the average sized aquarium, natural prey will deplete too quickly with that many fish requiring the same diet. Do not house with other Macropharyngodon species or pugnacious dottybacks and hawkfish, as they will fight for territory. When choosing your leopard wrasse, check that its body is not emaciated, and that it is actively searching for food. It is not uncommon for a newly added leopard wrasse to hide beneath the substrate whilst it adjusts to its new surroundings and altered circadian rhythm; in such cases it is best to leave them be, they will usually begin to explore within a couple of days. These fish require stable and optimal water conditions at all times, so a good filtration and maintenance regime is a must. Ensure that the aquarium has tight fitting coverslides with no small gaps in the hood, as these fish are expert jumpers. May also be seen on sale as Blue Star Leopard Wrasse, Divided Leopard Wrasse, Rare Wrasse, Peacock Leopard Wrasse, Splendid Leopard Wrasse, or Vermiculate Leopard Wrasse. Not recommended for beginners.",
        "feeding": "Very challenging to feed. This species will spend many hours searching out micro-invertebrates living in amongst the live rock and substrate.

These fish are often observed in pairs, feeding on small benthic invertebrates and algae, around areas colonized with staghorn corals. This is a moderately hardy species that usually acclimatizes well to aquarium life if kept in peaceful surroundings. However, it is not regarded as completely reef-safe on account of its fondness for feeding on many soft corals and other small invertebrates. Some aquarists have successfully maintained the PearlscaleButterflyfish in reef aquaria; keeping the fish very well fed, and housing alongside only some of the more noxious soft corals that aren't so palatable are seen as key - but caution and careful observation is still advised. This fish does best in mature aquaria containing plenty of live rock for the fish to browse on and forage amongst. As with all butterflyfishes, this species demands excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well-oxygenated, with areas of decent current. Tankmates should be of a peaceable nature, as these fish are relatively shy and shouldn't be kept with more belligerent fish or they may refuse to venture out and feed. More than one specimen may be housed together providing that the aquarium is very spacious and all are introduced simultaneously asjuveniles. Do not mix with other butterflyfish species particularly close relatives, as this species will show aggression towards them. Chaetodon xanthurus is replaced by the Redback Butterflyfish (C. paucifasciatus)in the Red Sea, and by Merten's Butterflyfish (C. mertensii) in the South Pacific.

This fish is an all-time favourite amongst many marine aquarists on account of its captivating personality and vibrant colouration. In the wild, clownfish are afforded lifelong protection from predators and skin parasites by a host anemone; Percula Clownfish being most commonly associated with the Giant Carpet Anemone (Stichodactyla gigantea), the Ritteri anemone (Heteractis magnifica), and the Sebae Anemone (H. crispa). In the community reef aquarium, a host anemone - some of which can be a little tricky to maintain successfully in captivity - is not necessary for your clownfish as most reef set ups contain plenty of hiding places, no large predatory fish, and sometimes cleaner shrimp/cleaner wrasse. In the absence of an anemone, some clownfish take up residence in what they see as a suitable coral substitute - which may cause them to retract in irritation as the clownfish wallow - but this isn\"\u2122t always the case. Many species of clownfish (including the Percula) are now captive-raised, so wherever possible the conscientious aquarist should aim to source these hardier specimens for the home aquarium, in turn helping to take pressure off the reefs. As these fish can be quite territorial, in the average sized aquarium you should aim to keep just one known pair. In XXL aquaria, more than one pair could be kept if they are all added at the same time as juvenile specimens and plenty of visual barriers are provided amongst the d\u00c3\u00a9cor (or in the case of adding host anemones, enough anemones for all the fish, added at the same time as the clowns). If shelters are limited, the dominant clownfish will bully the others, picking them off one-by-one, so careful observation is necessary. Bear in mind that catching fish out of an established reef tank can be extremely difficult, so think carefully about adding more than one pair to your set up! It is also best not to mix this species with other species of clownfish as many will fight. With regards to sexing, all clownfish are born as males. A wild colony may consist of a breeding pair, which cohabit with a few non-reproductive smaller male specimens. When the female dies, the dominant male will change sex and become the female. This is known as protandrous sequential hermaphroditism. In the case of two juvenile specimens in the home aquarium, the larger of the two will become the female. Finally, do not attempt to house Percula Clownfish with the Atlantic Carpet anemone (Condylactis sp.) as they may be consumed, and be aware that these fish are very sensitive to treatment with copper remedies. May also be seen on sale as the Orange Clownfish or the True Percula Clownfish.",

Numerous eggs (numbering between several hundred to a few thousand) will be deposited and the male will aerate them by fanning them with his pectoral fins whilst the female guards them against predators. The eggs will hatch in darkness after 7-10 days, and once free-swimming, the planktonic fry are left to fend for themselves and should be fed on suitably tiny foodstuffs such as live rotifers, moving on to baby brineshrimp after a few days.

Whilst the shrimp is working, it maintains antenna contact with its goby partner posted at the entrance of the shared burrow. If the shrimp detects the quivering motion of the goby's caudal fin during an unusual situation, it reacts by immediately withdrawing into the depths of the burrow. The entrance to the shared burrow will be closed at night, and only one entrance is usually open at any one time.The shrimp will only emerge from the burrow whilst it can have tactile contact with the goby. Provided with a reasonable depth of coral sand and a good selection of loose coral rubble pieces that vary in size (not too big to be moved) these gobies can do very well in the home aquarium. The goby will survive without its shrimp partner, but if they can be acquired together, they will make such a fascinating display, captivating the observer for hours on end. Your dealer may be able to acquire the two together, it is certainly worth asking. The Pinkspot Goby is a territorial species, and larger specimens will think nothing of attacking other gobies and even smaller, unrelated species such as wrasses and assessors. However, it is much less likely to be antagonistic if housed in spacious aquaria with plenty of visual barriers (although do remember to include large, open expanses of substrate), and where it is one of the last fishes added to the tank. Hostility normally initially takes the form of jaw gaping, fin flaring, and sideways shoving, but if it is allowed to escalate, real damage may ensue if the goby takes a bite at its adversary, so do observe very carefully. It is best to keep only one specimen per tank unless you can acquire a mated male-female pair, as conspecifics will fight. These gobies are considered reef safe as they will not harm sessile invertebrates, but be aware that they will predate on small, ornamental shrimps and small bristleworms.

The Pinktail Trigger has a subtle beauty and is one of the few triggerfish species that can be safely kept in most reef aquaria.

        "care": "The Porcupine Pufferfish is known from a wide range of habitats including rich, shallow reefs and open areas with rocky or soft, muddy substrates, to depths of 35m (115ft). Juveniles have been observed amongst floating Sargassum rafts, sub-adults are gregarious and form small groups, whereas adults are solitary. These relatively poor swimmers are nocturnal by nature and feed on crabs, hermit crabs, molluscs, and sea urchins. Young fish display a spotty pattern (particularly prominent on the belly), whereas adults sport dark blotches across the back and spots in between the blotches, the spots becoming fewer with age. This is a popular species for the Fish-Only marine aquarium on account of the fish's rather comical and amiable personality; indeed, many keepers report how these intelligent fish quickly learn to recognise their owners, likening them to \"pet dogs\", such are their characters and responses to visual stimuli. As Porcupine Pufferfish tend to attain quite a size, a very large tank will be needed to house an adult specimen. Despite its eventual size, this species is relatively gentle for a puffer, although it must still be considered a semi-aggressive fish. Porcupine Pufferfish can be kept in pairs or groups in a vast tank if all fish are of the same size and they are added to the aquarium simultaneously. Tankmates must be of similar size and temperament e.g. large angelfish, large tangs, triggerfish etc. The aquarium should be aquascaped with plenty of rockwork, with some large sized shelters, and an open swimming space along the front. Filtration must be efficient to cope with the voracious eating habits and large amounts of waste that these fish produce, yet water movement should not be too vigorous. Be aware that large pufferfish are notorious for biting through tubing, and even heaters, so it is worth thinking very carefully about where you place your equipment; do also always keep a close eye on where the fish is when carrying out any maintenance in the tank. When frightened, these fish can inflate themselves, causing the long spines to stand erect, which deters predators. This defence mechanism is a last resort, and should never be actively encouraged; it is particularly dangerous if the fish ingests air instead of water. Kept in the right conditions, the Porcupine Pufferfish will become a real \"\u02dcpet fish\"\u2122 with bags of personality, soon learning to recognise its owner and beg for food. Just don't be tempted to feed directly from your hand \"\u201c always add food a safe distance away, or with tongs! May also be seen on sale as the Balloon Porcupinefish, Freckled Porcupinefish, Longspined Porcupinefish, Porcupine Fish, or Spiny Pufferfish.",
        "feeding": "Offer a varied diet consisting mainly of meaty items such as vitamin-enriched krill, prawns, cockle, mussel, whitebait, squid, and clam meat. Hard shelled foods such as cockle-in-shell and crab legs should be given regularly to help keep the beak worn down. A decent amount of living rock in the tank will also give the puffer lots of browsing opportunities which will also help to keep the beak in check. Some herbivorous rations can be given now and again, but avoid any floating foods as the fish may ingest air which can lead to buoyancy problems. Feed small amounts 3 times per day. Please note that this species will constantly \"beg\" for food in a puppy-like manner, and this does not always mean the fish is genuinely hungry - it is just that they very quickly learn to recognise the aquarist and associate their presence with food, so don't be tricked into overfeeding.",

        "care": "Potter\"\u2122s Leopard Wrasse is one of 11 currently known species of Macropharyngodon, and although all are incredibly beautiful, this genera is considered very delicate and does have some specialist care requirements that must be fulfilled by the advanced aquarist if these fish are to acclimatise well to life in captivity. In the wild, Potter\"\u2122s Leopard Wrasse is found over mixed sand, rubble, and coral areas of seaward reefs, where it constantly browses for molluscs and foraminiferans. It is a Batesian mimic of the more robust Potter\"\u2122s Angelfish (Centropyge potteri), which affords it better protection from predators. This leopard wrasse requires a very mature, spacious aquarium with plenty of live rock and sand that supports its natural diet on an ongoing basis, if it is to thrive. If added to a newly set up tank, it will starve to death. There should be plenty of hiding places amongst the rockwork, with enough depth of substrate (7.5cm/3\"\u009d of fine sand) for the fish to bury if it feels threatened. Because of the difficulties in feeding this leopard wrasse, it should not be kept with fish that require a similar food source to survive, as otherwise one species may out-compete the other. There should be relatively calm areas in the tank that allow it to locate food successfully. Tankmates should be peaceful and of an easygoing nature so that the Potter\"\u2122s Leopard Wrasse does not feel harassed and subsequently stops venturing out to feed. Groups can sometimes be kept together successfully (added simultaneously) but larger numbers should only ever be considered for exceptionally large aquaria, as in the average sized aquarium, natural prey will deplete too quickly with that many fish requiring the same diet. Do not house with other Macropharyngodon species or pugnacious dottybacks and hawkfish, as they will fight for territory. When choosing your leopard wrasse, check that its body is not emaciated, and that it is actively searching for food. It is not uncommon for a newly added leopard wrasse to hide beneath the substrate whilst it adjusts to its new surroundings and altered circadian rhythm; in such cases it is best to leave them be, they will usually begin to explore within a couple of days. These fish require stable and optimal water conditions at all times, so a good filtration and maintenance regime is a must. Ensure that the aquarium has tight fitting coverslides with no small gaps in the hood, as these fish are expert jumpers. Not recommended for beginners.",

They have also been observed at the outer reef drop off zones where currents are particularly vigorous. Usually found in pairs, Purple Firefish will hover together, feeding on zooplankton in the water column. This species is an ideal candidate for the reef aquarium; it is hardy, colourful, relatively peaceful, and readily acclimatises to aquarium life. The tank should be mature and aquascaped with plenty of live rock so that there are numerous nooks and crannies for your firefish to dart into if startled. There should be areas of brisk water movement and a high level of oxygenation these fish can often be seen hovering in the water column, facing the strong current whilst waiting for microscopic food morsels to drift past. They will never stray too far from cover though. The Purple Firefish is considered one of the more pugnacious of the firefishes, and although it will rarely become aggressive towards other fish species (except close relatives), it is very territorial, and will fight with its own kind unless they are a mated pair. For this reason it is best to either keep a single specimen (particularly in smaller, \"nano\" aquaria) or acquire a known mated pair. These fish cannot be sexed externally and simply putting two specimens together and hoping for the best is unlikely to work. Tankmates should be of a peaceful nature in order that the firefish do not feel intimidated at feeding times. Observe very carefully, as firefish are easily bullied. Do ensure that the tank has tightly fitting coverslides and no escape holes, as these fish are expert jumpers.

This beautiful angelfish is rarely seen in the trade, and as such, tends to command a hefty price tag when it is available.

Also, ensuring that the fish is well-fed means that it should not pose any real threat to reef aquaria - although occasional specimens may nip at some invertebrate life (see below) it should be noted that this only usually occurs if dietary requirements and feeding frequency are not being met. Careful observation is recommended. The Purple Masked Angelfish should be kept singly and not with any other members of the Centropyge genus.

        "care": "The Pyramid Butterflyfish is known from steep, current-swept outer reef slopes to depths of 60m (197ft). This species is often observed congregating in sizeable shoals that may extend several metres above the reef, as the fish feed on the abundance of zooplankton that the currents deliver. Hemitaurichthys is an often overlooked genus, containing 4 known species. It is a shame that they are not seen more often in the trade, as these are relatively hardy fish that acclimatise well to aquarium life, and if well fed, they usually pose no problems in reef aquaria that house some of the more noxious soft corals. A number of aquarists have even found them to be completely reef-safe, but as with such matters, \"your mileage may vary\", and we would recommend exercising caution and careful observation. Pyramid Butterflyfish grow reasonably large and are an active species, so a spacious aquarium that allows room for both ample live rock and a decent swimming space along the front of the tank is requisite. Ideally this peaceful species will be maintained in small groups, as it prefers to live in aggregations - intraspecific aggression should not be an issue here. It is best to try and obtain medium sized specimens of between 7.5 and 12.5cm in length, as these always adapt to aquarium life much more readily than those which are very small or very large. If planning on adding a group (and this is best for their long term wellbeing), try to obtain specimens that are all of roughly equal size, and add all to the tank simultaneously. They should be the only butterflyfish species in the aquarium, and if at all possible, tankmates should be of similar size and temperament. Any fish which could be considered as mildly aggressive should be added after the Pyramid Butterflyfish have established their territories, and only if the tank offers sufficient space and ample visual barriers amongst the rockwork. Never try to house these fish with boisterous feeders as they are likely to intimidate the butterflies at feeding time. Ensure that the water is thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, and provide areas of brisk current. As with all butterflyfishes, they are always going to be much less likely to pick on corals and other invertebrates if they are well fed and given plenty of space and distractions. May also be seen on sale as Yellow Pyramid Butterflyfish. The intensity of the brown-black area on the head can vary depending on mood, time of day etc. It is replaced by the black/brown and white Zoster Butterflyfish (H. zoster) in the Indian Ocean.",

        "care": "The Queen Angelfish is a reef dweller known from Florida, USA and the Gulf of Mexico, through the Caribbean, down to Brazil, and over to St Paul's Rocks in the eastern central Atlantic. This diurnal grazer feeds almost exclusively on sponges, supplemented with small amounts of algae, bryozoans, hydroids, and tunicates. Juveniles of the species exhibit cleaning behaviour with a variety of fish, removing ectoparasites from their skin. Adults tend to occur solitary or in pairs, favouring areas rich with corals, seafans, and seawhips, to depths of 70m (230ft). Although the Queen Angelfish feeds predominantly on sponges in the wild, unlike some other members of the genus, they will usually switch to consuming other fare in the home aquarium quite successfully. However, it is still prudent to try and find an ongoing source of frozen sponge-based Angelfish rations for the best long term care. Queen Angelfish will always fare best in spacious, mature aquaria with an abundance of live rock and an open swimming space along the front of the tank. Established systems will provide much more in the way of nutritious micro-invertebrates in the living rock and this will help to supplement the specialised diet. In smaller systems, such critters will be quickly depleted, which is why it is doubly important that this active fish is given ample space. Queen Angelfish demand excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of decent current. Keep only one per tank, and not with any other angelfish. This is a very boisterous species that does best with other semi-aggressive tankmates, and it should be the last fish added to an aquarium. Juvenile specimens are predominantly dark blue with bright yellow chest, pectoral fins, pelvic fins, and tail. The edges of the dorsal and anal fins are royal blue, and there are several light blue, gently curved vertical lines on the flanks. A dark blue mask, edged in royal blue, runs down through the eyes. With age the colour pattern changes: the blue on the flanks becomes brighter and the scales are edged with bright yellow (sometimes giving an overall green appearance when viewed from a distance). The pectoral, pelvic, and caudal fins remain bright yellow, with a large blue spot forming at the base of the pectoral fins. The area on top of the head develops a large black spot that is peppered with electric blue specks and surrounded by an electric blue ring. A series of short blue spines grow down the gill covers, above the main opercular spine on each side. This fish is very similar in appearance to the Blue Angelfish (H. bermudensis) and hybrids of these two species do sometimes occur where their ranges overlap.",

        "care": "The Raccoon Butterflyfish is a robust, largely nocturnal species known from shallow reef flats, lagoons, and seaward reefs, up to a depth of around 30m (98ft). Juvenile fish tend to favour rocky inner reef flats or tide pools, but adults have often been observed swimming more out in the open, in pairs or small groups, and feeding on various invertebrates, coral polyps, and algae. In the home aquarium, Raccoon Butterflyfish should be offered plenty of swimming space and a multitude of hiding places. These fish are best kept singly, although if you are blessed with an XXL system, they can be kept in large groups - consisting of same-size fish added simultaneously, to help avoid aggression. Such groups may bicker from time to time, but as long as they are provided with plenty of visual barriers amongst the decor, no real harm should ensue. However, be aware that such groups will not work in smaller quarters. These fish should not be housed with any other butterflyfish species as they will show much hostility towards each other; however, they are usually safe with non-related fish species that can look after themselves (avoid any small, docile species). As mentioned previously, the tanks should contain an abundance of rockwork for the fish to hide amongst, but leave a large open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. As with all butterflies, this species demands excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well-oxygenated, with areas of decent current. Although tending to be of a fairly nocturnal nature in the wild, these fish adapt well to aquarium lighting and feeding schedules and often become very active during the day. Interestingly, the Raccoon Butterflyfish has the ability to change appearance to a dark blotchy form when wanting to blend into its surroundings at night, or when threatened. Juveniles sport a prominent false eye spot towards the top anterior part of the body, which tends to blend in more with the fishs markings as it matures. This species is very similar in appearance to the RedSea Raccoon Butterflyfish (C. fasciatus).",
        "feeding": "Offer a wide variety of foods, fed in small amounts several times per day. Frozen foods such as Mysis shrimp,vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, Angel & Butterfly mix, finely chopped clam/mussel/cockle/crab/shrimp/squid etc should be given. Ensure the larger foodstuffs are chopped into small enough pieces on account of butterflyfish having tiny mouths.",
        "breeding": "This species has not been bred in captivity. In the wild, these fish form distinct pairs and scatter their eggs in open water where they are dispersed by the currents. The eggs are small(<1 mm), and the embryos hatch approximately 30 hours after fertilization. The larvae subsequently spend about 40 days in the plankton before settling the reef."

        "care": "Randall's Anthias is known from current-swept rubbly caves along steep drop-offs and channel walls, at depths between 15-70m (49-230ft). These beautiful fish gather in small aggregations amongst crevices, feeding on zooplankton in the water column, but always staying close to cover. Male fish are characteristically territorial and form a harem with a large number of females. This is a great species for the reef tank, and moderately easy to maintain. In the confines of the aquarium, it is best to keep either a solitary specimen, or else a group comprising of a single male and at least 8 females. Unfortunately, smaller groups will result in squabbles, where the weakest fish is likely to be picked on and prevented from feeding, eventually succumbing to being bullied by the others. These large shoals should only be considered if the tank is of XXL proportions \"\u201c if the tank is of average size, it really is best to house a single specimen only. Adults can be kept with moderately pugnacious tankmates such as pygmy angelfish and medium sized tangs etc, as long as the Randall's Anthias are introduced and established first. However, be sure to avoid any large, aggressive species that would prevent the Randall's Anthias from venturing out to feed. These fish are usually perfectly safe in a reef set up, typically ignoring sessile invertebrates. Provide plenty of shady crevices and overhangs amongst the live rock so that these deeper water fish feel secure. Over time, they can become accustomed to brighter lighting, but they should be exposed to more intense illumination very gradually - this is why, when initially introduced, it is so important to provide plenty of refuges from the illumination of the average well-lit reef aquarium. A varied diet is a must to keep the fish in good health and for them to display their vibrant colouration. Ideally they will be fed small amounts several times per day (see below). Powerful filtration and protein skimming, plus a good maintenance regime are essential for maintaining optimal water quality despite the heavy nutrient input. As these fish inhabit areas of great tidal surge in the wild, they require vigorous water movement in the home aquarium - a high level of oxygenation at all times being of utmost importance. Randall\"'s Anthias goes through one of the most remarkable colour changes of any Anthias species during the transition from female to male. Females are an overall peach colour on the flanks, which merges into yellow on the tail, around the eye, and on the snout. The dorsal, ventral, and anal fins usually have a very thin blue-purple margin to them. The fins will appear rounded and without filaments, with the exception of the third dorsal ray which may be extended in very mature females or in those females which are transitioning into males. In an aquarium population composed entirely of females, the extension of the third dorsal ray is a certain sign of sex change starting to occur. As a female Randalls Anthias changes into a male, a dramatic colour change occurs. The ventral fins develop a thick red band (as can be seen in the above photographed specimen which was undergoing transition) with yellow centre. At this time, the upper lip extends somewhat, giving the fish a slightly more fat-lipped appearance (this is fairly subtle but more obvious when a male and female are compared side by side). As the change progresses further, the anal, caudal, and dorsal fin tips become more angular and develop long filaments; the anal and dorsal fins turning red and magenta, and the caudal fin changing to a blue-purple hue. The iris also changes from yellow to purple. Much later into the transition, the fish eventually develops thick horizontal bands of red and magenta on the flanks. May also be seen on sale as Randall's Fairy Basslet.",
        "feeding": "In the wild, this species is constantly on the lookout for food, taking zooplankton from the water column.

As with other members of the same genus, this goby forms a symbiotic partnership with an almost blind alpheid shrimp; together they share the safety of a burrow which the shrimp digs/maintains, and the goby keeps watch for predators. Whilst the shrimp is working, it maintains antennal contact with its goby partner posted at the entrance of the shared burrow. If the shrimp detects the quivering motion of the goby\"\u2122s caudal fin during an unusual situation, it reacts by immediately withdrawing into the depths of the burrow. The entrance to the shared burrow will be closed at night, and only one entrance is usually open at any one time. The shrimp will only emerge from the burrow whilst it can have tactile contact with the goby. These fish are peaceful, except towards conspecifics (especially males) - so keep only one per tank or else obtain a mated pair.

This bottom dwelling species is most often found in association with the cidaroid sea urchin Eucidaris thouarsii, and is a facultative cleaner of other fishes. This is a charming little fish that makes a wonderful addition to the reef aquarium. With pretty colouration and a peaceful nature, Red Head Gobies have been known to reproduce in captivity, so would make for an interesting breeding project. As previously mentioned, Red Head Gobies are regularly observed servicing fish that have ectoparasites, helping to control diseases such as Lymphocystis and marine whitespot. An advantage over most other cleaner fishes is that the Red Head Goby is not an \"obligate cleaner\" (i.e. it does not rely on cleaning/eating parasites for optimal health). As such, the Red Head Goby will do just as well in a healthy aquarium where it is offered quality commercially prepared foodstuffs. This diminutive goby rarely shows aggression towards other species, although it will fight with members of its own kind, especially in smaller aquaria where space and territories are more limited. Large groups (7+) can be kept if the system is spacious; however in smaller aquaria it is advisable to keep either a single specimen or a known mated pair. Although these gobies cannot be sexed externally, it is often fairly easy to pick out a compatible pair at your local aquarium store as they may have paired off and be resting very close to one another. With regards to compatibility, Red Head Gobies are ideal for community reef aquaria; they are also often purported to coexist with a number of unlikely large predators, which usually tend to leave the gobies alone on account of their known cleaning services. However, much caution is necessary as all fish vary in personality and temperament and there can be no guarantees when it comes to their safety with such tankmates present. Observe carefully and if in any doubt, do not add them to your aquarium. It is not advisable to add Red Head Gobies to an aquarium containing predatory crabs.

If you wish to raise a larger number of fry, offer the pair a spawning medium such as a short section of small diameter pvc pipe, and once the eggs have been laid/fertilised, the pipe and eggs can be carefully moved to a separate aquarium (with identical water conditions) where they will be safe from predation. You will need to ensure that the eggs are very gently aerated in the absence of the parent fish. The time it takes for the eggs to hatch will vary depending on water temperature and other factors, but on average this is usually around 8 days. The larvae can be fed on zooplankton and small rotifers, moving on to larger foodstuffs (such as baby brineshrimp) as they grow and metamorphose into small versions of the adults."

        "care": "The Red Scooter Blenny is known from protected coastal reefs, where it inhabits areas of rubble and algae covered rocks. Like its close relative, the Scooter Blenny (S. ocellatus), this species has an interesting method of locomotion, using oversized ventral fins to \"\u02dcscoot\"\u2122 along the substrate and habitually perch as it feeds on microfauna. The blotchy colour pattern allows this species to blend into its environment on the reef with great effect. When keeping the Red Scooter Blenny in the home aquarium, it is vitally important that the tank is fully mature, with plenty of live rock and a living sand bed which will provide the fish with natural foodstuffs. For this reason, although Red Scooter Blennies do not grow especially large, an aquarium with a decent footprint (length and width) is important to provide enough food on a continual basis. Without such nourishment, these fish tend to waste away. In larger aquaria, multiple specimens can be kept together in the same tank, ideally one male, with several females - all of which should be introduced simultaneously. The male will use his elaborate dorsal fin to display to the females during courtship rituals. If more than one male is present, the rivals will both use their dorsal fins as a show of dominance. To keep more than one male in the same tank, the aquarium must be of generous proportions, with plenty of visual barriers, and the specimens added simultaneously when juvenile. Tankmates should be small and peaceful, so that the Red Scooter Blenny is not bullied or harassed at feeding times. Do not keep with anemones, as these docile bottom dwellers are likely to be consumed. May also be seen on sale as the Pink Scooter Blenny.",
        "feeding": "Can be challenging to feed. Absolutely MUST be kept in an established tank with plenty of live rock and a living sand bed, which will provide a natural supply of tiny invertebrate foods. In addition, offer small meaty items such as vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, finely chopped Mysis shrimp, finely chopped krill etc; however, be sure to make the foodstuffs a small enough size for the Red Scooter Blenny to eat. Before purchasing, please be aware that this species must be provided with natural prey (non-live foods rarely sustain them for any great length of time), and a constant supply of tiny foods for this purpose could be cultured in a fishless refugium.",
        "breeding": "This species has been spawned in captivity, although raising the fry presents many difficulties. When ready to spawn, a well conditioned pair will swim up from the substrate during the evening (usually after lights out), rising into the water column whilst locking fins, and culminating in a simultaneous release of gametes."

If this is attempted by advanced aquarists, certain invertebrates must be avoided (see above) and do ensure that the tank is of large proportions - this way the fish is less likely to continually pick at any particular sessile invertebrate and cause irreparable damage. The Red Stripe Angelfish is an active fish and grows a little larger than some of the other dwarf angelfish species, therefore requiring plenty of space. Cramped quarters will also heighten the aggression level of the Red Stripe Angelfish towards small peaceful species. Keep only one specimen per tank, and not with any other Centropyge species.

Juveniles of this species mimic the Red Stripe Angelfish (Centropyge eibli). The relationship is Batesian, in that the juvenile tang avoids predation because it resembles the less-palatable angelfish. As the fish mature, the red stripes gradually disappear and the tail takes on a beautiful lunate shape. Due to an active nature and moderate adult size, the Red Stripe Mimic Tang requires a good sized aquarium with vigorous filtration and plenty of water movement and oxygenation. These fish are generally safe in the reef aquarium, providing they are well fed. A mature tank is necessary to help ensure that your Red Stripe Mimic Tang settles in well; in particular these fish enjoy grazing upon filamentous algae growing upon the decor. Arrange the live rock to create a sloping reef, with plenty of boltholes for the fish, should they feel the need to dash for cover at any time. Keep only one per tank, and not with any other Acanthurus species or direct food competitors, as these fish can be highly territorial. In very large aquaria, it is possible to maintain these fish alongside Tangs of other genera such as Ctenochaetus, Naso, and Zebrasoma \"\u201c but ideally they should be of a similar size and added simultaneously. However, personalities do vary between individuals, so observe your fish very carefully to ensure that there are no problems. It is not advisable to house this fish with the Red Stripe Angelfish (Centropyge eibli) that it mimics, as the tang is likely to show much aggression towards the angelfish. May also be seen on sale as Indian Mimic Tang, Indian Ocean Mimic Tang, or Mimic Eibli Tang.",
        "feeding": "Feed a varied diet for omnivores, with a large vegetable component, in small amounts several times per day.

Juveniles are often seen shoaling in groups with adult females and one adult male, along with other species of Cirrhilabrus or Paracheilinus wrasses, as they feed on zooplankton in the water column. This is a variable fish in terms of looks; the anterior part of the body is rosy red in colouration, fading to a peach or pale pink colour posteriorly. As the fish mature, the red scales at the front end of the fish develop dark edges. The colouration of the fins is also variable, with the dorsal usually bright red or orange anteriorly, and the other fins a mixture of peach or pale pink with blue-purple fin rays. There is a light blue margin to the anal fin and the posterior of the dorsal fin, along with a thin blue marking through the caudal fin. Dominant males will be much more vibrantly coloured compared to the females, and during courtship rituals, the males can undergo spectacular colour changes within seconds, turning almost white in order to attract a mate. In the home aquarium, it is best to keep either a single specimen or a group consisting of just one male with several females. Be sure to add the entire group simultaneously, or else add all females before the male. In the confines of the aquarium, large males will behave aggressively towards other fairy wrasses and other small wrasse species introduced after them. Unless you are blessed with a system of vast proportions, never attempt to keep more than one male together. The tank should be aquascaped with plenty of live rock, in order for the fish to have ample places to hide amongst should they feel threatened. Newly acclimatised fish may be quite shy, but in the presence of peaceful tankmates, they should soon gain much confidence and swim out in open water areas. It is best not to house the Red Velvet Fairy Wrasse with large, intimidating species such as some of the bigger Angels and Tangs. Likewise, do not keep alongside small timid planktivores such as dottybacks, as the Red Velvet Fairy Wrasse can be a little boisterous and competitive at feeding times. Provide your fish with consistently high water quality, decent current, and plenty of aeration. Tight fitting coverslides are an absolute must as these fish are expert jumpers.

As with other members of the same genus, this goby forms a symbiotic partnership with an almost blind alpheid shrimp; together they share the safety of a burrow which the shrimp digs/maintains, and the goby keeps watch for predators. Whilst the shrimp is working, it maintains antennal contact with its goby partner posted at the entrance of the shared burrow. If the shrimp detects the quivering motion of the goby's caudal fin during an unusual situation, it reacts by immediately withdrawing into the depths of the burrow. The entrance to the shared burrow will be closed at night, and only one entrance is usually open at any one time. The shrimp will only emerge from the burrow whilst it can have tactile contact with the goby. These fish are peaceful, and may be kept in groups if all are added simultaneously when juvenile; when keeping more than one, do ensure that there are plenty of visual barriers amongst the decor. Provided with a reasonable depth of coral sand and a good selection of loose coral rubble pieces that vary in size (not too big to be moved) these hardy little candy-striped gobies will do very well in the home aquarium. A shrimp partner is not strictly necessary, but if they can be acquired together, they will make such a fascinating display, captivating the observer for hours on end. The usual shrimp that partners the Red-banded Goby is Alpheus ochrostriatus, but these gobies often accept different Alpheus spp. if a specific one cannot be found. Your dealer may be able to acquire the two together, it is certainly worth asking. Tankmates should be of a peaceable nature, and be aware that the goby may predate on smaller species of ornamental shrimp.

Here, they feed on algae and small invertebrates and spend a good portion of their time in small crevices with just their heads protruding, keeping a watchful eye on their surroundings. The Red-spot Flymo is often regarded as a utility fish for helping to control various algal growths in the aquarium. However, these are very personable fish and are fascinating to observe, regardless of their excellent ability at removing and consuming algae. The tank must be well established, and of a good size; these combtooth blennies have been known to starve in smaller quarters once the main food source has been depleted and not had time to re-establish. When Red-spot Flymo blennies feed, skip over rocks, graze d\u00c3\u00a9cor and generally go about their business, they tend to stir up detritus where it goes into suspension and is then removed by the filtration. Ensure that the tank has efficient filtration with areas of brisk water movement (in order to simulate the surge-like conditions this fish favours) along with some calmer resting spots out of the current. As this species requires a mature tank, it works out well that this should be the last fish added to the tank, preferably at a size around 2.5\"\u009d where it should not be over-dominant. However, in general, Red-spot Flymo blennies can be fairly feisty and quite territorial over the bottom of the aquarium, particularly as they mature; therefore it is best to keep only one per tank, and careful consideration given to tankmates - avoiding other blennies and similar-looking bottom dwelling species such as gobies (unless you are blessed with a tank of vast proportions incorporating a huge number of visual barriers amongst the rockwork, and more than enough food to go round on a continual basis). It should be noted that the Red-spot Flymo will not feed on every kind of algae - they particularly relish the filamentous type, but will ignore bubble and slime algae. Ensure corals are firmly attached, as large blennies may disturb them with their feeding habits and when hopping about looking for a suitable perch from which they can survey their domain. May also be seen on sale as the Red Spotted Blenny.",

        "care": "The Redfin Fairy Wrasse is known from the reefs of Indonesia and the Philippines, where it is typically found in areas of moderate current, to depths of 40m (131ft). Juveniles are often seen shoaling in groups with adult females and one adult male, along with other species of Cirrhilabrus or Paracheilinus wrasses, as they feed on zooplankton in the water column. This is an all over red-orange fish, with the colour fading to yellow or white ventrally. Dominant males are much more intensely coloured, with larger, brighter red dorsal and anal fins, and long filaments on the ventral fins. The dorsal, anal, and caudal fins also have thin bright blue margins. In the home aquarium, it is best to keep either a single specimen or a group consisting of just one male with several females. Be sure to add the entire group simultaneously, or else add all females before the male. In the confines of the aquarium, large males will behave aggressively towards other fairy wrasses and other small wrasse species introduced after them. Unless you are blessed with a system of vast proportions, never attempt to keep more than one male together. The tank should be aquascaped with plenty of live rock, in order for the fish to have ample places to hide amongst should they feel threatened. Newly acclimatised fish may be quite shy, but in the presence of peaceful tankmates, they should soon gain much confidence and swim out in open water areas. It is best not to house the Redfin Fairy Wrasse with large, intimidating species such as some of the bigger Angels and Tangs. Likewise, do not keep alongside small timid planktivores such as dottybacks, as the Redfin Fairy Wrasse can be a little boisterous and competitive at feeding times. Provide your fish with consistently high water quality, decent current, and plenty of aeration. Tight fitting coverslides are an absolute must as these fish are expert jumpers. You may sometimes see this fish labelled as the Redfin Wrasse or Ruby Finned Fairy Wrasse.",

        "care": "Despite being quite readily available in the trade, the electric blue Regal Tang can be fairly challenging to keep in the home aquarium and its care requirements should not be taken lightly. This fish requires an XL mature system if it is to do well in captivity. Ideally the tank will be over 6ft in length, will have been set up for several months, and will include plenty of living rock. Filtration should be oversized, with highly efficient protein skimming and powerful circulation. In the wild, Regal Tangs are found in loose aggregations a metre or so above the substrate in current-swept terraces of the seaward reefs. When startled, they dive for cover amongst the branches of Pocillopora corals. The bulk of their diet is made up of zooplankton, but they do consume some algae. The tank should be aquascaped with a decent amount of living rock to provide welcome bolt holes, leaving an open swimming space along the front of the tank. Regal Tangs should not harm sessile invertebrates, provided that they are feeding well and consuming a balanced diet. This species is not overly aggressive and can be kept in groups if space permits (specimens should be of the same size and introduced simultaneously). Juvenile fish shoal together, but adults require much more territory and will squabble if there is not enough room. For this reason it is best to keep one adult per tank, unless you are blessed with a vast system. Tankmates should be of a peaceable nature and not direct food competitors. Avoid fish that are too boisterous and which might prevent the Regal Tang from feeding, as head and lateral line erosion (HLLE) can quickly develop if the fish is undernourished, as can marine whitespot, which this species is prone to if stressed. Close relatives from the acanthurid (tang/surgeonfish) family are best avoided too. When choosing a Regal Tang for your aquarium, do ensure that they do not look underweight with a \"pinched in\" appearance, and instead have a nice full-looking body and are alert and inquisitive. A period of quarantine can be a valuable procedure for the acclimatisation of all livestock, and it is of particular importance for the Regal Tang which, as mentioned above, can be quite susceptible to developing whitespot. This can be difficult to treat in the reef aquarium. Ideally the fish should be quarantined and carefully observed in a separate aquarium for at least a fortnight before being introduced into your main display tank. Be very careful when netting or handling your Regal Tang, as the sharp caudal spines can inflict nasty wounds. May also be seen on sale as the Hippo Tang. ***This species is not recommended for beginners.***",

        "care": "The Ring Wrasse is known from coral reefs and rocky substrates, to depths of 30m (131ft). Juveniles are usually solitary, but adults are often observed feeding in groups on crustaceans and tiny fishes. This elongate wrasse is one of 4 currently known species of Hologymnosus, and although all are hardy, beautiful fish, they do attain a very large adult size. Due to this and their extremely active nature, they require a voluminous aquarium. These fish feed mainly on small, hard-shelled prey including crustaceans and molluscs, so it is a species that should be added to the reef tank with some caution. Although it should not trouble corals, it will feed on a variety of invertebrates (see Reef Aquarium Compatibility section). The tank should be mature and furnished with plenty of living rock to provide feeding opportunities, shady hiding places and visual barriers. There should be a deep sand bed of around 3\"\u009d (7.5cm) or so, in order that the wrasse may bury itself at night or if startled. Keep either a single specimen, or, if the tank is large enough, a good sized group of 5 or 6 individuals (introduced simultaneously, when young and of the same size). Tankmates must be chosen with care due to the large size attained by these wrasse. Young Ring Wrasses rarely cause problems in a community type set-up, but as they grow, larger adults will prey on small passive fish, e.g. flasher wrasses, fairy wrasses, and firefish, so combinations such as these are best avoided. Powerful filtration and circulation with a high level of oxygenation are a must, as are tight fitting coverslides; these fish are expert jumpers. All male Ring Wrasses are the result of a sex change; these fish are protogynous sequential hermaphrodites and there are three primary phases, their colour and size depending on whether they are terminal phase (TP) males a.k.a \"supermales\", initial phase (IP) males, or females. All juveniles start out as females. IP males and females have the ability to change into TP males and this switch includes a dramatic change of size and coloration. Once transformed from IP male or female to TP male, the change is permanent. It should be noted that in the aquarium, TP males are particularly territorial. The colour of these fish also depends on age, mood, and geographical location. Juvenile fish sometimes display a thick horizontal dark brown bar along the flanks, closely resembling juveniles of the Blue Blanquillo (Malacathus latovittatus), and other times this horizontal bar fades to brown or yellow, revealing a series of 17-19 thin black vertical bars along the flanks. The caudal fin is also slightly rounded in juveniles. Adult females are a muted black; TP males are deeper bodied with green flanks (sometimes shading to blue-green ventrally) with numerous bluish red bars, often with a pale yellowish bar on body above the origin of anal fin, and the head is light purplish with a few green to blue-green bands radiating from each eye and onto the snout. The caudal fin is emarginate in adult fish. Interestingly, the Indian Ocean & Red Sea TP male form sports a central white band, whereas the Pacific Ocean variant displays a pale peduncular area when in breeding dress.

Once released, the miniscule fry are free-swimming, but at great risk from predation by the adults. A nursery tank and a supply of rotifers (later freshly hatched baby brineshrimp) will be necessary. The free-swimming fry have little in the way of a yolk sac and will need to be provided with food immediately."

It is essential that this species is placed into an XXL mature system with an abundance of live rock, where it can continually browse upon its natural fare of sponges, tunicates, zoanthids, and algae. A fishless refugium can also be utilised to grow suitable foodstuffs on small pieces of live rock for your Rock Beauty, and these placed into the main tank on a rotational basis. Specialised sponge-based frozen foods purposely developed for angelfish are available too. Specimens that do not receive the proper diet may appear to be feeding well, but after a few months, will gradually fade away due to lack of proper nutrition. If you can provide a Rock Beauty with a suitable home and diet, be sure to choose a healthy specimen that is neither too small nor too large (3-4\" is about the ideal size) as tiny or adult specimens can be reluctant feeders and tend not to cope with the stress of capture and transport quite so well. Very young fish may even try to feed from the slime coat of other fish within the same aquarium, causing them irritation. Check with your dealer that the fish is feeding well on the correct foods (ask to see this) and that it appears bright and inquisitive. The most suitable aquarium for a Rock Beauty will be extra wide as well as lengthy. This will enable you to aquascape the tank with a large quantity of live rock (which will provide ongoing grazing opportunities, and refuges for when the angelfish is resting or if startled) whilst still being able to maintain a good amount of open swimming space. Despite its size, this is a fish that is easily bullied. Tankmates should not be aggressive, and there should be no other angelfish present. Keep only one Rock Beauty per tank. Juvenile specimens are largely yellow with a small black spot towards the top of the rear of the flanks.

Although these pretty fish are considered much less aggressive than many of the damselfish species, their assertiveness often increases with age and maturity. It is therefore advisable to keep either a single specimen, a known male-female pair, or a large sized odd-numbered shoal (9+) introduced simultaneously as juveniles into a spacious tank with plenty of hiding places amongst the rockwork. Smaller groups are often known to suffer fatalities. Choose tankmates with care, avoiding any really docile species such as firefish and cardinalfish. The Royal Blue Damselfish is capable of dramatic colour change from blue to completely black when stressed - this is thought to help the fish avoid predation. May also be seen on sale as the Blue Sapphire Damselfish or Springer's Demoiselle.",

Male damselfish typically establish a territory and prepare surfaces of rubble or coral for females to deposit their adhesive, demersal eggs. Once the eggs are laid the male will quickly fertilize them and aggressively defend them from any intruders. He will also aerate the eggs until they hatch."

They have been observed swimming in small, loose aggregations among the inner reefs where brittle corals and coralline algae flourish, an area shared by damselfishes and small wrasses. In the home aquarium, this diminutive angel can be surprisingly territorial, and so it is best kept in a large tank with plenty of live rockwork that has a multitude of visual barriers and bolt holes. Unfortunately, this fish will nip at quite a range of invertebrate life, so it is not suitable for every setup. Live rock is considered essential though, as it will provide the fish with ongoing grazing opportunities. Keep only one specimen per tank, and not with any other angelfish from the Centropyge genus. We recommend that the Royal Blue Pygmy Angelfish is the last addition to an aquarium, as otherwise, it can be extremely territorial when introducing new tankmates into what it perceives as its established domain. Tankmates should not be too docile, being able to \"look after themselves\", but at the same time, not so large and predatory that they see the angelfish as prey. The colour of this species is quite variable. Juveniles are typically bright royal blue to black with a pale or hyaline caudal fin, and adults can range from being dark brown/almost black to a golden brown colour. This species is replaced by C. fisheri in the Hawaiian Islands, and there is some speculation that they are regional variants of the same species (in which case the name C. flavicauda may eventually become invalid).",

It is usually observed in small harems, comprised of one male and several females, browsing the substrate for molluscs and foraminiferans. This elongate wrasse is one of 11 currently known species of Pseudojuloides, and although all are incredibly beautiful, this genus is considered rather delicate and does have some specialist care requirements that must be fulfilled by the advanced aquarist if these fish are to acclimatise well to life in captivity. The Royal Pencil Wrasse requires a very mature, spacious aquarium with plenty of healthy live rock and sand that supports its natural diet on an ongoing basis, if it is to thrive. If added to a newly set up tank, it will starve to death. There should be plenty of hiding places amongst the rockwork, with enough depth of substrate (7.5cm/3\" of fine sand) for the fish to bury if it feels threatened. Because of the difficulties in feeding this wrasse, it should not be kept with fish that require a similar food source to survive, as otherwise one species may out-compete the other. There should be relatively calm areas in the tank that allow it to locate food successfully. Tankmates should be peaceful and of an easygoing nature so that the Royal Pencil Wrasse does not feel harassed and subsequently stops venturing out to feed. Keep only one male per tank; groups, comprised of one male and several females, can sometimes be kept together successfully (added simultaneously) but larger numbers should only ever be considered for exceptionally voluminous aquaria, as in the average sized aquarium, natural prey will deplete too quickly with that many fish requiring the same diet. Do not house with different Pseudojuloides species, other wrasses, or pugnacious dottybacks and hawkfishes, as they will fight for territory. When choosing your Royal Pencil Wrasse, check that its body is not emaciated, and that it is actively searching for food. It is not uncommon for a newly added pencil wrasse to hide beneath the substrate whilst it adjusts to its new surroundings and altered circadian rhythm; in such cases it is best to leave them be, they will usually begin to explore within a couple of days. These fish require stable and optimal water conditions at all times, so a good filtration and maintenance regime is a must. Ensure that the aquarium has tight fitting coverslides with no small gaps in the hood, as these fish are expert jumpers. May also be seen on sale as Pink Pencil Wrasse (a name that really only suits the pinkish-orange females) or Severns' Wrasse. Not recommended for beginners.",

This diminutive, bright scarlet and yellow fish is found amongst areas of broken coral rubble that is interspersed with outcrops of soft and stony corals, to depths of 38m (125ft). Like its close relative, the Scooter Blenny, this species has an interesting method of locomotion, using oversized ventral fins to \"scoot\" along the substrate and habitually perch as it feeds on microfauna. Although this fish has been seen in the trade for several years, it has only recently been formally described. When keeping the Ruby Red Dragonet in the home aquarium, it is vitally important that the tank is fully mature, with plenty of live rock and a living sand bed which will provide the fish with natural foodstuffs. For this reason, although Ruby Red Dragonets do not grow especially large, an aquarium with a decent footprint (length and width) is important to provide enough food on a continual basis. Without such nourishment, these fish tend to waste away. In larger aquaria, multiple specimens can be kept together in the same tank, ideally one male, with several females - all of which should be introduced simultaneously. The male will use his elaborate dorsal fin to display to the females during courtship rituals. If more than one male is present, the rivals will both use their dorsal fins as a show of dominance. To keep more than one male in the same tank, the aquarium must be of generous proportions, with plenty of visual barriers, and the specimens added simultaneously when juvenile. Tankmates should be small and peaceful, so that the Ruby Red Dragonet is not bullied or harassed at feeding times. Do not keep with anemones, as these docile bottom dwellers are likely to be consumed. The Red Ruby Dragonet (S. sycorax) is very similar in appearance to S. tudorjonesi from Cenderawasih Bay, Indonesia, although the latter tends to lack the intense yellow colour of the ventral and pectoral fins, the white markings on the head, and has much reduced white markings over the body. In addition, the first dorsal-fin spine is the longest in S. sycorax, whereas the third spine is longest in S. tudorjonesi. Interestingly, the Ruby Red Dragonet, S. sycorax is named for the red-robed and cloaked Sycorax warriors from the BBC sci-fi series, Dr Who in allusion to the colouration and the ostentatiousness of their garb.",

Before purchasing, please be aware that this species must be provided with natural prey (non-live foods rarely sustain them for any great length of time), and a constant supply of tiny foods for this purpose could be cultured in a fishless refugium.",
        "breeding": "This species has been bred in very small numbers on a commercial basis. When ready to spawn, a well conditioned pair will swim up from the substrate during the evening (usually after lights out), rising into the water column whilst locking fins, and culminating in a simultaneous release of gametes. S. sycorax produces smaller spawns with a lower fertility rate than either S. ocellatus or S. stellatus, the offspring also smaller and slower to develop in comparison."

The larger the tank, the better, as then the fish is much less likely to continually pick at any one particular sessile invertebrate and cause irreparable damage. Also, ensuring that the fish is well-fed means that it should not pose any real threat to reef aquaria - although occasional specimens may nip at some invertebrate life (see below) it should be noted that this only usually occurs if dietary requirements and feeding frequency are not being met. Careful observation is recommended. The Rusty Angelfish should be kept singly and not with any other members of the Centropyge genus. Although this is a fish that can be quite shy when first introduced to the aquarium, and may take a little time to settle, once it has become accustomed to its surroundings, it can be rather territorial when new species (particularly docile/peaceful fish) are introduced to the tank afterwards.

Juveniles are solitary and stay close inshore, whereas adults are encountered further out in pairs or small aggregations, where they may be observed feeding on coral polyps, filamentous algae, fish eggs, and small invertebrates. This species is regarded as moderately difficult, and is therefore recommended for advanced aquarists only. A large, mature system is requisite, along with ample live rock for the fish to browse upon/hide amongst and a large open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Medium sized specimens tend to acclimatise better to aquarium life, adapting much more quickly to various prepared foods, so try and choose a healthy, alert specimen around 10cm (4\") in length. Smaller sized fish may be reluctant to feed, and larger specimens can be very finicky, requiring significant space and faultless water conditions. An aquarium that has some areas of lush filamentous algae growth will also aid your new fish in settling into its new surroundings; however, as with other butterflyfish species, these fish demand excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of brisk current. Some aquarists have successfully kept Saddleback Butterflyfish alongside some of the more noxious soft corals, but this is something of a risk, and they should be observed carefully. Stony corals and other sessile invertebrates will be constantly nipped at, so unfortunately must be avoided. Keep only one Saddleback Butterflyfish per tank (unless a mated pair is acquired) and not with any other butterflyfish as they will squabble over territories. Whilst they can be a little shy when first introduced, providing them with ample retreats amongst the live rock will ensure they quickly gain confidence and venture out into the open. Once settled, these peaceful fish actually become very assertive feeders and will compete with most other fish species. Adult fish develop a filament extending posteriorly from the upper part of the soft portion of the dorsal fin. May also be seen on sale as the Saddled Butterflyfish.",

They are closely associated with the Sebae Anemone (Heteractis crispa) and Haddon's Carpet Anemone (Stichodactyla haddoni), which afford them lifelong protection from predators and skin parasites. This is a popular and robust aquarium fish which thrives in mature reef aquaria. A host anemone - some of which can be a little tricky to maintain successfully in captivity - is not strictly necessary for your clownfish as most reef set ups contain plenty of hiding places, no large predatory fish, and sometimes cleaner shrimp/cleaner wrasse. In the absence of an anemone, some clownfish take up residence in what they see as a suitable coral substitute - which may cause them to retract in irritation as the clownfish wallow - but this isn\"\u2122t always the case. Many species of clownfish (including the Saddleback) are now captive-raised, so wherever possible the conscientious aquarist should aim to source these hardier specimens for the home aquarium, in turn helping to take pressure off the reefs. This is a beautiful but variable species, with a brown, orange, or almost black body. There is a thick white vertical bar behind each eye, a large white saddle shaped marking dorsally over the centre of the body, and thick white edging to the black caudal fin; sometimes there is an additional white marking over the caudal peduncle. As these fish can be somewhat territorial, keep only one pair per tank, providing them with ample space and plenty of visual barriers amongst the d\u00c3\u00a9cor. It is also best not to mix this species with other species of clownfish as they will fight. With regards to sexing, all clownfish are born as males. A wild colony may consist of a breeding pair, which cohabit with a few non-reproductive smaller male specimens. When the female dies, the dominant male will change sex and become the female. This is known as protandrous sequential hermaphroditism. In the case of two juvenile specimens in the home aquarium, the larger of the two will become the female. Please be aware that these fish are very sensitive to treatment with copper remedies.",
        "feeding": "Offer a varied diet including meaty items such as Mysis shrimp, krill, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp etc, plus herbivore flakes and greenfoods.",
        "breeding": "Saddleback Clownfish have been bred in captivity. The pair will choose and clean a spawning site, usually a smooth rocky surface such as a flat wall inside a cave, and if a host anemone is present, the spawning site will usually be within close vicinity for protection. Several hundred orange eggs will be deposited. These adhere to the substrate via fine threads at the ventral pole, and the male will aerate them by fanning them with his pectoral fins whilst guarding against predators. The eggs will hatch after 7-8 days, and the larvae typically settle after another week or so. The tiny fry are left to fend for themselves and should be fed on suitably tiny foodstuffs such as live rotifers, moving on to baby brineshrimp after a few days. It is unlikely that fry will survive the attentions of the other fish in a community reef set-up."

        "care": "The Saffron Coral Goby is a fascinating and comical little fish that in the wild is closely associated with colonies of broadly branching Acropora spp. corals. This brightly coloured fish is of a peaceful nature and makes a wonderful addition to mature reef aquaria containing colonies of SPS corals; these fish very much enjoy swimming and hiding amongst such polyps. Although often recommended for nano aquaria because of its diminutive size, caution should be exercised for two reasons. Firstly, smaller tanks will limit the number of individuals you can keep together; only one specimen is recommended in small nano type tanks, otherwise there will be constant arguments over territory which could result in the untimely demise of the weaker individual. Secondly, the more space available in a reef setting, the chances are that there will be much larger, stable colonies of suitable SPS corals available, and so it is less likely that these fish will damage any one individual beyond repair as they go about their daily routines (hiding/resting amongst the branches, and feeding on the occasional mucous polyp). If these types of corals are not being cultivated in your aquarium, invest in several coral skeletons so that these fish have something natural to interact with and give them a sense of security. Saffron Coral Gobies may be kept in groups (but only in larger quarters where there is an abundance of hiding places/territories), and oftentimes these fish will pair up and spawn. With regards to tankmates, these should all be small, non-aggressive feeders. These gobies actually produce a toxic body slime that deters many species from trying to consume them. Having said that, obviously do not house these fish with large carnivores. May also be seen on sale as the Citron Goby.",

        "breeding": "It is fairly common for the Saffron Coral Goby to spawn in the home aquarium. However, raising the young is extremely challenging. These fish tend to strip a small area of coral polyps in order to create a place to deposit the eggs, although other sites are not unheard of. The male fish will dance/quiver in front of the female and when she is ready to spawn, she will deposit her eggs on the coral branch, and these are immediately fertilised and subsequently guarded by the male. The eggs are very small (less than 1mm in diameter) and can number several hundred. The presence of the eggs on the coral may cause a small amount of tissue recession in that area, but this should recover quickly once the eggs have hatched (4-5 days, dependent on water temperature). The larvae are miniscule and require appropriately sized foodstuffs such as cultured rotifers and copepods."

These beautiful fish possess fewer but larger pharyngeal teeth compared to other Zebrasoma species, and are frequently observed grazing on leafy macroalgae. This is a large and long-lived species, with specimens regularly reaching 25-30 years of age. A very spacious and well filtered aquarium with areas of decent current and a good level of oxygenation is requisite. Despite its eventual adult size, this is one of the more peaceable tangs. However, only one should be kept per tank, and it should not be housed with any similar species. The diet must contain a good proportion of vegetable matter in order to prevent head and lateral line erosion, and it should therefore only be added to mature aquaria where there is a good growth of algae on the rockwork. Indeed, it will even enjoy browsing on nuisance filamentous algae. As long as this fish is kept well fed, it should not pose any real problems in a reef set up. Occasional specimens have been known to nip at large polyp stony (LPS) corals, but this is not the norm.

Adults feed primarily on crabs and sea urchins, and are known to spawn in deep waters. Juvenile fish live amongst clumps of floating Sargassum, which affords them protection until they are more fully developed; in fact, some have been observed drifting over 100 miles from the nearest coast! The Sargassum Triggerfish is one of the few triggerfish species that can be safely kept in most reef aquaria. Sessile invertebrates are typically ignored, but it must be mentioned that larger Sargassum Triggerfish are likely to eat any ornamental shrimp they come across. These fish are therefore ideal for those spacious reef set ups without any crustaceans. Sargassum Triggerfish can be kept in a mated pair, or even in groups if introduced simultaneously. Filtration should be efficient and the water well oxygenated with areas of brisk current. Although this species may be a little shy when first introduced to the aquarium, the fish will soon gain confidence and may even spit water at the surface in anticipation of feeding time. Tankmates should be chosen with care as Sargassum Triggerfish, whilst not anywhere near as belligerent as other members of the family, can still be moderately aggressive. Tiny, placid fish should be avoided. As with all fish, personalities can differ and there are occasional reports of \"\u02dcrogue fish\"\u2122. The vast majority of specimens will be safe in a reef environment, but we advise that you observe your individual specimens carefully. As these fish are often found at reasonable depths, the water temperature should be kept below 27 \u00b0C, and introduction to brighter lighting should be carried out gradually.

Tankmates must be chosen with care however, as the Scarlet Hawkfish has a surprisingly capacious mouth and will prey on ornamental shrimp, snails, crabs, worms, and may behave quite aggressively towards other bottom dwellers. Large sized adults are capable of taking small fish. Scarlet Hawkfish will spend a large amount of their time resting in a preferred shelter, or hopping from rock to rock, watching everything going on around them with much interest. However, they have lightning quick reflexes and will dart out to snatch at any food morsels in the vicinity. Powerful filtration, skimming, and water movement are a must for this surge-dwelling species; indeed, highly oxygenated water is absolutely essential for their long-term wellbeing. In the wild, Scarlet Hawkfish are often found amidst churning, current-swept reef fronts, where they hide amongst branching corals such as Pocillopora and Stylophora. Keep only one per tank, unless a mated pair, and do not keep with any other hawkfish species or slender placid fish such as dart gobies or firefish. The Scarlet Hawkfish can be very territorial, so it is best added to the tank last, after all your other fish are well established.

For this reason, although Scooter Blennies do not grow especially large, an aquarium with a decent footprint (length and width) is important to provide enough food on a continual basis. Without such nourishment, these fish tend to waste away. In larger aquaria, multiple specimens can be kept together in the same tank, ideally one male, with several females - all of which should be introduced simultaneously. The male will use his elaborate dorsal fin to display to the females during courtship rituals. If more than one male is present, the rivals will both use their dorsal fins as a show of dominance. To keep more than one male in the same tank, the aquarium must be of generous proportions, with plenty of visual barriers, and the specimens added simultaneously when juvenile. Tankmates should be small and peaceful, so that the Scooter Blenny is not bullied or harassed at feeding times. Do not keep with anemones, as these docile bottom dwellers are likely to be consumed.",

The attractive colouration varies greatly depending on the collection location and on the fish's mood. The fish in the photograph above is a Fijian specimen; the fish from Australian waters tend to have less black and more orange/red in the fins, and those from the Cook Islands typically show more blue on the body, a bright red patch on the flanks, and less dark colouration in the dorsal fin.

Large males will behave aggressively towards other fairy wrasses and other small wrasse species introduced after them. It has been known for adult males to lose some of their colouration in captivity when they are maintained alone, and keeping a small harem tends to prevent this from occurring. Do not attempt to house with intimidating fish such as larger species of Angels and Tangs as their presence may make the fairy wrasses feel threatened and then refuse to come out and feed. Having said that, they can eventually become quite boisterous at feeding times, so ensure that any passive feeders do not miss out.

        "care": "The Shotsilk 'Goby' is a peaceful shoaling dartfish known from the relatively shallow waters of exposed seaward reefs. Here these pretty, elongate fish gather in large aggregations, hovering above the substrate amongst the current-swept waters to feed on zooplankton. If startled or when danger approaches, many individuals hastily retreat or 'dart' into the same refuge together. The aquarium should be mature and offer plenty of swimming space. There should be ample nooks and crannies amongst the rockwork for the fish to hide in, as well as a fine sand substrate into which they can bury at night or when startled. As an especially gregarious species, it is important that a good sized group (of at least 5 individuals) are kept together, and these should be added to the aquarium simultaneously. Tankmates should be very peaceful as Shotsilk 'Gobies' are of a somewhat nervous disposition and will not cope well with boisterous companions; indeed, it is most important that they are not intimidated out of feeding so observe carefully. Anthias, blennies, cardinalfish, dragonets, firefish, gobies, and grammas would all work well. Wherever possible, site the tank in an area that does not receive constant foot traffic, and ensure that all illumination switches on and off gradually rather than suddenly, as these fish are so easily spooked. Due to their fast metabolism (and consequent requirement of food offerings several times per day), decent filtration and areas of brisk water movement are essential. Ensure that the tank has tight fitting coverslides and no escape holes where equipment feeds into the aquarium, as these fish are expert jumpers. May also be seen on sale as Zebra Dart Goby, Zebra Dartfish, Barred Dartfish, Zebra Hovergoby, Bar Goby, Chinese Zebra Goby, or Zebra Wormfish.",
        "feeding": "In the wild, this species is constantly on the lookout for food, taking zooplankton from the water column. Due to their fast metabolism, they require feeding in small amounts several times per day (i.e. at least 4 times) if they are to maintain good health. Offer a variety of fine meaty foodstuffs such as Mysis shrimp, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, finely chopped krill/prawns etc in addition to zooplankton preparations (containing copepods and rotifers) which are often available in either frozen or refrigerated forms.",
        "breeding": "This species has spawned in the home aquarium, but to date, no-one has successfully reared the young. Keeping a large sized group of adults will greaten the chances of  having both sexes, and a compatible pair may naturally form. When ready to breed, the male will display his fins and 'mouth' at the female, before swimming parallel with her in a courtship dance. Eggs are deposited in a crevice, with the adults guarding them until they hatch. The resultant fry are minuscule and very sensitive to environmental fluctuations."

        "care": "The Siamese Blenny, also known as the Disco Fang Blenny, is known from coastal and inner coral reefs, at depths from 1-20m (3.3-66ft). Whilst many of the Fang or Sabre-Toothed Blennies are known to parasitize other fish, those from the Meiacanthus genus (of which 28 species have been formerly described) feed only on zooplankton as they hover in the water column, and on tiny benthic invertebrates they find on the reef. Juvenile Siamese Blennies tend to gather in small groups, whereas the adults are solitary or seen in pairs. Meiacanthus species tend to be quite inoffensive, but they do possess two venomous canine-like teeth in the lower jaw that can be employed should they be attacked. Most fish know to leave them alone, but if they are ingested, a quick, sharp bite on the inside of the predator\"\u2122s mouth from the blenny ensures that it is spat out again \"\u201c and it is usually none the worse for wear. These fish do not employ their weaponry in an active manner, instead they use it only as a last resort to defend themselves or their territory. Other fish such as the non-venomous Plagiotremus phenax and juvenile Scolopsis bilineatus have evolved to mimic this species in order to afford themselves protection from predators, even though they do not possess the same effective dentition deterrent as the Meiacanthus species. Whilst Siamese Blennies can sometimes be a little secretive, they are generally far more self-assured than other blenniids (most likely due to the possession of such potent defensive apparatus) and will often be seen hovering about in the water column above the rockwork in an inquisitive manner. Provide the Siamese Blenny with a mature tank that contains an abundance of live rock, so that it may continually graze upon it for small crustaceans; without such quantity of well-established rockwork, these fish will not fare very well. It is best to keep just one specimen per tank, unless you can acquire a known mated pair, as these fish can be a little territorial in the confines of the average aquarium. Will cohabit with most species, except for close relatives and much larger carnivorous fish. Ensure that the tank has tight fitting coverslides as these fish are expert jumpers. Please be aware that whilst the bites of Fang Blennies are not usually dangerous to most people, they can be very painful. Therefore some degree of caution is required when carrying out maintenance in the aquarium, taking particular care not to intrude too closely upon their territory. Never try to hand feed a Fang Blenny.",

These fish are often observed in pairs, and are notorious for making audible grunting sounds when divers approach. The Sixbar Angelfish is a large-growing, active species which requires a voluminous aquarium. This fish is territorial so provide plenty of live rockwork that has a multitude of visual barriers and bolt holes, as well as a roomy swimming space along the front of the tank. Keep only one specimen per tank, and not with any other angelfish. Tankmates should be equally large and belligerent - this species should never be kept with invertebrates or small, passive fish. The aquarium should be well filtered, as these fish are voracious eaters, and there should be areas of decent current and good levels of oxygenation. Sixbar Angelfish feed on many sessile invertebrates in the wild, including sponges, stony corals, and tunicates, so it is not a safe species for every set up; however, it can usually be kept successfully alongside some of the more noxious soft corals. We recommend that the Sixbar Angelfish is the last addition to an aquarium, as otherwise it can behave somewhat pugnaciously when introducing new tankmates into what it perceives as its established domain. Juvenile fish look very different to the adults: young fish are dark-blue/black with numerous white upright but slightly curving stripes on the flanks, originating just in front of the caudal peduncle. The white stripes change to cyan/blue as they meet the dorsal and anal fins, and the two stripes on the head area are blue. Adult fish have a creamy beige body with five dark vertical stripes; a bright white vertical stripe just behind the eye, makes stripe number six. Dark blue dots pepper the entire body, with bright blue spots covering the caudal and posterior portion of the anal fin. It is important to offer a varied diet (see below) in order to retain the vivid colours and to avoid head and lateral line erosion (HLLE). May also be seen on sale as Sixbanded Angelfish.",

It forages mainly at night on crustaceans but will also take small fishes. The aquarium should be spacious and mature, with a soft sandy substrate. Most importantly, it should be securely covered to prevent the eel escaping on to the floor. Create plenty of narrow, shady refuges in the rockwork that the eel can explore and hide amongst, ensuring that all decor is stable and cannot be undermined. Suitable crevices should have a fairly narrow entrance hole but be roomy enough behind for the eel to conceal its entire body within. Most of the day will be spent with its head projecting from this favoured shelter. Unfortunately, this fish is not recommended for reef aquaria, as ornamental crustaceans and small fishes may be eaten, and corals that are not securely attached to the rockwork may be accidentally toppled. The Snowflake Moray grows large and is a voracious eater, so ensure that the filtration/protein skimming is very efficient and capable of coping with the erratic loading that results from big meals and subsequent spikes in waste output. Circulation should be good, with areas of brisk water movement and some calmer resting spots out of the current. This fish is normally mild-mannered, but becomes somewhat frenzied at feeding times - resist the temptation to hand feed youngsters, as adults that associate fingers with food are something of a liability!

The most suitable tankmates really are other large, moderately aggressive species that can look after themselves. To avoid any tussles at feeding time, add the food to several places in the aquarium at the same time. Do take care when carrying out maintenance in an aquarium containing a large, adult Spanish hogfish, as they are capable of inflicting a painful bite if they perceive you as a threat to their territory. It is not uncommon for these fish to become imprinted on their owner; indeed many have been known to enviously push their tankmates aside in a scramble to vie for your attention at the front glass of the aquarium, demanding to be hand-fed; however, as mentioned previously, always use tongs to present the food to them if you wish to avoid being bitten by those canine-like teeth! In the wild, this species is known to hybridise with the Spotfin Hogfish (B. pulchellus).",
        "feeding": "Carnivorous. Will readily accept most meaty frozen foods such as Mysis shrimp, krill, vitamin-enriched brine shrimp, chopped prawns/cockle/mussel/whitebait etc. Juvenile fish will accept flake, adults not so much. Feed small amounts 2 or 3 times per day.",

        "care": "The Spot-tail Butterflyfish is known from reef channels, outer reef slopes, and coral-rich flats and lagoons. Here the adults are typically observed in pairs feeding on soft coral polyps such as Clavularia, Litophyton, Nephthia, and Sarcophyton species, to depths of 50m (164ft), whereas the smaller juveniles tend to stay closer inshore. In the home aquarium, Spot-tail Butterflyfish should be offered plenty of swimming space and a multitude of hiding places. Unfortunately, most soft corals, many stony corals and a whole host of other invertebrates will be picked at and eaten, so these fish are not suitable for reef set-ups. Spot-tail Butterflyfish are best kept singly, as they are more likely to chase conspecifics than many other butterflyfish species. However, in more spacious aquaria, it is possible to keep a known mated pair (although be aware this will not work in smaller quarters). These fish should not be housed with any other butterflyfish species, as within the confines of the home aquarium they will show much hostility towards each other, especially similar-looking species such as C. melannotus; however they are usually safe with non-related fish species that can look after themselves (avoid any small, docile species). As mentioned previously, the tank should contain an abundance of rockwork for the fish to hide amongst, but do leave a large open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. As with all butterflyfishes, this species demands excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of decent current. May also be seen on sale as Spot-tail Coralfish or Tail-spot Butterflyfish.",

        "care": "Keeping Spotted Boxfish in the home aquarium is very risky. This is a species notorious for readily excreting the poison ostracitoxin when stressed - a deadly toxin which is capable of wiping out an entire tank. It is therefore best to house either a single specimen or one male-female pair. Never keep more than one male in the same tank as bickering and subsequent ostracitoxin release is very likely to occur. If tankmates are desired, they must be peaceful so as not to harass the boxfish; however, their continued safety will be precarious, hence why a species-only set up is highly recommended. In the wild, Spotted Boxfish inhabit clear lagoons and reefs. They are considered relatively poor swimmers and for this reason have developed protection via toxin release. The impressive teeth are used to scrape tunicates and sponges off of rocks, which form the bulk of the diet along with various algae, bivalves, snails, polychaete worms, molluscs etc. For this reason, these fish are not suited to reef tanks, although there should be some live rock in the tank to provide welcome shelters and grazing opportunities. A large open swimming space should be provided so that the boxfish are able to swim out and about during daylight hours when they are usually at their most active. Despite their less-than-nimble method of locomotion, Spotted Boxfish are capable of jumping from open topped tanks, so tight fitting coverslides are a must. Care must be taken when carrying out maintenance on the aquarium, so as to keep the fish as calm as possible. Ideally the tank will be situated where there is as little foot traffic going past as possible too. Lights should turn on and off very gradually via the use of a dimmer - sudden bright light can shock the boxfish into toxin release. All foods should be offered towards the bottom of the tank to avoid the boxfish drawing in air when trying to take food from the surface. Boxfish have very small mouths and stomachs and it is of extreme importance that they are fed small amounts throughout the day to prevent starvation (something which may not always be immediately apparent because of the rigid bony plates along the sides of the boxfish). On account of this feeding regime, highly efficient filtration and protein skimming is a must. This species is not suitable for beginners.",

        "care": "Despite its close resemblance to that of a goby, the Spotted Coral Croucher is actually a relative of the scorpionfish family. Cryptic by nature, these fascinating little bottom-dwellers are most at home within the shelter of branching SPS corals such as Pocillopora eydouxi, Stylophora mordax and some species of Acropora, where they navigate the maze of branches by pulling themselves along with their robust pectoral fins. The aquarium should be mature and incorporate plenty of live rock. The presence of healthy established colonies of branching corals is essential, as this is where the Spotted Coral Croucher will take up residence. In the wild, these fish are found in shallow reefs that undergo powerful surge action, so decent water movement, oxygenation, and filtration is important. Keep only one per tank unless your supplier can source you a mated pair. Tankmates should be of a peaceful nature as Spotted Coral Crouchers are very shy feeders and are easily out-competed. It is best to ensure your chosen fish is feeding well before purchase (ask to see the fish being fed) and also whilst it is in quarantine prior to adding to your main display tank. Target feeding small meaty foods with a turkey baster can very much help to ensure your Spotted Coral Croucher is receiving the nutrition it needs, and starting this during the quarantine period can help your fish get used to this process. As they rarely venture out very far from their chosen coral to take food from open water, the aquarist must be prepared to regularly target feed the fish in this way, aiming the food directly into the places where the fish are resting. Take care when handling Spotted Coral Crouchers during acclimatisation and when carrying out maintenance, as they are mildly venomous. Although always rather reclusive, well-settled specimens can become relatively tame, watching everything that the aquarist is doing with much interest (in a manner akin to hawkfish). This species seems to have gained a vast array of common names in addition to Spotted Coral Croucher; indeed, you may also see this fish on sale as the Gumdrop Coral Croucher, Velvetfish, Velvet Coral Croucher, Velvet Goby, Scarlet Spotted Coral Croucher, Scarlet Spotted Velvetfish, Red Speckled Coral Goby, and more. This is just one instance where the use of the Latin name is so valuable! This species bears a very close resemblance to C. madagascariensis of East Africa and C. typus of Haiwaiian waters. It is quite possible that subsequent revisions of the genus will reveal that these are all actually geographic variants of the same species with subtle differences in skin colour/markings.",
        "feeding": "Can be challenging to feed. Requires dedicated target feeding with small meaty items such as vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, Mysis shrimp, zooplankton, and finely chopped krill/prawn/clam/mussel/cockle/fish flesh. Soaking the food in a garlic supplement may be beneficial in order to get the fish interested in feeding on frozen foods.",

        "breeding": "This species has been bred in captivity, and tank-raised specimens are sometimes available. The male entices the female into spawning by performing an elaborate mating dance outside his chosen cave.

The male then drives the female away and takes on paternal care of the adhesive eggs, gently fanning them with his pectoral fins and even picking them up and moving them to a new location if he feels they are in danger. The eggs should hatch within 3-6 days (temperature dependent) and they remain in a larval state for around 30 days. As soon as the eggs hatch, parental care ceases, so you will need to separate the young from the parents and any other fish in the tank just prior to this event. Raising the larvae to adult fish is possible, but very challenging - you will need a ready supply of miniscule foodstuffs such as rotifers available at all times and water quality/tank hygiene must be continually monitored. The female fish can come off a bit the worse for wear following a spawning event (ripped fins, missing scales etc) so be sure to keep a close eye on water quality to ensure she recovers quickly."

Whilst the shrimp is working, it maintains antennal contact with its goby partner posted at the entrance of the shared burrow. If the shrimp detects the quivering motion of the goby\"\u2122s caudal fin during an unusual situation, it reacts by immediately withdrawing into the depths of the burrow. The entrance to the shared burrow will be closed at night, and only one entrance is usually open at any one time.

The goby will survive without its shrimp partner, but if they can be acquired together, they will make such a fascinating display, captivating the observer for hours on end. Your dealer may be able to acquire the two together, it is certainly worth asking. The Sulphur Goby is a territorial species, and larger specimens will think nothing of attacking other gobies and smaller, unrelated placid fish. However, it is much less likely to be antagonistic if housed in spacious aquaria with plenty of visual barriers (although do remember to include large, open expanses of substrate), and where it is one of the last fishes added to the tank. Hostility normally initially takes the form of jaw gaping, fin flaring, and sideways shoving, but if it is allowed to escalate, real damage may ensue if the goby takes a bite at its adversary, so do observe very carefully. It is best to keep only one specimen per tank unless you can acquire a mated male-female pair, as conspecifics will fight. These gobies are considered reef safe as they will not harm sessile invertebrates, but be aware that they will predate on small, ornamental shrimps and small bristleworms. Ensure that the tank has tight fitting coverslides, as these gobies are accomplished jumpers. May also be seen on sale as the Yellow Shrimp Goby.",

This charming little fish is one of the least aggressive of the dotty back species, and it makes a wonderful addition to reef aquaria where no small ornamental crustaceans are present. Be aware that adults will eat small shrimp, but they will also prey on many invertebrate pests; small fireworms are consumed with relish. The aquarium must be mature and should include ample rockwork, arranged so that there is an abundance of small caves, crevices, channels, and overhangs that provide safe, shady retreats for this species. Sunrise Dottybacks generally mix well with other community-type reef inhabitants, but occasional specimens can be a little territorial (although this is more likely to occur in smaller aquaria where space/hiding places are at a premium). Nevertheless, they should be one of the last species introduced to the tank. Do not house with any large, aggressive species, as the dotty back will be very easily intimidated and may refuse to come out and feed, leading to starvation. If the aquarium is very spacious and has plenty of visual barriers amongst the decor, more than one specimen may be kept together if of the same size and introduced simultaneously. However, if the system is on the smaller side, it really is best to keep just one specimen and not with any easily bullied tankmates. It is essential that the tank has tight fitting cover slides, as Sunrise Dottybacks are expert jumpers. Tank-bred specimens are often available in the trade.",

        "breeding": "This species has been bred in the home aquarium, but raising the young is challenging. When ready to spawn, the male fish will prepare a spawning site - usually a cave and will then lure the female into it, where hundreds of sticky eggs will be laid/fertilized. The male will guard and fan the eggs until they hatch, which is usually between 3 and 7 days, depending on water temperature. The tiny larvae initially feed off their yolk sacs but will require appropriately sized foodstuffs such as rotifers soon after. The larvae will undergo metamorphosis at around 24-28 days after hatching."

These beautiful, multicoloured fish are easy to keep, but a spacious aquarium is a necessity, as they are active, grow large, and are powerful swimmers. Ideally, there will also be plenty of rockwork and a sand substrate that is 3-4\"\u009d deep, to provide resting places for your wrasse. Provide clean, well oxygenated water with areas of fast current. This is a fairly boisterous species that should only be kept alongside fish of similar size and temperament. Sunset Wrasses are protogynous sequential hermaphrodites and there are three primary phases, their colour and size depending on whether they are terminal phase (TP) males, initial phase (IP) males, or females. TP males are also known as \"supermales\" and have pink and green heads with blue/blue-green bodies that are overlaid with thin red vertical lines, and the pectoral fins are yellow on the basal half, blue-black distally. IP males and females are much smaller, and have bright yellow bodies with light red vertical lines. IP males and females have the ability to change into TP males and this switch includes a dramatic change of size and coloration. Once transformed from IP male or female to TP male, the change is permanent. It should be noted that in the aquarium, TP males are particularly territorial. Well-fed specimens should not harm corals, but they will prey on bivalves, brittle stars, crabs, gastropods, sea urchins, shrimps, and small fish.

This fish does best in mature aquaria containing plenty of live rock for the fish to browse on and forage amongst. As with all butterflyfishes, this species demands excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of decent current. Known to be a voracious eater of the pest anemone Aiptasia.",

        "care": "Tanaka's Possum Wrasse is a diminutive reef-dweller known from Indonesia and the Philippines. It is a secretive species and spends much of its time staying close to rocky crevices and the shelter of corals, whilst it searches out small benthic invertebrates to feed on. These delightful fish may vary slightly in colour depending on collection location, but they generally display a beautiful sunset red-orange to burgundy body that is adorned with four thin white vertical bands. There is a large ocellus at the posterior of the dorsal fin, and a small ocellus on the anal fin. The colouration of the ventral fins also resemble large ocelli. Although Tanaka's Possum Wrasse is fairly cryptic, it makes a fascinating addition to reef aquaria where no tiny ornamental shrimp are present. The tank should be mature and furnished with plenty of live rock to provide feeding opportunities and shady hiding places. Keep only one per tank unless the tank is very spacious, in which case a group can be added simultaneously if the fish are all of the same size. If housing a group together, do ensure there is an abundance of nooks and crannies for the fish to hide amongst (allow several shelters per fish) and create some visual barriers amongst the decor. This is a slow-swimming fish that is easily bullied, so tankmates should be of similar size and of a peaceful disposition. Stable and optimal water conditions are required at all times, so a good filtration and maintenance regime is a must. Ensure that the aquarium has tight fitting coverslides with no small gaps in the hood, as these fish are expert jumpers.",

        "care": "The Tangaroa Shrimp Goby is known from clear, coastal and inner reefs on sand and rubble flats at depths from 4-40m (13-131ft). These fish are usually observed in pairs, hovering just a few centimetres above the sandy/rubbly substrate at the entrance to their burrow, which they share with an alpheid (pistol) shrimp. This diminutive bottom-dweller has a beautiful semi-translucent white body with orange spots interspersed with tiny blue-white specks and an elongated anterior dorsal fin ray. Tangaroa Shrimp Gobies are very passive and make a great addition to peaceful reef aquaria. They are best kept in a compatible male-female pair (your supplier may be able to source you a mated pair) but be sure not to simply place two individuals together from different sources, as if it turns out that they are both males, they will fight - especially in smaller aquaria. The tank should be furnished with plenty of live rock and a reasonable depth of sandy substrate (~10cm/4\"), with a good selection of small rubble pieces that vary in size (not too big to be moved), from which a burrow can be created. Tankmates should be small and peaceful, as pugnacious species will intimidate these diminutive bottom dwellers and prevent them from feeding. As with other members of the same genus, this goby forms a symbiotic partnership with an almost blind alpheid shrimp; together they share the safety of a burrow which the shrimp digs/maintains, and the goby keeps watch for predators. Whilst the shrimp is working, it maintains antennal contact with its goby partner posted at the entrance of the shared burrow. If the shrimp detects the quivering motion of the goby\"\u2122s caudal fin during an unusual situation, it reacts by immediately withdrawing into the depths of the burrow, hastily followed by the goby. The entrance to the shared burrow will be closed at night, and only one entrance is usually open at any one time. The shrimp will only emerge from the burrow whilst it can have tactile contact with the goby. A shrimp partner is not strictly necessary, but if they can be acquired together, they will make such a fascinating display, captivating the observer for hours on end. The usual shrimp that partners the Tangaroa Shrimp Goby is the Fine Striped Snapping Shrimp Alpheus ochrostriatus, but it will accept other Alpheus species. Your dealer may be able to acquire the gobies and shrimp together, it is certainly worth asking. Ensure that the tank has tight fitting coverslides as Tangaroa Shrimp Gobies have been know n to jump from open-topped aquaria.",

As with all damsels other than clownfish, dominant fish become male. Social groupings consist of a single territorial male, one or more females and unsexed juvenile fish. In the aquarium a stable group can be created, ideally by mixing individuals of different sizes that duplicate this natural order, or allowing sufficient space for weaker fish to escape serious harassment until a dominant individual develops. Any new humbugs added should be significantly smaller than established ones, duplicating the recruitment of juveniles from the plankton. Expect the male to defend a spawning site vigorously from all intruders apart from females ready to spawn.\n  Their aquarium should be spacious and include plenty of rockwork to break sightlines and create hiding spots; try to aquascape it in such a way as to create several visual barriers as this will help to minimise aggression levels. Although hardy, good filtration is a must and decent water movement will be appreciated. Peaceful tankmates are likely to be killed in all but the largest aquaria.\nHumbugs are an active, interesting species to keep but do need to be kept in a stocking scheme that is well thought out beforehand. Removing them from a well-furnished tank will be extremely difficult at a later stage and adding any new fishes can be extremely challenging.

        "care": "The Tomato Clownfish is known from lagoon reefs and embayments to depths of 12m (39ft). They are closely associated with both the Bubble Anemone (Entacmaea quadricolor) and the Sebae Anemone (Heteractis crispa), that afford them lifelong protection from predators and skin parasites. This is a popular and robust aquarium fish which thrives in mature reef aquaria. A host anemone - some of which can be a little tricky to maintain successfully in captivity - is not strictly necessary for your clownfish as most reef set ups contain plenty of hiding places, no large predatory fish, and sometimes cleaner shrimp/cleaner wrasse. In the absence of an anemone, some clownfish take up residence in what they see as a suitable coral substitute - which may cause them to retract in irritation as the clownfish wallow - but this isn\"\u2122t always the case. Many species of clownfish (including the Tomato) are now captive-raised, so wherever possible the conscientious aquarist should aim to source these hardier specimens for the home aquarium, in turn helping to take pressure off the reefs. This is a colourful species, with a vivid tomato red-orange coloured body and a vertical white stripe behind the eyes. Captive raised fish tend to be slightly darker in colouration when young, but soon turn a bright orange-red. As these fish can be somewhat territorial, keep only one pair per tank, providing them with ample space and plenty of visual barriers amongst the decor. It is also best not to mix this species with other species of clownfish as they will fight. With regards to sexing, all clownfish are born as males. A wild colony may consist of a breeding pair, which cohabit with a few non-reproductive smaller male specimens. When the female dies, the dominant male will change sex and become the female. This is known as protandrous sequential hermaphroditism. In the case of two juvenile specimens in the home aquarium, the larger of the two will become the female. Please be aware that these fish are very sensitive to treatment with copper remedies.",
        "feeding": "Offer a varied diet including meaty items such as Mysis shrimp, krill, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp etc, plus herbivore flakes and greenfoods.",
        "breeding": "Tomato Clownfish have been bred in captivity. Prior to spawning, the male will begin biting at the substrate in increasing frequency and intensity in the hopes of attracting a female. If a ripe female accepts him, she may join him with the substrate biting (although the female does not always do this). The pair will then choose a spawning site, usually a smooth rocky surface such as a flat wall inside a cave, and if a host anemone is present, the spawning site will usually be within close vicinity for protection. Several hundred elliptical red-coloured eggs will be deposited. These adhere to the substrate via fine threads at the ventral pole, and the male will aerate them by fanning them with his pectoral fins whilst guarding against predators. The eggs will hatch after 7-10 days, and the larvae typically settle after another 9 days or so. The tiny fry are left to fend for themselves and should be fed on suitably tiny foodstuffs such as live rotifers, moving on to baby brineshrimp after a few days. It is unlikely that fry will survive the attentions of the other fish in a community reef set-up. Interestingly, the tiny juveniles bear 3 vertical white stripes, but these recede to just one as they mature."

Here these pretty, elongate fish gather in large aggregations, hovering above the substrate amongst the current-swept waters to feed on zooplankton. A mated pair will occupy the same burrow, but if a large shoal is startled or when danger approaches, many individuals will hastily retreat or 'dart' into the same refuge together. The aquarium should be mature and offer plenty of swimming space. There should be ample nooks and crannies amongst the rockwork for the fish to hide in, as well as a fine sand substrate into which they can bury at night or when startled. As an especially gregarious species, it is important that a good sized group (of at least 5 individuals) are kept together, and these should be added to the aquarium simultaneously. Tankmates should be very peaceful as Torpedo 'Gobies' are of a somewhat nervous disposition and will not cope well with boisterous companions; indeed, it is most important that they are not intimidated out of feeding so observe carefully. Anthias, blennies, cardinalfish, dragonets, firefish, gobies, and grammas would all work well. Wherever possible, site the tank in an area that does not receive constant foot traffic, and ensure that all illumination switches on and off gradually rather than suddenly, as these fish are so easily spooked. Due to their fast metabolism (and consequent requirement of food offerings several times per day), decent filtration and areas of brisk water movement are essential. Ensure that the tank has tight fitting coverslides and no escape holes where equipment feeds into the aquarium, as these fish are expert jumpers. May also be seen on sale as the Blackfin Dartfish.",

Adults usually swim solitary or in small harems as they cruise amongst large corals, whereas the smaller juvenile fish stay even closer to the reef and swim with their heads down and dorsal and anal fins held erect, so as to make themselves appear much larger to any predators (when viewed side-on, the fish resembles the face of a bigger fish, largely due to the prominent eyespots). These attractive fish require a spacious, mature aquarium with plenty of live rock to both browse upon and hide amongst, plus a decent sand bed \"ideally 7.5cm (3\") deep or more - in which to bury at night or if startled. No matter how often these fish are offered frozen or dried foods, they will starve in a tank without an abundance of mature rockwork, so it is absolutely essential that this is provided; the fish will prey on the micro-fauna that live amongst the rock, such as tiny shrimps, amphipods, copepods, and small crustaceans, which are easily crushed with its powerful pharyngeal teeth. For this reason, these fish cannot be kept alongside ornamental crustaceans and shrimps, as these items form part of its natural diet. Sessile invertebrates, however, will be perfectly safe. Effective filtration and circulation with a high level of oxygenation are a must in order to maintain optimal water conditions. Tight-fitting coverslides are also essential, as these fish are expert jumpers. Keep only one per tank, unless you can acquire a mated pair or a harem that consists of just one male and several females; the latter two options requiring a vast aquarium. Tankmates should be aggressive; if the wrasse is kept alongside large angels or tangs, it will become much more reclusive. Not to be kept alongside any of the dragon species, as they will be outcompeted for food by the wrasse.

Here this species usually occurs in pairs and together they excavate a shallow burrow from bits of rubble and use this as a safe refuge. A large mature reef aquarium with a deep sand bed and a well-established refugium are essential for this species, which is recommended for advanced aquarists only. Twostripe Gobies like to dig burrows underneath rocks and coral bases, so be sure that any structures are secure, and that there is a good depth of (live) sand in most parts of the aquarium. This will not only enable them to create a burrow, but is also a vital lifeline for them as they sift through this substrate in search for tiny invertebrate food items. The sand is taken in through the mouth, the food items swallowed, and the remaining sand expelled through the gills. These fish are not overly particular where they dump the sand they have sifted, and as it is usually expelled whilst the fish are in motion, it can sometimes end up dropping down onto and swamping prized corals. For this reason, they are not always a welcome addition to aquaria containing delicate coral life, and careful planning is needed. However, if their requirements can be met, it must be said that these fish do a remarkably good job of overturning the substrate and keeping it looking fresh. Wherever possible, this is a species that should be maintained in a compatible pair. Twostripe Gobies should not be kept alongside other members of the Valenciennea genus as they will quarrel. The most significant and diagnostic characteristic for this species is the presence of a pair of parallel lines running horizontally across the length of  the body. Both of these stripes are black to burgundy in colour, with the uppermost stripe starting just above the upper lip, running through the eye, continuing horizontally lengthways and ending at the posterior of the caudal fin. The lower stripe begins at the base of the upper lip, and runs parallel with the upper stripe, also to the posterior of the caudal fin. In fact, the two stripes extend to just outside of the caudal fin margin, forming small filamentous extensions, a trait which is unique to this species. Capable of jumping from open topped aquaria.

        "care": "A fish of understated beauty, the Vampire Tang is known to inhabit tropical lagoons, seaward reefs, and silty inshore atolls, where it grazes on benthic algae either singly or in small shoals. They are typically observed between 1 and 20 metres deep. Juvenile fish sport a dark horseshoe-shaped mark on the shoulders, which separates into two bold horizontal curved bands as the fish mature. The caudal spine is encircled with black and then again with a vibrant bright blue. The posterior edge of the caudal fin also develops the same electric blue colouration. Due to an active nature and moderate adult size, Vampire Tangs require good sized aquaria with vigorous filtration and plenty of water movement and oxygenation. These fish are generally safe in the reef aquarium, providing they are well fed. A mature tank is necessary to help ensure that your Vampire Tang settles in well; in particular these fish enjoy grazing upon filamentous algae growing upon the decor. Arrange the live rock to create a sloping reef, with plenty of boltholes for the fish, should they feel the need to dash for cover at any time. Keep only one per tank, and not with any other Acanthurus species or direct food competitors, as these fish can be highly territorial. In very large aquaria, it is possible to maintain these fish alongside Tangs of other genera such as Ctenochaetus, Naso, and Zebrasoma \u201c but ideally they should be of a similar size and added simultaneously. However, personalities do vary between individuals, so observe your fish very carefully to ensure that there are no problems. Take care when handling, as the caudal spines can inflict a painful wound.",
        "feeding": "Feed a varied diet for omnivores, with a large vegetable component, in small amounts 3 times per day. Although this species will browse on algae within the aquarium, its diet must be supplemented with frozen herbivore rations, green marine flake, Spirulina (blue-green algae), Spirulina-enriched brineshrimp, cucumber, lettuce, broccoli, Nori (dried seaweed) etc. It will also take meaty frozen foods, but be sure that it is receiving enough green food to help prevent HLLE.

Often solitary outside of the breeding season, they rest during the daytime, habitually assuming an immobile head down position. By night, they hunt small fishes, shrimps, and crabs, spreading their pectoral fins wide to herd and trap the prey in a corner, swallowing it whole in one lightning quick mouthful. This fish is a popular, bold, and long-lived aquarium resident, spending a lot of its time on view in the open. It will frequently hover in open water in anticipation of feeding time. As the Volitans Lionfish can attain a large adult size, it requires a spacious aquarium from the outset. Tankmates must be chosen with care on account of the natural diet - never attempt to house with small fishes, shrimps, or crabs. In very large quarters, this species may be kept in good-sized groups of its own kind, if all specimens are of the same size and introduced simultaneously. However, personalities do vary and we would advise careful observation and a means of separating the fish should it become necessary. It is not advisable to try and keep this species with different species of lionfish due to aggression levels.

Juvenile fish are typically found openly on the reef, looking very much like nudibranchs, whereas adults are closely associated with sponges and soft corals. These strange-looking fish are found in relatively shallow waters with a maximum depth of 15m (49ft). Capable of dramatic colour change, the benthic Warty Frogfish uses this extraordinary camouflage technique to blend effortlessly into its surroundings, and depending where it is resting, may appear white, cream, yellow, orange, brown, or black, with blotches/saddles of contrasting colour (usually rusty-red or pink). This is a solitary species which is most often found sitting virtually immobile in prominent perches amongst sponges or soft corals, sporadically waving its esca (lure) and instantly ambushing  any passing small fishes that are attracted by this bait. The esca is the shape of a very small fish or shrimp, and is attached to the front of the face via a long, thin illicium (a thread-like, modified first dorsal spine). The Warty Frogfish makes a wonderful aquarium inhabitant, although unfortunately it cannot be considered completely reef-safe, due to its propensity to eat ornamental shrimp, small crabs, and small fishes - even those that are of similar body length to that of the frogfish. However, it can be kept alongside most corals and sponges fairly safely. If tankmates are desired, ensure that they are not small enough to be eaten, and also make sure they are not kept alongside any boisterous fish or those that may not be able to resist picking at the sponge-like, 'warty'-skinned body (e.g. large angelfish etc). There should be plenty of perches created with the live rockwork, and ideally areas with sponges, soft corals, and algaes that the fish can rest amongst. Be aware that although this species does not grow to a huge size, it is predatory from an early age and will take fishes the same size as itself or smaller. It is best fed on live grass shrimp and slowly weaned onto frozen fare. The marking that diverts to the posterior edge of the eye distinguishes this species from the similar A. pictus. May also be seen on sale as the Wartskin Frogfish or Warty Anglerfish.",

The angelfish from the genus Genicanthus are unusual in that they are not classed as true dwarf angels, yet they remain relatively small sized fish. They also display a remarkable sexual dimorphism. This particular species is ideal for the deepwater reef aquarium with lots of shady overhangs and crevices amongst the live rock. Although it does not grow to a huge size, Watanabe's Angelfish is a very active species that does require a good amount of space. Keep either singly, as a male-female pair, or one male with a harem of several females, but never house a male G. watanabei with another male or with any other members of the Genicanthus genus - especially those of similar appearance. Will usually ignore some of the more placid species of dwarf angelfish from the Centropyge genus, but as each fish is an individual and behaviour is certainly not set in stone, do observe very carefully. These fish have been known to pick on small planktivores such as wreckfish (Pseudanthias spp.), fairy and flasher wrasses, and fire fish, but they are perfectly safe with soft and stony corals. Good water movement is essential, and plenty of live rock will be appreciated for shelter/grazing (plenty of dimly lit areas will also help with the settling in period). Watanabe's Angelfish generally adapt very well to life in captivity, accepting aquarium fare and acclimatising to the conditions found in a well-maintained tank.

Here, these fascinating bottom dwellers occur either singly or in pairs, and may be observed industriously sifting mouthfuls of sand in order to feed on the small invertebrates, organic matter, and algae contained within. A large mature reef aquarium with a deep sand bed and a well-established refugium are essential for this species. Watchman Gobies like to dig burrows underneath rocks and coral bases, so be sure that any structures are secure, and that there is a good depth of (live) sand in most parts of the aquarium. This will not only enable them to create a burrow, but is also a vital lifeline for them as they sift through this substrate in their ongoing search for tiny food items. The sand is taken in through the mouth, the food items swallowed, and the remaining sand is expelled through the gills. These fish are not overly particular where they dump the sand they have sifted, and as it is usually expelled whilst the fish are in motion, it can sometimes end up dropping down onto and swamping prized corals. For this reason, they are not always a welcome addition to aquaria containing delicate coral life, and careful planning is needed. However, if their requirements can be met, it must be said that these fish do a remarkably good job of overturning the substrate and keeping it looking fresh. The Watchman Goby can be a rather territorial towards conspecifics, so it is best maintained singly, unless a compatible male-female pair can be acquired. Tankmates should be of similar size and peaceful temperament. Avoid housing alongside dottybacks and hawkfishes, which may behave rather pugnaciously towards these gobies. Capable of jumping from open aquaria, so do ensure that the tank has tight fitting covers. May also be seen on sale as the Brownbarred Goby or Whitebarred Goby.",
        "feeding": "This species gains the vast majority of its food through sifting the contents of large established sand beds for tiny invertebrates and algae, and may starve to death in tanks without a mature, live sand substrate. The diet should also be supplemented with small sized meaty frozen foods such as Mysis shrimp and Spirulina/vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, along with herbivore rations. Offer small amounts of food several times per day, target feeding if necessary.",
        "breeding": "In the wild, these fish form monogamous pairs, and the onset of spawning is synchronous with semi-lunar phases. This species has spawned in the home aquarium, but raising the microscopic larvae is extremely challenging. The male will construct a suitable burrow and will entice the female to spawn inside. Once the egg mass has been laid/fertilised, the male drives off the female and guards the cave until the eggs hatch, which is usually at around 72-96 hours (temperature dependent). The resultant larvae are just under 3mm in length and will require feedings of miniscule foodstuffs such as live rotifers. It is unlikely that the young will survive the attentions of the other fish in a community reef set-up."

        "care": "This large, characterful pufferfish species is known from lagoons, coastal bays, and inner reef flats where there are sandy stretches with rubble and sparse seagrass, at depths of between 3 and 50 metres. Juveniles are often associated with weedy areas of estuaries where there is ample cover for them to develop in relative safety. Adults are usually solitary and fairly territorial. They typically feed on various types of algae (including coralline), mollusks, crabs, tunicates, sponges, corals, zoanthids, tube worms, and echinoderms; feeding on hard prey keeps the beak from overgrowing. Therefore due to such eating habits, these fish are not suitable for keeping in a reef setting in the home aquarium. As Whitespotted Pufferfish tend to attain quite a size, a very large tank will be needed to house an adult specimen. Despite its eventual size, this species is relatively gentle for a puffer, although it must still be considered a semi-aggressive fish. Keep only one per tank and not with any other pufferfish; ideally, tankmates will be of similar size and temperament. The aquarium should be aquascaped with plenty of rockwork, with some large-sized shelters, and an open swimming space along the front. Filtration must be efficient to cope with the voracious eating habits and large amounts of waste that these fish produce, yet water movement should not be too vigorous. Be aware that large pufferfish are notorious for biting through tubing, and even heaters, so it is worth thinking very carefully about where you place your equipment; do also always keep a close eye on where the fish is when carrying out any maintenance in the tank. The general coloration of the White-spotted Pufferfish is an overall grey-brown, with the back, sides, and caudal fin speckled with white spots. The belly area is marked with white stripes. These markings lend themselves to the alternative common name of the Stars and Stripes Puffer. As the fish mature, the white spots appear smaller in proportion to the rest of the fish. When frightened, these fish can inflate themselves to more than twice their original size to deter predators. This defense mechanism is a last resort, and should never be actively encouraged; it is particularly dangerous if the fish ingests air instead of water. Kept in the right conditions, the Whitespotted Puffer will become a real \"pet fish\" with bags of personality, soon learning to recognize its owner and beg for food. Just don't be tempted to feed directly from your hand always add food a safe distance away, or with tongs!",
        "feeding": "Offer a varied diet consisting mainly of meaty items such as vitamin-enriched krill, prawns, cockle, mussel, whitebait, squid, and clam meat. Hard-shelled foods such as cockle-in-shell and crab legs should be given regularly to help keep the beak worn down. A decent amount of living in the tank will also give the puffer lots of browsing opportunities which will also help to keep the beak in check.",
        "breeding": "This species has not been bred in the home aquarium. Little is known about its reproductive habits other than the fact that the male fish digs a nest into the sandy substrate and entices a female there to spawn."

Here these beautiful fish are found in impressive sized shoals, feeding on filamentous and calcareous algae. The fish pictured here is a juvenile; adult fish are very deep bodied (but still laterally compressed) and sport a dark grey body with two vertical silver stripes towards the anterior, with the posterior half dotted with many white spots, these becoming smaller and more numerous with age. The pelvic fins are a contrasting bright yellow colour, and the tail takes on a similar hue as the fish mature. This semi-aggressive, active species attains a good size and can be rather territorial, so a spacious aquarium is therefore required. It is usually best to keep only one per tank, unless the system is vast and there is an abundance of visual barriers. If you wish to keep other tangs in the same tank, it is best to opt for Ctenochaetus, Naso, or Zebrasoma species - added simultaneously - as these will be best tolerated by the Whitespotted Tang, rather than other fish from the same genus (Acanthurus). However, personalities do vary between individuals, so observe your fish very carefully to ensure that there are no problems. Generally speaking, this fish is safe in reef aquaria, although occasional specimens have been known to nip at LPS corals if underfed. The Whitespotted Tang will actively browse on filamentous algae growing on the d\u00c3\u00a9cor, so a mature tank is essential for its wellbeing. Arrange the live rock to create a sloping reef, with plenty of boltholes for the fish, also being sure to leave a large open swimming area along the front of the aquarium. Vigorous filtration and circulation is a must for this energetic, voracious eater. May also be seen on sale as Mustard Tang, Mustard Guttatus Tang, Spotband Tang, or Spotted Tang.",
        "feeding": "Feed a varied diet, consisting mainly of vegetable matter, in small amounts 3 times per day. Although this species will browse on algae within the aquarium, its diet must be supplemented with frozen herbivore rations, green marine flake, Spirulina (blue-green algae), Spirulina-enriched brineshrimp, cucumber, lettuce, broccoli, Nori (dried seaweed) etc. It will also take small meaty frozen foods as an occasional treat. Adding a specially formulated vitamin supplement to any frozen foods will be beneficial.",
        "breeding": "The Whitespotted Tang has not been bred in the home aquarium. In the wild, this species has been observed spawning year round, usually in or adjacent to the outlet channel of reef flats where water currents flow in a seaward direction.

Male fish are very territorial and form a harem with a large number of females. In the confines of the aquarium, it is best to keep either a solitary specimen, or else a group comprising of a single male and at least 8 females. Unfortunately, smaller groups will result in squabbles, where the weakest fish is likely to be picked on and prevented from feeding, eventually succumbing to being bullied by the others. These large shoals should only be considered if the tank is of XXL proportions \" if the tank is of average size, it really is best to house a single specimen only. The Wreck Fish is a species of relatively boisterous disposition and so should not be housed with other members of the genus, with direct food competitors (zooplankton feeders) or docile species such as firefish; on the other hand, ensure that their tankmates are not overly large, belligerent species either or the Wreck Fish may feel intimidated. They are usually perfectly safe in a reef set up, typically swimming out and about in the open water areas and ignoring sessile invertebrates. A varied diet is a must to keep the fish in good health and for them to display their vibrant colouration. Ideally they will be fed small amounts several times per day (see below). Powerful filtration and protein skimming, plus a good maintenance regime are essential for maintaining optimal water quality despite the heavy nutrient input. As these fish inhabit areas of great tidal surge in the wild, they require vigorous water movement in the home aquarium - a high level of oxygenation at all times being of utmost importance. It should be noted that the colour of male fish can vary greatly from one geographical location to the next. May also be seen on sale as Indian Ocean Wreckfish or Lyretail Anthias.",
        "feeding": "In the wild, this species is constantly on the lookout for food, taking zooplankton from the water column.

        "care": "In the wild, Yellow Boxfish inhabit lagoons and semi-sheltered seaward reefs, with juvenile fish living cryptically amongst Acropora corals. These solitary fish are considered relatively poor swimmers and for this reason, developed protection via toxin release. Unfortunately, keeping YellowBoxfish in the home aquarium is very risky. This is a species notorious for readily excreting the poison ostracitoxin when stressed - a deadly toxin that is capable of wiping out an entire tank. Never keep more than one in the same tank as bickering and subsequent ostracitoxin release is very likely to occur. If tankmates are desired, they must be peaceful so as not to harass the boxfish; however, their continued safety will be precarious, hence why an aspecies-only set up is highly recommended. These fish have impressive teeth which are used to scrape algae (containing various microorganisms) tunicates and sponges off of rocks, and this forms the bulk of the diet along with various bivalves, snails, polychaete worms, mollusks, foraminiferans, and small fishes. For this reason, Yellow Boxfish are not suited to reef tanks, although there should be some live rock in the tank to provide welcome shelters and grazing opportunities. The tank must be very spacious and a large open swimming area should be provided so that the boxfish is able to swim out and about during daylight hours when usually they are at their most active. Despite their less-than-nimble method of locomotion, Yellow Boxfish is capable of jumping from open-topped tanks, so tight-fitting coverslides are a must. Care must be taken when carrying out maintenance on the aquarium, so as to keep the fish as calm as possible. Ideally, the tank will be situated where there is as little traffic going past as possible. Lights should turn on and off very gradually via the use of a dimmer - sudden bright light can shock the boxfish into toxin release. All foods should be offered towards the bottom of the tank to avoid the boxfish drawing in air when trying to take food from the surface. Boxfish have very small mouths and stomachs and it is of extreme importance that they are fed small amounts throughout the day to prevent starvation(something which may not always be immediately apparent because of the rigid bony plates along the sides of the boxfish). On account of this feeding regime, highly efficient filtration and protein skimming is a must. Juveniles (as pictured above) are bright yellow with black spots; but as the fish grows, the spots disappear and the fish takes on a blue-grey appearance with patches of subdued yellow. Although many an aquarist has been charmed by colourful young boxfish with their engaging, curious personalities, and somewhat cute method of locomotion, these fish are not suitable for beginners.",
        "feeding": "An omnivorous species that should be offered small meaty frozen foods such as Mysis shrimp, Spirulinaenriched brineshrimp, chopped prawns/krill/mussel/cockle/clam/squid etc as well as herbivore foods including marine algae. Floating foods are not recommended as the fish may ingest air. Feed small amounts several times per day.",

Here this coral-commensal goby is found singly or in pairs, amongst branches of Acropora. These fish are characterised by a uniform bright yellow body colour and an absence of scales. The modified ventral fins have fused to form a kind of suction cup that helps them to maintain position on coral branches in swift currents. Yellow Coral Gobies are generally of a peaceful nature and make a wonderful addition to mature reef aquaria containing established colonies of broad-branching SPS corals, which they very much enjoy hiding amongst. Although often recommended for nano aquaria because of its diminutive size, caution should be exercised for two reasons. Firstly, smaller tanks will limit the number of individuals you can keep together; only one specimen is recommended in small nano type tanks, otherwise there will be constant arguments over territory which could result in the untimely demise of the weaker individual. Secondly, the more space available in a reef setting, the chances are that there will be much larger, stable colonies of suitable SPS corals available, and so it is less likely that these fish will damage any one individual beyond repair as they go about their daily routines (hiding/resting amongst the branches, and feeding on the occasional mucous polyp). If these types of corals are not being cultivated in your aquarium, invest in several coral skeletons so that these fish have something natural to interact with and give them a sense of security. Yellow Coral Gobies may be kept in groups (but only in larger quarters where there is an abundance of hiding places/territories), and oftentimes these fish will pair up and spawn. With regards to tankmates, these should all be small, non-aggressive feeders. These gobies actually produce a thick toxic body slime that deters many species from trying to consume them. Having said that, obviously do not house these fish with large carnivores. May also be seen on sale as the Yellow Clown Goby.",

These fish are bi-directional protogynous hermaphrodites (which is sometimes referred to as a bi-directional sex change), which is an uncommon trait among gobies, meaning that any two fish placed together are guaranteed to form a male-female pair. These fish tend to strip a small area of coral polyps in order to create a place to deposit their eggs, although other sites are not unheard of. The male fish will dance/quiver in front of the female and when she is ready to spawn, she will deposit her eggs on the coral branch, and these are immediately fertilised and subsequently guarded by the male. The eggs are very small (less than 1mm in diameter) and can number several hundred. The presence of the eggs on the coral may cause a small amount of tissue recession in that area, but this should recover quickly once the eggs have hatched (4-5 days, dependent on water temperature). The larvae are miniscule and require appropriately sized foodstuffs such as cultured rotifers and copepods."

It should be provided with a spacious aquarium, as ample swimming space is required - specimens kept in smaller quarters can become quite aggressive. In very large aquaria, it is possible to maintain a group of Yellow Tangs (7+ is best), but they must be introduced simultaneously and any bullied individuals will need to be removed. Other tangs from different genera (such as the Regal tang or Yellow eye tang) will usually be accepted after initial squabbles to determine hierarchy and mixed-species groups of tangs are generally much easier to put together. The tank should be mature with plenty of algal growth for these herbivores to browse.  As long as this fish is kept well fed, it should not pose any problems in a reef set up. Occasional specimens have been known to nip at stony corals, and even some soft corals, but this is not the norm. A decent current/highly oxygenated conditions will serve this fish well and helps these active fishes burn off energy. Provide plenty of hiding/sleeping places amongst the rockwork, with an open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. At night time, the yellow colour fades slightly, and a horizontal white blotch appears along the flanks. May also be seen on sale as the Yellow Sailfin Tang.\nLegislation banning Hawaiian exports has unfortunately had a massive impact on the availability and price of this fish, as this established sustainable fishery has been the primary source of specimens for some years. Now that the market price will increase, we can expect to see increasing interest in captive bred fishes.

Adult fish may be seen in pairs or small aggregations, to depths of 40m (131ft). Here they may be observed feeding on coral fragments, filamentous algae, polychaetes, small crustaceans, and sponges. A good-sized, mature system is requisite, along with ample live rock for the fish to browse upon/hide amongst and a large open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Medium sized specimens tend to acclimatise better to aquarium life, adapting much more quickly to various prepared foods, so try to choose a healthy, alert specimen around 9cm (3.5\") in length. Smaller sized fish may be very reluctant to feed, and larger specimens can sometimes be rather finicky, requiring faultless water conditions. An aquarium that has some areas of lush filamentous algae growth will also aid your new fish in settling into its new surroundings; however, as with other butterflyfish species, these fish demand excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of brisk current. Some aquarists have successfully kept the Yellow Teardrop Butterflyfish alongside some of the more noxious soft corals, but this is something of a risk, and they should be observed carefully. Stony corals and many other sessile invertebrates will be constantly nipped at, so unfortunately must be avoided. Keep only one Yellow Teardrop Butterflyfish per tank (unless a mated pair is acquired) and not with any other butterflyfish as they will squabble over territories. Whilst they can be rather shy when first introduced, providing them with ample retreats amongst the live rock should ensure they eventually gain confidence and venture out into the open much more. Tankmates should be of similar size and temperament; it is imperative that boisterous companions are avoided if this fish is to settle in and feed. There are two different butterflyfish species commonly known as 'teardrop butterflyfish', C. interruptus that is featured here, and C. unimaculatus. At one time, these two fish were considered regional variations of the same species (C. unimaculatus), but they have significant colour differences and their natural ranges do not overlap, so they are now considered two separate species.",

Adults are usually solitary and spend much time grazing on algae and the microfauna living in the algae. Although attaining a moderate size, this is not a particularly aggressive species and it should get on well with most tankmates - the exceptions being others of its own kind and close relatives. For this reason, keep only one specimen per tank, and not with any other tangs. The aquarium should be spacious, mature, and aquascaped with plenty of live rock. High water quality and areas of powerful flow are essential. A healthy growth of microalgae will be extremely beneficial as this lively herbivore spends a large part of the day grazing with its flexible comb-like teeth. It is important that this fish receives a generous amount of vegetable matter in its diet in order to help prevent head and lateral line erosion. The Yellow-eyed Tang may also be seen on sale as the Kole Tang. These fish display an orange-brown body colour with thin, light horizontal stripes on the flanks and fine spotting on the head area. Another closely related species, the Indian Ocean Yellow Eyed Tang (A. truncatus) is very similar in appearance; it has the same body colour but the whole body is covered in fine spotting with no lines.

This is a fairly delicate species that is suitable for advanced aquarists only. In the confines of the aquarium, it is best to keep either a solitary specimen or else a group comprising of a single male and at least 8 females. Unfortunately, smaller groups will result in squabbles, where the weakest fish is likely to be picked on and prevented from feeding, eventually succumbing to being bullied by the others.

YellowbackAnthias are relatively peaceable. They should not be housed with direct food competitors or with docile species such as firefish. Conversely, ensure that their tankmates are not overly large, belligerent species either, or the Yellowback Anthias will feel intimidated. Many have found that these fish do best when introduced into a tank that already contains a well-established shoal of less-aggressive anthias species, as this helps to stimulate the feeding response and facilitates their own acclimatization. Yellowback Anthias are usually perfectly safe in a mature reef setup, typically swimming out and about in the open water areas and ignoring sessile invertebrates. A varied diet is a must to keep the fish in good health and for them to display their vibrant colouration. Ideally, they will be fed small amounts several times per day (see below). An attached refugium cultivating copepods and amphipods can also really help to provide a steady, ongoing supply of nutritious live food to keep this active planktivore content. Powerful filtration and protein skimming, plus a good maintenance regime are essential for maintaining optimal water quality despite the heavy nutrient input.

Keep only one per tank unless the tank is very spacious, in which case a group can be added simultaneously if the fish are all of the same size. If housing a group together, do ensure there is an abundance of nooks and crannies for the fish to hide amongst (allow several shelters per fish) and create some visual barriers amongst the decor. This is a slow-swimming fish that is easily bullied, so tankmates should be of similar size and of a peaceful disposition. Stable and optimal water conditions are required at all times, so a good filtration and maintenance regime is a must. Ensure that the aquarium has tight fitting coverslides with no small gaps in the hood, as these fish are expert jumpers.",
        "feeding": "This species will spend many hours searching out micro-invertebrates living in amongst the live rock and substrate. It must be provided with natural prey, and a constant supply of tiny live foods for this purpose can be cultured in a fishless refugium. Will also enjoy vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, cyclops, baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii), and Mysis. Some specimens will also take flake food.",
        "breeding": "The Yellowbanded Possum Wrasse has not been bred in the home aquarium, although some aquarists have observed courtship behaviour."

        "care": "The Yellowhead Angelfish is known from coral and rubble areas of outer reef slopes, to depths of 70m (230ft). This pygmy angelfish is encountered only around the Cocos (Keeling) and Christmas Islands and is most commonly observed in small harems usually consisting of one dominant male, up to 5 mature females, and several juveniles. This rare export requires a mature aquarium with plenty of live rockwork, on which it can graze for the microalgae, and in which it can hide. Unfortunately, like many other dwarf angelfish, this species is known to occasionally pick on zoanthids and LPS corals so caution is advised when adding to a reef set up; the larger the tank, the better, as the fish is then less likely to continually pick at any particular sessile invertebrate and cause irreparable damage. A frequent, varied feeding regime will also help in this respect. Like most other members of the Centropyge genus, the Yellowhead Angelfish does not grow very large, but nevertheless, it is an active species which requires plenty of space. Unless the aquarium is of XL proportions, only one specimen should be housed per tank, and not with any other Centropyge species. If the aquarium is spacious enough, it is possible to keep a compatible male-female pair if they are added simultaneously. However, this should only ever be attempted by advanced aquarists who have the means to separate the fish if a problem arises. Good filtration, along with decent water movement to generate high levels of oxygenation, are a must. This is a territorial species that will behave pugnaciously when newcomers are added to the tank after it has become established (particularly small placid fish) and so we advise that when planning on including a Yellowhead Angelfish in your stock list, it should be the last fish that is added to the aquarium. Juvenile fish sport a very bright ocellus on the posterior of the dorsal fin, just above the caudal peduncle, a tactic used to confuse predators. The adult colour pattern is similar to that of its relative, the Bicolor Angelfish (C. bicolor), although the Yellowhead is comparatively much hardier once acclimatised; the main downside being only the high price tag it tends to command. May also be seen on sale as the Cocos Islands Pygmy Angelfish or Joculator Angelfish.",
        "feeding": "Should be offered a varied diet including Spirulina & marine algae as well as meaty fare such as vitamin/Spirulina-enriched brineshrimp, Mysis shrimp, special sponge-based Angelfish preparations, and finely chopped krill/squid/cockle/mussel. Feed small amounts at least 3 times per day. Fish that are well-fed are more likely to leave invertebrate life alone.",
        "breeding": "Occasional spawnings have been reported in the home aquarium, although there are no reports of successfully rearing the young once the eggs have hatched. Dwarf angelfish are broadcast spawners, releasing eggs and milt simultaneously into the water column at dusk. There are reports of this species being successfully bred on a commercial basis."

        "care": "The Yellowhead Butterflyfish is known from the tropical waters of the East African coast, eastwards to Sri Lanka, and over to the Maldives, western Thailand, and north-western Sumatra. These fish are usually solitary, but are occasionally seen forming small, loose aggregations (5-6 individuals) around isolated coral heads and algae-rich rocky reefs, where they may be observed feeding on coral polyps and benthic algae, to depths of 30m (98ft). This species is regarded as moderately difficult, and is therefore recommended for advanced aquarists only. A large, mature system is requisite, along with ample live rock for the fish to browse upon/hide amongst and a large open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Medium sized specimens tend to acclimatise better to aquarium life, adapting much more quickly to various prepared foods, so try and choose a healthy, alert specimen around 10cm (4\") in length. Smaller sized fish may be reluctant to feed, and larger specimens can be very finicky, requiring significant space and faultless water conditions. An aquarium that has some areas of lush filamentous algae growth will also aid your new fish in settling into its new surroundings; however, as with other butterflyfish species, these fish demand excellent water quality - thoroughly filtered and well oxygenated, with areas of brisk current. Some aquarists have successfully kept Yellowhead Butterflyfish alongside some of the more noxious soft corals, but this is something of a risk, and they should be observed carefully. Stony corals and other sessile invertebrates will be constantly nipped at, so unfortunately must be avoided. Keep only one Yellowhead Butterflyfish per tank and do not house with any other butterflyfish as they will squabble over territories. Whilst they can be a little shy when first introduced, providing them with ample retreats amongst the live rock will ensure they quickly gain confidence and venture out into the open. Once settled, these peaceful fish actually become very assertive feeders and will compete with most other fish species. In the wild, natural hybrids with the Saddled Butterflyfish (C. ephippium) have been observed where their ranges overlap. May also be seen on sale as Goldhead/Goldheaded Butterflyfish, Goldring Butterflyfish, or Yellowheaded Butterflyfish.",
        "feeding": "Feed small amounts several times per day, and be sure to offer a good variety of different foods. Frozen fare such as Mysis shrimp, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, finely chopped clam/mussel/cockle/crab/shrimp/squid etc. can be proffered, but - most importantly \"\u201c do ensure that the larger foodstuffs are chopped into small enough pieces on account of butterflyfish having tiny mouths.",

These fish need a mixed substrate that is at least 10cm (3.9\") deep. Ideally this will be comprised of 75% coral sand, and 25% small pieces of reef rubble (varying from approx. 0.5cm to 1.5cm in diameter). This will allow to the fish to construct a burrow, in which it will spend much time hovering just near the entrance, continuously rearranging things around and within its little tunnel. At night they sometimes close the entrance of the burrow with a larger pebble as they reverse in. The aquarium must have a tight fitting cover, as these fish will jump, and lighting should always be turned on gradually so as not to startle your fish. Their constant excavation and digging means that powerful filtration and water movement is prerequisite. Yellowhead Jawfish may be kept in small groups; in fact they often do better this way, but do ensure that there is adequate space for them all to construct their homes (in the wild they may live as close as 30cm to one another). Ideally all will be introduced at the same time to eliminate any territorial issues. Tankmates should be small and docile.",

        "breeding": "This species has been bred in captivity, but reports are few and far between. Courting and spawning is said to occur at dusk or dawn. Yellowhead Jawfish are paternal mouthbrooders, meaning that the male fish incubates the eggs. These should hatch within 7-9 days. A ready supply of tiny planktonic foodstuffs will be required. Amazingly, young fish start digging their tiny burrows at just 3-4 weeks of age."

Ideally, there will also be plenty of rockwork and a sandy substrate, along with clean, well oxygenated water incorporating areas of fast current.

Here, this elongate bottom-dweller may be found in the narrow nooks and crannies between rocks and corals, at a maximum depth of 50m (164ft). It typically feeds overnight, with xanthid crabs making up the bulk of the diet, but will also take other crustaceans, molluscs, and urchins. Close-set, pebble-like teeth enable these eels to crush hard-shelled prey with ease. The aquarium should be spacious and mature, with a soft sandy substrate. Create plenty of narrow, shady refuges in the rockwork that the eel can explore and hide amongst, ensuring that all decor is stable and cannot be undermined. Suitable crevices should have a fairly narrow entrance hole but be roomy enough behind for the eel to conceal its entire body within. Unfortunately, this fish is not recommended for reef aquaria, as although small fish are rarely taken, ornamental invertebrates will be eaten without exception, and corals which are not securely attached to the rockwork may be accidentally toppled. The Zebra Eel grows large and is a voracious eater, so ensure that the filtration/protein skimming is very efficient, with areas of brisk water movement and some calmer resting spots out of the current. This fish is relatively mild-mannered and reclusive, but it can become more pugnacious at feeding times. Conspecifics are not well tolerated, so it is best to maintain just one Zebra Eel per tank. Companions can include many medium-large sized fish that thrive in a fish-only set up. Ensure that the aquarium has tight fitting coverslides and no gaps where equipment feeds into the tank, as these fish are proficient escape artists.

As adults, these shoaling fish gather in numbers to feed on the abundance of zooplankton that the currents deliver. Hemitaurichthys is an often overlooked genus, containing 4 known species. It is a shame that they are not seen more often in the trade, as these are relatively hardy fish that acclimatize well to aquarium life, and if well fed, they usually pose no problems in reef aquaria that house some of the more noxious soft corals. A number of aquarists have even found them to be completely reef-safe, but as with such matters, \"your mileage may vary\", and we would recommend exercising caution and careful observation. Zoster Butterflyfish grow reasonably large and are an active species, so a spacious aquarium that allows room for both ample live rock and a decent swimming space along the front of the tank is requisite. Ideally, these peaceful species will be maintained in small groups, as it prefer to live in aggregations - intraspecific aggression should not be an issue here. It is best to try and obtain medium-sized specimens of between 7.5 and 12.5cm in length,as these always adapt to aquarium life much more readily than those that are very small or very large. If planning on adding a group (and this is best for their long-term well-being), try to obtain specimens that are all of roughly equal sizes, and add all to the tank simultaneously. They should be the only butterflyfish species in the aquarium, and if at all possible, tankmates should be of similar size and temperament. Any fish that could be considered as mildly aggressive should be added after the Zoster Butterflyfish have established their territories, and only if the tank offers sufficient space and ample visual barriers amongst the rockwork. Never try to house these fish with boisterous feeders as they are likely to intimidate the butterflies at feeding time. Ensure that the water is thoroughly filtered and well-oxygenated, and provide areas of brisk current. As with all butterflyfishes, they are always going to be much less likely to pick on coral sand other invertebrates if they are well fed and given plenty of space and distractions. This species is also known as the Black Pyramid Butterflyfish or Brown & White Butterflyfish. The intensity of the brown-black areas on this fish can vary depending on the mood, time of day etc. It is replaced by the yellow and white Pyramid Butterflyfish (H.polylepsis) at Christmas and Cocos-Keeling Islands.",
