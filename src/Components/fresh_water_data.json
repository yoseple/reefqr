        "care": "Adolfo's Cory is an eye-catching, sought-after species, that is ideally suited to smaller softwater aquaria. The substrate should consist of soft sand in order to protect the delicate barbel area, and plenty of shady hiding spots amongst bogwood/plants should be incorporated. As a sociable species, Hoplisoma adolfoi must be kept in groups of 5 or more. The aquarium should be well mature before this species is added and frequent partial water changes are a must, as they can be very sensitive to elevated nitrate levels. Large shoals of small midwater \"dither fish\" will encourage C. adolfoi out into view. Other peaceful species such as some of the smaller fish from the tetra, pencilfish and rasbora families make ideal tankmates. Corydoras have the ability to breathe air intestinally, so a small gap should be left between the surface of the water and the cover slides in order for the fish to come up to the surface and take air in. It may do this numerous times per day.\nSimilar in appearance to C. imitator, which possesses a longer snout. H. duplicareus and H. burgessi also bear a close resemblance and many fishes sold as 'adolfoi' are the more heavily marked duplicareus. \n  Hoplisoma was recently split from Corydoras and contains many familiar species.",

        "breeding": "This species is said to be a little more difficult to breed than other members of the genus, as it can be difficult to raise the fry which are often reluctant to start feeding. In the wild these fish scatter their eggs in dense vegetation, so provide plenty of fine leaved plants. A cooler water change, as with many species of Corydoras, may trigger your fish into spawning in the classic T-position. Soft, acidic water seems to be essential (peat filtration suggested) and a ratio of 2 males to every female tends to work best. Keeping the young fry alongside other Corydoras sp. fry can help encourage them to follow suit and begin feeding.",

        "care": "The mighty Adonis Plec was originally described from the lower Rio Tocantins, but is thought to have a much wider distribution throughout the Amazon basin. This is a giant amongst suckermouth catfish, which is only really suited to the most substantial home aquarium installations and public aquaria. Indeed, the tank must be of vast proportions with powerful, oversized filtration to match. The substrate should consist of soft sand with huge pieces of bogwood arranged to create a number of shady caves and crevices. Rockwork can also be provided, but you must ensure this is heavy enough and stable enough not to be disturbed by the movement of this big catfish. There should be brisk water movement and a high level of oxygenation, perhaps provided by powerheads (in addition to the current generated by the filtration). Dim lighting is preferable, but this can be brighter if diffused by the decor. It is best to keep only one Adonis Plec per tank, as these fish can be fiercely territorial with conspecifics and other bottom dwellers that occupy the same niche. It is not unknown for mature specimens to harass and kill other large plecs and similar species when kept in slightly cramped quarters, so choose tankmates cautiously and observe carefully. The most suitable tankmates would be medium-large sized fish which occupy the mid to upper levels of the water column, such as sizeable barbs, big Anostomids (headstanders), Brycon spp., Distichodus spp., Metynnis/Myleus spp., pike cichlids etc. Whilst juveniles may be fairly slender, they will grow at an alarming rate, quickly becoming much more robust. Additionally, the bright white spots on the body soon become relatively smaller and fewer in number, with some large adults being completely spot-free. May also be seen on sale as Polka Dot Lyre Tail Pleco. An albino variant is sometimes available.",

Unusually for a characin, they occupy the lower-middle reaches of the aquarium and can be kept alongside peaceful bottom-dwellers and many placid top-dwelling fish without problems. Fancy long-finned species are best avoided though. The aquarium itself should be at least 3ft long and incorporate areas of dense planting and shady tangles of bogwood.

        "care": "The African Butterfly Cichlid is known from shallow forest streams and savannah wetlands with muddy substrates. This is a small species that is often overlooked when juvenile, but when settled in to a planted softwater aquarium, it matures into a beautiful fish that is easy to breed. The aquarium should be spacious with a soft sand or fine rounded gravel substrate. There should be plenty of shady hiding places provided amongst areas of dense planting, driftwood, and caves (including a few smooth flat rocks to provide potential spawning sites). Filtration should be efficient, but water movement not too strong, and small partial water changes should be carried out on a regular basis to keep nitrate at a minimum. African Butterfly Cichlids are generally shy, peaceful (except when breeding), and are gregarious, so should be maintained in groups of 8 or more wherever possible. Tankmates should be peaceful and could include small barbs, Corydoras catfish, dwarf gouramis, small Loricariids (suckermouth catfish), rainbowfish, rasboras, and tetras. If kept in cramped quarters, breeding pairs will become quite aggressive towards their tankmates, so adequate space must be provided. Wild caught specimens tend to be more colourful than the tank bred fish, and there are several geographical colour variants, including 'Guinea' and 'Kilissi River'.",
        "feeding": "Flake, micropellets, frozen foods such as daphnia, bloodworm, white mosquito larvae, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp etc.",

The water should be neutral to slightly soft and acidic with the temperature set towards the higher end of the preferred range, and there should be plenty of flat rocks such as slate for the female to deposit her eggs on to. The best way to obtain a compatible pair is to purchase a group of young fish and allow them to pair off naturally. Once a pair has formed, the remaining fish may need to be moved to another tank for their own safety. A large, cool water change often triggers the fish into spawning. The pair will select a suitable site and clean it thoroughly. Spawning occurs in much the same manner as many other cichlid species, with the female depositing a line of eggs on the cleaned spawning site, then moving away to be replaced by the male who fertilises them. Up to 500 eggs may be laid, and these will hatch within 48-72 hours. During this time, the female takes care of the eggs, whilst the male fiercely guards the perimeter. Once the eggs hatch, the entire brood will be moved into a pre-dug pit near to the spawning site, and may be moved again to other pits before they become free-swimming (usually a further 3-4 days). At this point, they can be offered baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) or microworm. The parent fish will continue to care for the young for 4 weeks or so, after which point the fry should be moved to another aquarium as the parents are quite likely to spawn again.",

        "care": "The curious-looking African Butterfly Fish originates from the calm waters of creeks, swamps and slow-moving parts of rivers, where they inhabit the area just underneath the water's surface. They are excellent jumpers, so the aquarium MUST have tight fitting coverslides to prevent accidental escape. In the wild, the African Butterfly Fish feeds on small fish, crustaceans, aquatic larvae & nymphs, as well as terrestrial insects (hence it's position in the water column and its ability to jump). The aquarium that houses these fish should not be filled right to the top, instead, it is suggested that the water level is dropped approx 15cm (6\") or so from the top of the tank. The aquarium should incorporate a good amount of aquatic plants with an open area in the centre for the fish to freely rest near the surface. Lighting should not be too bright, and the tank should be furnished with dark decor. The footprint of the tank (length and width) is much more important than the height, to give the fish as much surface area as possible. It is also a good idea to install a blue moon light to switch on just before the main lights go off, so that you can spend a few hours observing this crepuscular (active at dusk and at dawn) species when it is at its most active. More than one specimen may be kept in the same aquarium if the tank is spacious enough. Tankmates must be chosen with care, as many will find the long trailing pelvic fin rays of the African Butterfly Fish rather tempting to nibble at. Small fish can also become an easy snack as this species has a deceptively capacious mouth. Many successful aquarists find that keeping their Butterfly Fish with peaceful bottom-dwellers such as Corydoras catfish, works very well. Excellent water quality is essential for this species to thrive.",

        "breeding": "Difficult, as the tiny fry tend to only accept miniscule live foods at the water's surface which pass directly over them. African Butterfly Fish form pairs and require very soft, acidic water to breed - peat filtration is considered essential. When spawning commences, the female will lay up to 7 eggs, which the male immediately fertilises and allows to float up to the surface. This process is repeated several times until up to 250 eggs have been expelled/fertilised. The parent fish should be acclimatised back to the main aquarium as soon as spawning has ceased, otherwise they will predate on the eggs. The eggs will turn black within 12 hours and should hatch within 36-48 hours, by which time you should have a good supply of tiny live foods ready to offer.",

        "care": "In the wild, African Clawed Frogs are known from lakes, ponds, rivers, and wetlands in arid and sub-arid African climes. This species is a voracious predator and easily adapts to a wide range of habitats, from stagnant waters to clear flowing streams. Despite being classed as fully aquatic, under favourable conditions they have been known to travel short distances to other bodies of water, and as such, in some areas are regarded invasive. Nevertheless, they remain a popular aquarium pet for those wishing to keep a species-only frog tank. Indeed, kept in the right environment, this is a large, characterful species that can live for two decades or more. African Clawed Frogs are fully aquatic, but they do need to come up and take warm air from above the water's surface periodically. It is therefore essential that the tank is not too deep and you should leave a small gap between the surface of the water and the coverslides/lid. Substrate choice is important: it either needs to be too large (pebbles) or too fine (aquatic sand) to swallow, so that the frogs are unable to accidentally ingest it when lunging for food. Ingestion of gravel can be fatal. Sand is the preferred choice as not only should it pose no problems for the frogs when feeding, it is much easier to keep clean, as it is all too easy for uneaten food and other waste products to build up amongst coarse grained substrates. Having said this, some people prefer to use pebbles (or even keep the tank substrate free) because these frogs do like to dig and sand can be disturbed rather easily; however, this should not be an issue if the sand bed is not particularly deep. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement fairly gentle. Hiding places should be provided amongst smooth rocks, driftwood, flowerpots turned on their sides, and sturdy aquatic plants such as Anubias spp. trained to grow on the decor (plants in the substrate may be uprooted). Bear in mind that adults have powerful back legs and can be quite destructive where aquarium decor is concerned; be sure everything is safe and secure. African Clawed Frogs are sociable with their own kind - as long as all specimens are of similar size - and should be kept in small groups. They arepredators that will prey on anything they can fit in their mouths, including fish that are of similar size to themselves, so they are best maintained in a species-only environment. Ensure there are no escape holes in the top of the tank as these frogs, unsurprisingly, are expert jumpers and they cannot survive out of water for long. Every few weeks, the frogs will shed their old skin, and when this happens, they usually eat it afterwards. This species is sometimes confused with the African Dwarf Frog (Hymenochirus spp.) which is a smaller and more peaceful species. To tell the difference: African Clawed Frogs have webbed hind feet and autonomous digits on the front feet, whereas African Dwarf Frogs have four webbed feet. Furthermore, the eyes of the African Clawed Frog are set on the top of the head, and those of the African Dwarf Frog are positioned on the sides of the head. Finally, the snouts of African Clawed Frogs are flat and gently curved, with those of the African Dwarf Frogs being more pointed. The albino variety of the African Clawed Frog is the most commonly encountered.",
        "feeding": "Carnivorous. Offer a variety of foods including sinking pellets/granules (such as Tetra ReptoMin) and meaty frozen foods such as white mosquito larvae, bloodworm, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, mysis shrimp, krill, and prawns. These frogs can tear prey with their claws. Be sure not to overfeed as these frogs tend to be very greedy.",
        "breeding": "African Clawed Frogs mate in what is known as amplexus (Latin for 'embrace'). This is a type of direct contact mating behaviour exhibited by some externally fertilising species, including amphibians. The male African Clawed Frog grasps the female's abdomen just in front of her hind legs using his front legs, and at the same time, or with a little delay, he fertilises the eggs as the female releases them. Amplexus usually happens at night, after one or more nights of courtship 'singing' and excited moving about by the male. Once in the amplexus position, the male will change the tone of his call and will hold onto the female for several hours. If the female is receptive, she will repeatedly spin about on the spot, or swim short distances, whilst towing the male. In this position, the female releases between 1-5 eggs at a time, which are simultaneously fertilised by the male. The adults will predate on the eggs so are best acclimatised to another aquarium once the female is spent of eggs. Hatching should occur within 2-4 days (temperature dependent) and the resulting 4mm tadpoles will require feeding with infusoria, moving on to baby brineshrimp and microworms when large enough. Approximately 6-8 weeks post hatch, the tadpoles will metamorphose into tiny frogs.",

        "care": "In the wild, African Dwarf Frogs are known from creeks, ponds, streams, shallow rivers, and, during the rainy season, in flooded areas of the forest. Here they spend much time on the substrate looking for food, their colouration allowing them to blend in with the mud and leaf litter. African Dwarf Frogs are fully aquatic, but they do need to come up and take warm air from the water's surface periodically. Cover in the form of Catappa leaves and aquatic plants will provide security as well as places to forage. Sand is the preferred substrate, as not only should it pose no problems for the frogs when feeding, it is much easier to keep clean, as it is all too easy for uneaten food and other waste products to build up amongst coarse grained substrates. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement fairly gentle. African Dwarf Frogs are very sociable and should be kept in small groups. They are generally peaceful towards fish of similar size, but tankmates must be chosen carefully as adults will take very small fish and fry. These placid amphibians are more likely to be the victims of aggression, so do not house them with any large, aggressive/nippy species. The African Dwarf Frogs will spend most of their time at the bottom of the aquarium, however, from time to time, they may appear to float in one spot with all limbs outstretched. Ensure there are no escape points in the top of the tank as these frogs will often explore and they cannot survive out of water for long. Be sure not to confuse African Dwarf Frogs (Hymenochirus spp.) with African Clawed Frogs (Xenopus laevis). The latter grow much larger and require a species-only aquarium due to their predatory nature. To tell the difference: African Dwarf Frogs have four webbed feet, whereas African Clawed Frogs have webbed hind feet and autonomous digits on the front feet. Furthermore, the eyes of the African Dwarf Frog are positioned on the sides of the head, and those of the African Clawed Frog are set on the top of the head. Finally, the snouts of African Dwarf Frogs are pointed, and those of the African Clawed Frogs are flat and more gently curved. The most obvious difference is that most captive Xenopus are albinos, whereas even the blonde form of Hymenochirus is always dark eyed and never as pale.\nMay also be seen as Congo frog or online by the acronym ADF.",
        "feeding": "Carnivorous. Offer a variety of foods including sinking pellets/granules and meaty frozen foods such as white mosquito larvae, bloodworm, daphnia, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, finely chopped mysis shrimp/krill/prawns. If fish are present in the same aquarium, the frogs may need target feeding.",
        "breeding": "African Dwarf Frogs mate in what is known as amplexus (Latin for 'embrace'). This is a type of direct contact mating behaviour exhibited by some externally fertilising species, including amphibians. The male African Dwarf Frog grasps the female's abdomen just in front of her hind legs using his front legs, and at the same time, or with a little delay, he fertilises the eggs as the female releases them. Amplexus usually happens at night, after one or more nights of courtship 'singing' by the male. Once in the amplexus position, the male will hold onto the female for several hours. If the female is receptive, she will repeatedly swim to the surface and dive back down in a circular pattern, whilst towing the male. As she nears the surface each time, sticky eggs are released, the male releasing sperm simultaneously to fertilise them. The adults will predate the eggs so are best acclimatised to another aquarium. Hatching should occur within 2-5 days (temperature dependent) and the resulting 3-4mm tadpoles will require feeding with infusoria, moving on to baby brineshrimp and microworms when large enough. Approximately 6-8 weeks post hatch, the tadpoles will metamorphose into tiny frogs which remain aquatic for life.",

        "care": "The African Knifefish has a wide area of distribution throughout tropical Africa, including the Chad, Congo, Niger, Nile, and Ogowe basins. Although it is found in a variety of different water parameters, it prefers quieter areas with an abundance of aquatic vegetation. This nocturnal predator tends to seek refuge in dimly lit, sheltered nooks and crannies during the day, emerging at night to feed on crustaceans, insects, snails, and worms. The African Knifefish is reasonably easy to keep, provided that some key requirements are met. Firstly, this fish grows fairly large and cannot really bend, so a spacious aquarium (at least 4ft long and a minimum 18\" wide) is a must. Secondly, the knifefish must be provided with a choice of shady hiding spots e.g. wide PVC tubes, flowerpots on their sides, rocky caves/overhangs (do ensure such structures are stable), and large tangles of driftwood. The lighting should not be too bright as these nocturnal fish are sensitive to intense illumination; if the tank must be brightly lit in some areas, provide plenty of broad leaved aquatic plants and floating species to help diffuse the light. Nonetheless, there absolutely must be areas of darkness within the tank that the fish can retreat to during the day as necessary. The substrate should consist of soft sand in order that the fish may grub about safely when searching for food, and so that the delicate anal fin does not become torn in any sharp gravel. Decent filtration, and moderate levels of flow and oxygenation are required, along with a consistent maintenance regime encompassing regular partial water changes, as these fish are sensitive to elevated nitrate and sudden changes in water chemistry. African Knifefish are generally peaceful with other fish (which are large enough not to be eaten overnight), but they are territorial with their own kind and other knifefish, so should be kept one to a tank and not with any other knifefish species. Tankmates should be of similar temperament and large enough not to be considered a snack; good companions could include angelfish, eartheaters (Geophagus spp.), medium-sized gouramis, medium-sized characins, large rainbowfish, African Butterfly Fish, Synodontis catfish etc. Avoid housing with any aggressive or boisterous species, and do not attempt to keep alongside snails or shrimps as these would be predated upon. When first introduced to the aquarium, the African Knifefish is often very shy, but over time, it will gain confidence - indeed, some specimens may become so tame that they may take food from the hand of the aquarist, or even sit in the hand itself whilst feeding. Blue moon lighting, timed to come on just before the main lights switch off in the evening, is useful in observing your knifefish for a few hours under its preferred subdued lighting. Due to a specially adapted swim bladder which acts as an accessory breathing organ, African Knifefish need to take in warm air from above the waters surface periodically, so a small gap must be left between the surface of the water and the cover slides in order for the fish to accomplish this. The knifefish may emit an audible bell-like sound as it takes in air. Hopefully, if the tank is maintained appropriately and new fish are quarantined carefully before adding the main aquarium, the need for medications should not arise. However, if treatment is required, take much care as these fish are classed as 'scaleless' and are particularly sensitive to medications (always check with the manufacturer before using - some treatments are not safe, and others may need half dosing). Many aquarists also find that running a UV steriliser on the tank helps to eliminate pathogens and safeguards against the need for putting treatment in the water.",
        "feeding": "African Knifefish are micro-predators and should be offered a variety of small, meaty foods. Frozen fare could include bloodworm, white/black mosquito larvae, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, Mysis shrimp etc, along with some dried foods such as slow sinking granules/pellets for carnivores. At least one feed per day should be after lights out (or under blue moon lighting).",
        "breeding": "This species has been bred in the home aquarium, but few details are available. It is not a common occurrence because most aquarists can only house one per tank due to their territorial nature. During courtship, the pair are said to produce audible 'barking' sounds. 150-200 eggs are reportedly deposited/fertilised in a suitable crevice during the night, which the male then guards. The eggs should hatch within 6-9 days (temperature dependent) and can be offered baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii). The adults will predate on the young, so it may be best to transfer them to another aquarium once the eggs begin to hatch.",

        "care": "The African Pike Characin is known from the from the Sassandra River, Ivory Coast, eastwards to the Kienka River in Cameroon, and the Chari River, Central African Republic. Here, it is found amongst the marginal vegetation of a variety of deepwater habitats, including upper river courses and smaller tributaries, coastal lagoons, and lakes - favouring areas where the large, predatory Hydrocynus alestids are absent or scarce.\nThe African Pike Characin is a large sized, ambush predator that requires a huge aquarium with powerful filtration to match. Juvenile fish grow quickly, so spacious quarters are required from the outset. Ideally the tank will be mature, with tangles of driftwood and dense thickets of tall plants to provide shade and hiding places. Floating vegetation can also be useful in helping to diffuse the light and will provide additional shelter and security. These elongate fish tend to lunge at their food with lightning speed, so they must be provided with adequate swimming space, along with some very tight fitting coverslides to prevent them from accidentally jumping out. Prior to setting up a tank for this species, it is worth purchasing some structured 3-D aquarium-safe background and attaching this to the inside glass of the back and sides. This will help to prevent the fish from damaging their jaws when swimming at speed into the otherwise unseen glass at the sides. Filtration should be efficient with a moderate - but not overpowering - water flow, and a good level of oxygenation. As a riverine species, these fish will not tolerate a high nitrate level; ensure partial water changes are carried out on a frequent basis to help keep organic wastes to a minimum. In voluminous aquaria, juveniles may be kept in groups, but as they mature they often become increasingly aggressive towards conspecifics and may need to be separated for their own safety - particularly if individuals grow at different rates (the larger specimens will relentlessly bully the smaller fish). For this reason, it is often better to house just one per tank, allowing it to grow up alongside other large fish that can look after themselves - but do observe carefully.\nPossible companions could include other large characins, sizeable cyprinids, large armoured catfish and the like. Avoid overly aggressive tankmates such as some of the larger Central American cichlids. Do take care when carrying out routine maintenance on the aquarium, as although accidental bites are unlikely, they are possible if the fish feels threatened/defensive, or if it mistakes the fingers for food - they possess needle-sharp dentition.",
        "feeding": "Smaller specimens will enjoy bloodworm, white mosquito larvae, Spirulina/vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, and Mysis shrimp. Move on to bigger foodstuffs such as krill, prawns, earthworms, mussel meat, cockle meat, lancefish, pieces of white fish flesh etc.etc as the fish grow. Unlikely to take dried foods.",
        "breeding": "This species has been bred in the home aquarium, but it is a rare occurrence. In the wild, several thousand eggs are deposited in a thick bubble nest at the water's surface constructed amongst floating vegetation. The eggs actually sit just above the water line, and upon hatching, the larvae wriggle down through the bubble nest to the water. Here, they attach themselves to the underside of the nest using a special cement gland (which produces a sticky secretion) on the top of their heads, and hang in this tail down position for around 4-5 days. The adults guard the nest during this time, and any fry that fall away from the nest are quickly taken up and transferred back to the underside of the nest. Once the fry are developed enough to begin moving away from the nest, they will not stray far and will attach themselves to adjacent vegetation. As they develop further, the fry rely less and less on their cement gland and after a week or so will become free-swimming.",

Tankmates should be of similar size and temperament; small or long-finned species must be avoided. Good tankmates could include Pelvicachromis spp. African dwarf cichlids or perhaps some of the smaller Synodontid catfish species. The aquarium should have a dark substrate and background, and ideally will have plenty of driftwood and dense planting. This will help the fish to feel more secure and will show their colours off beautifully. Try to aquascape the tank with most of the decor towards the rear of the aquarium, leaving a large open swimming space along the front of the tank. The water should be clean and well-oxygenated, with a moderate flow rate. Quite unlike many characins, the Red-eyed Tetra has very large scales giving it a slightly barb-like appearance.",

Soft water may be necessary to ensure success. When conditioned and ready to spawn, the male will vigorously drive the female over clumps of vegetation, where up to 1000 eggs will be deposited. Depending on water temperature, the eggs should hatch within 24-36 hours and once the yolk sacs have been absorbed, the fry should be offered appropriately sized first foods such as infusoria or powdered baby fish food. In the community aquarium, many of the eggs will be predated upon, so if you wish to raise a larger number of fry to adulthood, it would be worth setting up a separate breeding aquarium with a mesh divider just above the base. That way the eggs will fall through to safety and the parents can be relocated to the main aquarium once spawning is over.",

In many places the substrate is composed of leaf litter. The home aquarium should contain soft, acidic water and be biologically mature before these fishes are added. Ideally there will be dark substrate and dense planting, with plenty of hiding places/territories amongst rocks, driftwood, coconut shells etc. Floating plant cover could be used to help diffuse the light. Peat filtration and the addition of dried Indian Almond Leaves (Terminalia catappa) would be beneficial to help create the favoured conditions, and be aware that the tank should have a tight fitting cover, as these fish can jump. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement gentle, and frequent partial water changes should be carried out in order to keep nitrate at a minimum. A. agassizii are generally peaceful, but can become rather territorial when breeding. Keep either a single pair, or in larger aquaria, one male with several females (which will form a harem). The females will seek out individual territories, hence the importance of many visual barriers within the tank. Good tankmates include Corydoras catfish, hatchetfish, pencilfish, small tetras, and suckermouth catfish. Like many of the Apistogramma species, A. agassizii will not tolerate an elevated nitrate level. Regular partial water changes are an absolute must for their continued wellbeing.

Up to 150 eggs will be laid on the ceiling of the cave or pot, and these will be guarded by the female. The male fish will guard the general harem territory. The eggs should hatch after 2 to 4 days, depending on water temperature. The female continues guarding the wrigglers, and after a further few days, will lead the fry out of the cave. She will be very pugnacious at this point, fending off any would-be predators. The fry will require frequent small feeds with appropriately sized foodstuffs at this point, such as baby brineshrimp. If the spawning has occurred in a general community tank, it is a good idea to feed the other fish their food at the opposite end of the aquarium at the same time, to avoid undue stress to the female, who will be desperately trying to guard her young.

Here it inhabits the slower reaches of rivers, living amongst submerged roots and marginal vegetation. The Altum Angelfish is a majestic species which requires a taller than average aquarium, due to its potential adult height and long trailing finnage. Soft, acidic water with negligible hardness is requisite. Adults should never be housed with small fish (e.g. Neon Tetras) as they will quickly become a snack. The substrate should be soft and smooth, so as to protect the delicate finnage when the fish are swimming in the lower reaches of the tank, and a good cover of aquatic plants along with some tall pieces of driftwood should be provided in order for the fish to feel safe. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement fairly gentle, and small frequent water changes will help to keep pollutants to a minimum (these fish are very sensitive to elevated nitrates). In larger aquaria, Altum Angelfish can be maintained in good size groups; this will not only make them feel much more secure, but it will result in a much more effective, natural looking shoal. Tankmates should be of similar size, and be of a peaceful disposition. Good companions could include some of the larger, deeper-bodied characins, other peaceable South American cichlids, sizeable Corydoras catfish etc. Be aware that if a pair of Altum Angelfish form, they will become very territorial when breeding, so observe carefully; however, this should not cause issues in voluminous aquaria. Not recommended for beginners.",

        "breeding": "This species has been bred in the home aquarium, but it can be rather difficult. Very soft, acidic water is required, and the tank should be furnished with a selection of potential spawning sites, such as broad-leaved aquatic plants and flat pieces of slate stood upright against the back glass of the aquarium. When ready to spawn, the breeding tubes (genital papillae) will begin to show on both fish, between the ventral and anal fins. Do not disturb the aquarium once egg-laying/fertilisation commences. The parents should be left to tend the eggs - they will be seen carefully fanning them with their pectoral fins. After 2-3 days, the eggs should begin to hatch into \"wrigglers\" and after a further 4 or 5 days, they should become free-swimming and they can be offered baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii). However, it is not always this straightforward. Once a pair has formed and they begin spawning, it is not unusual for them to eat their eggs. This can be frustrating and if it keeps occurring, it may be necessary to separate the parents from their spawn if there is to be any chance of success. Other times, the adults may spawn once, and then never again, despite trying to encourage them via cooler water changes etc.",

Do not keep with any large or aggressive fish species as they will become an expensive meal. As with all shrimp species, acclimatisation must be carried out slowly and carefully. If ever you need to medicate an aquarium containing Amano Shrimp, please check with the manufacturer that the intended medication is safe with shrimp, as not all are. Amano Shrimps will moult regularly whilst growing, and the sudden appearance of perfectly formed shrimp casings on the floor of the aquarium can cause alarm to fishkeepers who have not seen this before. Once the shrimp has moulted, it will remain hidden for a time until the new shell hardens and it has a bit more protection.\n  Although not as dramatic as some shrimp species, colour forms have been produced and White or Orange strains can now be found alongside the original wild type.

The aquarium should be mature and densely planted with hardy or fast-growing species, and the addition of floating cover to help diffuse the light will be much appreciated by these fish. As American Flagfish are omnivorous, delicate soft-leaved species are likely to be eaten. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement gentle in order to replicate the natural habitat. American Flagfish are fairly peaceful when not in spawning mode, and a spacious aquarium with plenty of hiding places should limit any problems if they do choose to spawn. Any aggression at this time is normally aimed towards conspecifics, but given sufficient room and provided they have ample visual barriers amongst the decor and plants, this should not become an issue. Tankmates should be of similar size and temperament, and be happy to live in the same cooler, slightly alkaline conditions. American Flagfish often browse on various types of algae within the aquarium, and if there is not much of this present, the diet should be supplemented with plenty of greenfoods to meet their nutritional needs and help deter the fish from nibbling on too many fragile plants. Immature American Flagfish often appear fairly drab and olive green in the confines of a shop stock tank, but given time to settle into appropriate conditions and grow, the males in particular will colour up spectacularly. A dark coloured substrate will help to make the fish feel more secure and in turn will showcase the dazzling colours of mature male fish.",

        "breeding": "In a heavily vegetated and spacious tank, very small numbers of fry may appear from time to time. To ensure a greater survival rate, a separate breeding aquarium (at least 24\" long, but shallow) should be set up with similar conditions to the main tank, except the water temperature should be towards the top of the preferred range. Use a very gentle method of filtration such as an air-powered sponge filter, and furnish the breeding tank with a fine substrate and floating plants to provide cover and possible places to spawn. There should be a small amount of decor to allow the female to hide and rest in between spawns. Add a well-conditioned pair to the tank and observe carefully; sometimes the male can drive the female quite hard, and if she is not quite ready to spawn, he could damage her. (If the fish do not seem ready to spawn, place a clear divider in the tank so that they can see each other but not physically get to one another. It will be quite obvious when the divider can be removed as the fish will both be showing much interest in one another). American Flagfish may spawn by using a couple of different approaches, which seem to occur depending on how the tank is set up. When both fish are ready to spawn, it is not always the male that initiates the courtship ritual \" it could be either sex that triggers this event with enticing, quivering dances displayed to the other fish. Eggs will be deposited/fertilised either in a depression in the substrate or near the water's surface, depending on water depth. As mentioned previously, a shallower tank is preferable as it would seem that the fry need to be able to access the surface easily during the early stages of their development. Further spawning activity is likely to take place over the next few days, with more batches of eggs being scattered each time. If spawning occurs on the substrate, the male will guard the eggs from predators, all the while fanning them with his pectoral fins in a manner similar to many cichlid species. If this occurs, the female fish should be removed for her own safety, as the male will become very aggressive towards her whilst protecting the eggs and she will be in a weakened state anyway. If the eggs are deposited in the roots of floating plants at the water's surface, the fish will exhibit no brood care and should be removed from the tank once it is clear that spawning has ceased (this will be obvious as one fish will suddenly not respond to any advances made by the other). The eggs should hatch in 7-10 days, dependent on water temperature; at this point, if the male fish has been tending the eggs, he should be removed. Many aquarists report that if the fry are unable to reach the surface of the water soon after hatching, they tend to expire in large numbers. This is thought to be related to the development of the swimbladder, and so it is very important to ensure that the tiny fry do not have to swim too far to reach the surface. They should initially be offered green water/infusoria, moving on to baby brineshrimp, then larger foodstuffs as they grow. Unfortunately, larger sized fry will not hesitate to eat their smaller siblings, so you may need to separate the fry by sizes if some are growing more quickly than others.",

Initially hard to breed, their process of domestication started decades ago and continues to this day. During this process, it's likely that a few currently undescribed species were crossed, giving an aquarium strain that differs from their wild relatives and occurs in a wide range of colour, scale and fin types. Black angels seem to require more protein that other forms and should be fed a richer diet when young, to ensure healthy growth.\nMost people who've owned a community tank have kept angels and they're often added to unsuitable aquaria where they eat small tetra tank mates and bully their companions. Although they're cichlids, angels are sociable and naturally live in groups. Pairs leave the group to spawn and rear their young in temporary territories held during the breeding season. To echo this way of life, they're best kept as a group in a tank large enough for pairs to form and form discreet territories. Kept in this way, they'll be far too busy to bully any other species unless they're chasing them from their chosen spawning site. Eating small fish is harder to prevent and this is why they should never be housed alongside small tetras such as Neons. Tankmates too large to swallow whole are generally ignored but take care to avoid adding tank mates likely to nip the angel's fins.\nThese are hard fish to sex as youngsters but as males grow faster than females, buying a mix of sizes (within a group of fishes the same age) should guarantee pairs.

Tankmates must be small and peaceful, and able to thrive in warm, fast-flowing water. As these fish do not compete well for food, avoid keeping with fish that are boisterous at feeding times. Angelicus Plecs are largely carnivorous and will not make any impact on algae. Ensure that regular partial water changes are carried out as these catfish will not tolerate an elevated nitrate level. This fish has been assigned more than one L-number in the past, and it is still not clear whether these are all geographical variants of the same, or whether they represent separate species. L004 was determined to be the juvenile phase of L005, with L028 and L073 being almost identical, but found at different localities.",
        "feeding": "Offer a variety of meaty foodstuffs such as bloodworm, white mosquito larvae, Mysis shrimp, chopped prawns, and various sinking pellets designed for carnivores. Vegetables such as slices of cucumber may be nibbled at but are not usually taken with any real enthusiasm.",
        "breeding": "This species has been bred in the home aquarium and makes for a very worthwhile breeding project. The temperature of the water should be raised to 28 \u00b0C and it must be extremely well-filtered and highly oxygenated. Provide a selection of small caves which have an entrance only marginally bigger than the fish \"\u201c these can either be formed from arranging the rockwork in such a way that small secluded crevices are created, or pre-constructed from small pieces of slate siliconed together. It is crucial that these caves are situated in an area with decent water movement. When in spawning condition, males will choose a preferred cave and defend it from any other males present, whilst at the same time, will try to entice a ripe female inside. Spawning does not always take place straight away, indeed it can be some days before the female is ready to deposit her eggs, but the fish will remain inside the cave together during this time, the male usually blocks the entrance. Once the eggs have been laid and fertilised, the male fish often has to force the female out of the cave before he begins his parental guarding duties. The female plays no further part in brood care, but the male will be seen fanning the eggs with his pectoral fins and blocking the cave entrance from any intruders. Eggs typically number around 45 and take around a week to hatch. The fry will feed from their sizeable yolk sacs for the first few days, and after this has been consumed, they will require very regular feedings of baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii), microworms, and various small or crushed dried sinking foods. It is important that food is available to the fry at all times as they can all too easily starve, but keep a very close eye on water quality when feeding constantly, and perform lots of very regular but very small partial changes to keep nitrogenous waste levels as low as possible. The adult Angelicus Plecs pose no threat to the fry, but other fish sharing the same tank might do. This is why many aquarists like to keep these catfish in a species-only set up, to further their chances of raising the maximum number of young.",

Here it lives in flowing waters and adjacent lakes over rocks, silt and mud.\nAs with almost all Central American cichlids, this is a fish that needs hard water to thrive. There should be a soft sandy substrate and numerous hiding places/visual barriers created amongst the decor from large pieces of driftwood and rocks/slate. Most aquatic plants will be seen as food, so are best omitted from the aquascape, or else consider using plastic/silk varieties. Filtration should be very efficient (these fish are messy eaters) but water movement fairly gentle. This species is sensitive to the build-up of pollutants, so small frequent water changes are a must to help keep nitrogenous waste to a minimum. The Angostura cichlid is a fairly typical territorial cichlid - aggression levels are tied to aquarium size and if enough room is provided for fishes to avoid one another, disputes are generally resolved through display. The best results come from keeping these fish in a good-sized group from which they can select mates, expect males to grow faster than females and avoid selecting all the largest individuals in the batch when buying juveniles as you may end up with a bachelor group. Good tankmates include large armoured catfish, and robust barbs or characins that can tolerate harder water.",

In order to give him a target for his aggression, a mirror attached to one of the end panels of the breeding tank will prevent him from viewing his mate as the only potential threat. The eggs should hatch within 3-4 days, and the fry should be free-swimming just a few days later.

This species grows quite large and can be somewhat skittish, so a very spacious aquarium (at LEAST 6ft x 2ft x 2ft, preferably larger) with powerful filtration and water movement is required. Excellent water quality must be maintained at all times as they are rather intolerant of a build up of organics. Apollo Sharks are energetic swimmers that tend to occupy the top section of the aquarium and do require some form of shelter plus a large open swimming space. It is extremely important to fit tight fitting coverslides and ensure there are no escape holes, as these fish are expert jumpers when startled. It is best to site the tank in a quiet area where there is less chance of the fish being continually disturbed by foot traffic. Apollo Sharks are gregarious by nature so they are best kept in groups of 6 or more. These fish form a pecking order, and if too small a group is maintained (such as 2 or 3 specimens), the dominant individual will continually pick on the others, sometimes with disastrous consequences. Kept in large enough groups, this behaviour should not become problematic as any belligerence will be spread amongst the group and no individual fish should bear the brunt of it. Having said this, Apollo Sharks are usually peaceful towards their tankmates, providing they are large enough not to swallow. Do remember though, that the frenzied feeding habits of the Apollo Sharks may intimidate slow, shy, or nervous fish, so choose tankmates with care. Similar sized cyprinids from the Barbonymus, Crossocheilus, Cyclocheilichthys, and Puntius genera may be suitable, as would Silver Sharks and larger Botiid loaches.

Having been introduced to areas outside of their natural range, they proved to be a serious agricultural pest and are particularly destructive to rice and taro crops. This led to an EU-wide ban on their sale which has been lifted in the UK (excluding NI) thanks to our climate being unsuitable for these tropical animals.\nAs aquarium pets, these snails are clearly not the best choice for tanks where aquatic plants are a priority but, in most cases, they prefer to consume dead or dying plant matter as well as fish food etc. Although there\"\u2122s some differences between species, most will graze algae growth but are unlikely to have a huge impact on the cleanliness of their aquarium in this regard. Compatibility issues with these animals tend to be rather one-sided, take care not to add them to communities housing snail eating loaches, pufferfishes or cichlids. Some fish will investigate them when they\"\u2122re moving around the aquarium but keep an eye out for undue harassment that prevents the snails from feeding and more importantly, moving to breathe air at the water\"\u2122s surface.\nLike all invertebrates, snails will be harmed by most fish medications especially those containing copper. In the event of a disease outbreak, it may be best to remove them for a time to enable the use of effective chemicals. For their part, most health issues in apple snails can be attributed to feeding or chemical contamination \"\u201c always use a water conditioner to avoid heavy metal contamination from tap water.

Incredibly, they have the ability to compensate for visual refraction when aiming, and almost always achieve their target, which can be well over a metre away. They will also leap clear of the water on occasion to grab at insects they judge to be easy pickings. The aquarium that houses these remarkable fish should be spacious (at least 5ft x 2ft x 2ft) and with a dropped water level and tight fitting coverslides. In this way, the fish will display their natural water-shooting ways when feeding time occurs. Large paludarium style set ups with twigs and planting above the surface of the water work very well. Some owners do offer insect based foods such as crickets, but these fish will happily take other prepared floating foodstuffs, often shooting water at the owner when getting impatient! In the wild, Archerfish are regularly found congregating in small groups and so are best maintained in shoals of at least 6 specimens of a similar size. Any less a number could amount in aggression related problems, with certain fish being continually picked upon. A larger number of specimens is not only more natural, but will also spread any aggression amongst the group. The entire group should be introduced simultaneously - monitor the water quality carefully - as newcomers (particularly smaller specimens) are often not accepted. The tank should be aquascaped to include some shadier areas amongst large bogwood pieces and slate stood up at the back of the aquarium, along with resin \"root\" ornaments. These fish can be a little nervous, particularly when first introduced, so hiding spots and darker areas of shelter will be appreciated. Aquatic vegetation is safe with Archerfish, although species chosen should be tolerant of brackish conditions. Archerfish are sensitive to pollutants, so it is very important that the aquarium water is kept in excellent condition at all times with a decent amount of filtration and frequent partial water changes. If maintaining at the higher end of the preferred temperature range, ensure that the water is well oxygenated. Archerfish can be kept alongside other brackish water fish, including juvenile Scats and Monodactylus species, Knight gobies and Orange Chromides. Large Archerfish are more than capable of eating small fish, so ensure any potential tankmates are of a suitable size.",

The relatively large eggs will be scattered over the plants a few at a time. These fish are known as 'continual spawners' which means that the spawning activity takes place over several days/weeks. This can present problems to the aquarist in that some adult fish may begin to consume the eggs as they are scattered, although this may not be a problem if the adults are kept well fed. However, many fishkeepers have found the eggs to be remarkably tough and have had great success in siphoning them out into another aquarium (containing matching water from the spawning tank) or else using spawning mops, which, when having caught a number of the eggs, can be moved to a separate tank (again with matching water) and replaced with a new mop, as and when each series of eggs are deposited.

The aquarium should be well-filtered with a decent level of oxygenation and areas of fast current. Frequent partial water changes should be carried out to keep nitrate levels at a minimum. Arulius Barbs appreciate some shady planted areas, but because of their appetite for all things green and leafy, only the more robust plant species (Java fern, Anubias sp. etc) should be chosen. Most other plants will end up on their menu! These fish make great companions for larger species of botiid loaches. Not to be kept with small fish or fancy long-finned species. Males will occasionally argue amongst themselves, but no real harm should ensue. The common name of this species is quite misleading. For years, this species was traded under the 'Arulius Barb (Dawkinsia arulius)' nametag, before it was discovered, that actually, it was not D. arulius, but D. tambraparniei.

This attractively patterned, predatory bottom-dweller requires a spacious aquarium with a soft sand substrate. There should be plenty of shady hiding places/visual barriers amongst driftwood, rocky caves, PVC pipes/flowerpots, and robust planting. The more hiding places that are provided, the more the catfish is likely to venture out and about, as it will get to know it has safe places to quickly retreat to if it feels the need. Dim lighting is preferred, but this can be brighter if it is diffused with broad leaved plants or floating vegetation. A blue moon light timed to come on just before the main lights switch off will provide you with time in the evening to watch the nocturnal antics of this catfish under its preferred subdued conditions. Filtration should be efficient, with areas of moderate water movement along with some quieter resting spots out of the current. Ensure that heaters are covered with heater guards to prevent the catfish from being burned when looking for dark crevices to rest against. Despite being rather reclusive, this is a somewhat territorial species which is best maintained singly and not with any similar bottom-dwellers. Tankmates should be chosen with care, as small fish will be eaten, and larger slow fish with showy fins will be nipped at overnight. Good companions could include some of the medium-sized barbs, danionins, rainbowfish, or rasboras, and sizeable shoals of them may actually help to encourage the catfish out into view a little more. To the untrained eye, this species could easily be confused with the various South American Bumblebee catfish from the Pimelodidae family. However, like all bagrids, the Asian Bumblebee Catfish has a pair of nasal barbels that originate just in front of the eyes.",

Here it favours heavily vegetated, slow-flowing backwaters, coastal lakes, inundated fields, quiet streams, and swamps. The laterally compressed body and cryptic colour pattern affords this species great camouflage against plants and fallen leaves, and any unsuspecting fish that swim too near are ambushed with ferocious speed and agility. The aquarium should be mature and spacious, with a dark substrate and an abundance of hiding places amongst tangles of driftwood and dense, jungle-like planting. In addition to rooted varieties, floating species can be useful to help diffuse the light and make these shy fish feel more secure. The addition of a small quantity of leaf litter would also be beneficial - dried Indian Almond leaves (Terminalia catappa) are ideal and are readily available, but will require periodic replacement. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement fairly gentle, and small, frequent partial water changes will help keep nitrate to a minimum. Asian Leaf Fish, although predatory, are actually quite shy and should be kept in groups of 6 or more. Ideally all specimens will be of a similar size and introduced to the aquarium simultaneously, which will help to prevent any territorial arguments that might otherwise be aimed at any newcomers. Do remember that these fish have surprisingly capacious mouths, and coupled with their nocturnal activity, this spells a very real danger for standard community fish, so they are always best maintained in a species tank environment. Not recommended for beginners. May also be seen on sale as the Gangetic Leaf Fish.",

As a shoaling species, they are best kept in groups of 6 or more fish. In the wild, they congregate in huge numbers, so the more you can keep together, the more natural it will be for them. The water in their native environment, Lake Inle - and its surrounding swamplands (where this species is also found) - is of a naturally hard alkaline composition. Here the waters are heavily vegetated and, in places, often quite turbid. The aquarium housing Asian Rummynoses should consist of dark substrate and background, with dense planting to create much appreciated shady areas. This will help to bring out their best colours, particularly those of the stunning males. If these fish are transferred to water that is too soft, they tend to be quite delicate and lose a lot of their beautiful colouration. Fairly peaceable, but a lively species when settled into ideal conditions, Asian Rummynoses are suitable to be kept alongside other small fishes of a similar disposition. However, fancy long-finned varieties are best avoided (particularly in smaller aquaria) as the fins may prove too much of a temptation. It is useful to outnumber the male Asian Rummynoses 2:1 with females wherever possible, as the presence of too many males will result in constant sparring matches. These little scuffles will still happen from time to time with the males taking on particularly superb colouration as they show off to the females, but it should not be overly-encouraged with an excess number of males in the tank, as it may well prove too stressful if it were to continually occur. These fish do not fare well at temperatures above 25 \u00b0C, so please bear this in mind when choosing possible tankmates. May also be seen on sale as Naked Microrasbora.",

Larger brood sizes are likely to be much more successful in a separate breeding aquarium furnished with the same tall broad-leaved plants and spawning mops near the surface. If more than one male is present in a confined space, they may squabble with each other and \"forget\" about spawning, hence the need to bring together just one male with one female in the small breeding aquarium. The parent fish will predate on the eggs, so it is advisable to acclimatise them back to the main aquarium once spawning has ceased. Separate spawns should not be placed into the same growing-on tank as the larger fry will pick on the smaller fry, damaging them and in some cases even killing them. Rearing the tiny fry is very challenging, with one of the main problems being their susceptibility to velvet disease.

This nocturnal catfish attains a large size and requires a very spacious aquarium (at least 6ft x 2ft x 2ft - preferably much larger), coupled with oversized filtration to cope with the amount of nitrogenous waste produced. The aquarium should be furnished with a soft sand substrate in order to protect the delicate sensory barbels when the catfish are rooting around for food, and large pieces of driftwood and smooth rocks can be used to create an abundance of shady refuges - ideally at least 2 caves per fish, to give them choice. Large diameter PVC tubing can also be used very successfully in this respect, although it may detract somewhat from the natural look. Lighting should be subdued and water movement not too vigorous. Large, robust motherplants can also be used to create shady retreats (e.g. Anubias and Microsorum spp.), and ideally these plants will be tied onto driftwood to prevent them from being dug up. Asian Sun Catfish are generally peaceful, but small fish are a part of their natural diet, so tankmates must be chosen carefully. These fish do best alongside other fish of similar size and temperament e.g. some of the larger characins and cyprinids, Polypterus spp, some medium-large cichlids and many other catfish species. As Asian Sun Catfish are naturally gregarious, they are best maintained in groups of at least 5 specimens for their continued well-being. Ideally they should all be of similar size and introduced to the aquarium at the same time. The Asian Sun Catfish (H. brachysoma) is similar in appearance to the Black Collared Catfish (H. nigricollaris) which is also seen in the trade fairly regularly. The latter displays more of a \"collar\" than a black shoulder spot, and it is altogether much more suitable for the average aquarium on account of it attaining a much smaller adult size.

The substrate should consist of soft sand in order to protect the delicate sensory barbels, with plenty of shady hiding spots provided amongst tangles of driftwood. Peat filtration and leaf litter will both help to acidify the water whilst giving it a natural tea-coloured appearance with the tannins that are released. Whilst plants are not a big feature of this species' natural habitat, they may make the aquarium more aesthetically pleasing. A. spilotus is a highly sociable species and must be kept in groups of 5 or more (10+ is better). The aquarium should be well mature before this species is added and frequent partial water changes are a must, as they can be rather sensitive to elevated nitrate levels. Large shoals of small midwater \"dither fish' will encourage these fish out into view. A. spilotus have quite a variable pattern and are capable of minor colour change depending on the colour of the substrate they are resting on. Aspidoras are closely related to the popular aquarium catfish Corydoras. The family Callichthyidae (armoured catfish) is comprised of 2 sub-families: Callichthyinae and Corydoradinae. The genus Aspidoras sits within Corydoradinae, along with the genera Brochis, Corydoras, and Scleromystax. Catfish from the Aspidoras genus are typically slightly larger than dwarf species of Corydoras (such as C. pygmaeus) but they are more elongate, less bulky, and have smaller eyes. Aspidoras also have a smaller head compared to that of Corydoras; indeed, Aspidoras possess a dual fontanel bone structure in the skull, in contrast to only one much larger fontanel in Corydoras. These catfish have the ability to breathe air intestinally, so a small gap should be left between the surface of the water and the cover slides in order for the fish to come up to the surface and take air in. They may do this numerous times per day. Often seen on sale labelled simply as C125.",

The semi-adhesive eggs will then be deposited onto plants, decor, or the sides of the aquarium etc and the process repeated. The eggs generally take around 30 hours to hatch, and after a further 24 hours the fry will have used up their yolk sacs and become free-swimming and are able to take finely-powdered first foods, microworms, and newly hatched brineshrimp.

Provide an abundance of surface cover in the form of floating plant species to help diffuse the light. Filtration should be efficient with areas of moderate water movement and quieter resting areas out of the current, and frequent partial water changes are important to help keep nitrate to a minimum. It is essential that the aquarium has a tight fitting lid as these fishes are expert jumpers, and a small gap must be left between the surface of the water and the coverslides in order for the fish to come up and take in humid air. Using a tall aquarium with a low water level planted in a paludarium style, greatly reduces the likelihood of jumping, as well as providing plenty of surface cover and natural control of dissolved wastes. Snakeheads are obligate air breathers, which means they must have access to atmospheric air or they will drown. This is a territorially aggressive species that is best maintained singly or as a compatible male-female pair. In order to achieve this, some aquarists prefer to obtain a group of juveniles and wait until a pair forms naturally before re-homing the others. These fish are best maintained in a species-only aquarium, if tankmates are desired, they must be able to tolerate the seasonally low winter temperatures required as this species needs a seasonal change in temperature and maintenance to emulate the wet and dry months. During the winter period that coincides with the dry season, the fishes' metabolism will slow down and they will not show much interest in food. The water level can be dropped, the day length should be shortened and the reduction in waste levels means that water changes can be dramatically reduced. Successful set ups really do echo the swamps that these fish call home. These annual rest periods seem to be imperative for long-term health, vitality, and breeding potential.\nMay also be seen labelled as Golden snakehead.",

Although a substrate of coral sand or Aragonite is often recommended to help to keep the water hard and alkaline, Mbuna feel safer and show better colours over a darker substrate. The Aragonite or coral sand can always be placed into a mesh bag and kept inside the external filter for buffering purposes. Most rock-dwelling species are extremely aggressive and need to be kept under conditions of 'controlled-overcrowding' to prevent territorial disputes ending fatally - additional filtration may also be required to cope with a heavy bioload. The Auratus cichlid is a particularly belligerent example, and it is best to keep just one male in a harem situation with several females (keeping just one female with a male will result in continual harassment and death). This species can be kept successfully alongside other outgoing Mbuna that can hold their own, although it is best to avoid fish with a similar colour pattern. Not suitable for housing with peaceful fish.

        "breeding": "This maternal mouthbrooder has been bred in the home aquarium, but it is difficult and somewhat risky due to the highly aggressive nature of this species. It should be spawned in a species-only aquarium and in a harem situation with one male and at least 5 females in order to help dissipate aggression. Ensure there are plenty of visual barriers within the aquarium, as the male has been known to kill female fish that are not receptive to his advances. When ready to spawn, the colouration of the male will intensify and his aggression level will heighten further. He will choose and clean a spawning site, then display to the female fish until one accepts him. They will circle each other in a head to tail manner a number of times, until the female deposits her eggs. These are deposited just one or two at a time and after doing so, she immediately turns around and picks them up. At the same time, the male will rotate so that he is almost on his side, at the same time shaking and extending his anal fin, releasing his milt. The female sees the egg spots on the male\"\u2122s anal fin and attempts to pick up those \"\u0153eggs\"\u009d whilst she is picking up the real ones that she deposited, and at the same time taking in milt. This is the method of fertilisation, and this ritual may go on for some hours. The eggs may be incubated for up to 25 days until they hatch and the resultant fry held for a further few days afterwards. Typical brood size for a good sized female would number between 20-40.",

        "care": "Closely related to the familiar Firemouth, Thorichthys have much in common with their distant relatives, the Eartheaters. They are usually found in groups, over sandy substrates where there is much driftwood and leaf litter for cover; the water clarity varies throughout its range, and in many places it is often a little murky and so vegetation is minimal.\nAs these fish like to sift the substrate in search of food items, it is essential that they are maintained in an aquarium with a fine, soft sand substrate. Food morsels will be eaten, and any inedible material expelled through the gills, so it is important not to use sharp sand. Ample cover should be provided in the form of driftwood and smooth rocks, leaving an open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Plants, whilst not forming a large part of their natural habitat, can be grown if fairly robust types are chosen as these cichlids are not particularly destructive, and the addition of live vegetation may make the aquarium more aesthetically pleasing. Leaf litter (e.g. dried Indian almond leaves) can be provided to create a more natural environment, but do remember to leave a decent space in the sand for these cichlids to sift through. Good water quality should be provided at all times to ensure the continued wellbeing of these beautiful fish \"\u201c a high nitrate level makes them more prone to health problems, and is so easily avoided. The aquarium really should be spacious for juveniles and adults can be colonial when breeding. Although a pair will reproduce in smaller aquaria, you will be able to observe Aureus behaving much more naturally if there is more space available - this being somewhat suppressed in smaller aquaria. Although territorial when breeding, these cichlids are not aggressive fighters the rest of the time. Instead they will often settle minor disputes amongst themselves through sheer bluff and bluster (in a similar manner to the closely related Firemouth, they will flare their gills \"\u201c which are complete with eye spots - to make themselves appear larger and more intimidating when viewed head-on), and do not follow up these threats to the same degree as some other cichlids might. In scuffles between other more boisterous cichlids, such as many of the assertive types from Central America, the Thorichthys could end up coming out of it quite badly; so for this reason it is best to keep them in a species only set-up or else with other relatively placid species. Do not house them with large, aggressive species, as this is essentially a shy, peaceful fish outside of breeding time. Many aquarists have a good deal of success keeping robust livebearers such as swordtails or goodeids along with them in a spacious environment, these acting as dither fish and encouraging the cichlids out into the open. Some of the small to medium Central American characins also make good tankmates, and if you are not fussy about creating a mix of fish from different continents, rainbowfish are another good option for shoaling mid-top water fish.\nTheir iridescent colours have led to the common name Blue Flash being used for this fish, but this can lead to confusion with many African Rift Lake cichlids.",

The eggs should hatch within 72 hours and the parents will move the larvae to a pre-dug pit in the substrate whilst they absorb their yolk sacs. The fry will be free swimming within 3-5 days and both parents will care for them, forcefully seeing off any intruders. The fry can be offered crushed flake/powdered baby fish food and baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii), moving on to bigger foodstuffs as they grow. The length of time that the parents guard the fry for does seem to vary a little, but they usually care for their offspring until they are between 1 and 2cm in length.",

It belongs to the Mbuna group of cichlids. The aquarium should be at least 4ft long and aquascaped to emulate a rocky reef effect with some open expanses of sand. Decor such as ocean rock can be used to build sturdy structures which stretch from the base of the tank to near the surface of the water. These structures should be built with the purpose of creating many crevices for the fish to explore but constructed in such a way so as to keep the rocks stable if the fish start to dig around and underneath them. Although a substrate of coral sand or Aragonite is often recommended to help to keep the water hard and alkaline, Mbuna feel safer and show better colours over a darker substrate. The Aragonite or coral sand can always be placed into a mesh bag and kept inside the external filter for buffering purposes. It is best to keep one male with several females (keeping just one will result in continual harassment and possibly death) and these can be kept successfully alongside other outgoing Mbuna.

        "care": "The Axolotl is a neotenic salamander that originates from Lake Xochimilco and Lake Chalco in the Valley of Mexico, a highland plateau in central Mexico. Unfortunately, Lake Chalco is no more, as it was artificially drained to avoid periodic flooding and to provide for land expansion. Lake Xochimilco still exists, but only as a shell of its former self, present mainly as a network of canals, many heavily polluted. As a result, this species is critically endangered in the wild; however, it is captive bred in large numbers at numerous aquaculture facilities and specimens for sale in the shops are all bred and raised in captivity. Unlike their wild counterparts, pet strains also have some input from Tiger salamanders (A. tigrinum) which introduced colours previously unknown in this species. Fortunately conservation organisations are working with pure strains and our hobby animals are never going to be used to repopulate wild habitat. Axolotls are neotonous, in that they reach maturity without undergoing metamorphosis, remaining in their aquatic form. Odd individuals may display a trait inherited from their tiger ancestors and leave the water to become mole salamanders, otherwise this is something that only occurs when an axolotl is exposed to poor water quality.  \nAxolotls do have some specialist care requirements when it comes to keeping them in the home aquarium. Firstly, substrate choice is very important - they should not be kept on gravel, as there is the very real risk of them ingesting pieces of substrate when lunging for food (this can lead to internal problems). Sand is much softer against their skin and does not pose any problems when they feed, passing freely from both ends. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement very gentle. Internal sponge filters are ideal for the Axolotl tank as they provide filtration and aeration without being too vigorous. If an external canister is used, it would be prudent to place a coarse sponge or filter bag/mesh over the intake pipe cage to prevent the Axolotls from being drawn against it and subsequently trapped by the flow. If there is too much water movement in the aquarium, the Axolotl's gills may curl forward, so be sure to reduce your flow if this occurs. A means of chilling the water may be necessary during particularly hot summers, as a prolonged water temperature above 24 \u00b0C will cause stress followed by illness and death. Gill size can vary with temperature, as oxygen content will be lower at the upper end of their tolerance, making larger gills necessary. At the other end of the scale, cold does not especially bother them and they thrive when given seasonally low temperatures. Hiding places should be provided amongst smooth rocks, driftwood, PVC pipes, and hardy aquatic plants. Regular partial water changes are essential as Axolotls require excellent water quality at all times and will not tolerate a build up of nitrate. With regards to compatibility, Axolotls will attempt to prey on anything they can fit in their mouths, including fish that are of similar size to themselves, so they are best maintained in a species-only environment. They can pose a serious risk to each other as well though. Smaller/younger Axolotls are easy targets for larger individuals and these may lose limbs or even be eaten. Fortunately, these animals can regenerate lost limbs and such injured individuals respond well to improved husbandry. When keeping a group of Axolotls, be sure to provide adequate space and ensure there are plenty of hiding places (several per Axolotl) and visual barriers amongst the decor. It is important not to overcrowd them and make sure all individuals are of approximately the same size. Axolotls are available in a selection of different colour forms. The standard 'wild type' is an olive grey colour with dark spots and gold speckling. Albino, axanthic, leucistic, and melanistic varieties are also readily available, and a rarer striking black and white piebald variety is highly sought after. As with other salamanders, the Axolotl is capable of regenerating lost limbs over a period of a few months and their immune systems function well at the colder end of their preference.",
        "feeding": "Carnivorous. Offer a variety of foods including sinking pellets/granules to ensure a diet rich in essential vitamins and minerals. Meaty frozen foods such as white mosquito larvae, bloodworm, daphnia, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, mysis shrimp, chopped krill/prawns are all suitable for animals of varying sizes and earthworms are a favourite treat.",
        "breeding": "Axolotls breed readily in the home aquarium. They can be triggered into doing so by providing a seasonal drop in temperature, after which they'll spawn naturally or often simply by performing a reasonably sized water change. The adults will predate the eggs, so you will either need to set up a separate breeding aquarium for this purpose, or have a spare tank ready to move the adults into once the female is spent of eggs. A breeding tank should have some flat pieces of slate on the base for the male to deposit his spermatophores (packets of sperm) onto, and aquatic plants for the female to deposit her eggs. Spawning is initiated by the male, who performs a courtship dance, swimming around, raising his tail and writhing excitedly. The male deposits a number of spermatophores around the tank, and then nudges the female's vent and leads her around the tank, escorting her in the right direction and encouraging her to pick up the spermatophores with her cloaca. Fertilisation takes place internally, and a few hours later, she will lay the fertilised eggs on the aquatic plants. Once the female stops laying, she and her partner should be moved to another aquarium to prevent predation. The eggs should hatch after 2-3 weeks (temperature dependent) and the young, measuring 10-13mm, will require tiny foodstuffs such as baby brineshrimp once they have used up their yolk sacs. Unfortunately cannibalism tends to be rife, and several rearing tanks may be needed so that low numbers (less than 10) can be kept in each tank, separating them into groups by size. Lowering the light level and providing dense planting is also said to help minimise cannibalism.",

        "care": "The filter feeding Bamboo Shrimp make an unusual addition to mature peaceful community aquariums with a high flow rate. Instead of claws, the first set of legs have evolved special fan-like attachments (or chelae) which the shrimp use to filter microscopic particles of food from the flowing water. Good filtration, clean and stable water conditions, along with decent water circulation is obviously a must for this species. The current within the aquarium can be further enhanced by the use of small powerheads (be sure that the model you use comes with a protective cage or filter-sponge underneath to prevent the shrimp from being drawn into the motor). Flat stones and bogwood can be piled up in the path of the flow, where the shrimp will enjoy sitting with their fans outstretched, collecting fine food particles. Bamboo Shrimps are fairly sociable and should be kept in groups. On occasion, they may become a little territorial with each other - more noticeable in smaller tanks, but they will not cause any damage to one another. The arguments are often over who gets to sit in the best area of flow! These shrimp can be kept safely with plants, although due to the water movement, hardier species should be chosen. Tankmates should be small and peaceful, and this can include smaller shrimp species such as members of the Caridina and Neocaridina genera. Avoid pufferfish, large barbs, large aggressive botiid loaches, most cichlids etc. Quite a variety of natural colours of this species are seen in the shops (beige, brown, even pinkish or dark red), and all sport a magnificent light stripe along the top of the back. They can also change colour quite quickly and dramatically to match their surroundings, a natural camouflage mechanism. Smaller specimens will moult fairly often, until they attain their adult size. Moulting usually takes place overnight, and the shrimp may hide for a few days afterwards whilst the new casing hardens, as naturally this is when they are at their most vulnerable to predators. Care must be taken when carrying out partial water changes, as Bamboo Shrimp, like all shrimp species, are sensitive to fluctuating water temperatures. Try to ensure that the new (dechlorinated) water closely matches the temperature of the tank water. Some fish medications are harmful to shrimp and other invertebrates. If treatments do have to be used in an aquarium containing shrimp, ensure that it does not contain copper. These shrimp may initially be perceived as being of a slow and clumsy nature, however, they are actually very agile and are excellent climbers/escape artists. For these reasons, make sure your shrimp tank has tight fitting coverslides. May also be seen on sale as Fan Shrimp or Singapore Wood Shrimp.",

        "breeding": "Very challenging. Although it is not uncommon to see eggs being carried by the females, raising the newly-hatched miniscule translucent larvae presents quite a problem as they require brackish water to change into miniature shrimp (known as post-larvae). The adults will not tolerate salt in the aquarium, which makes transferral and acclimatisation of the larvae into brackish conditions very difficult and risky. In nature, the larvae would be washed into saltier waters where they would develop whilst drifting in a planktonic state, and return to freshwater after several moults and taking on a miniature shrimp appearance. The miniscule size of the larvae means that an appropriately sized sponge medium must be used on the sponge filter in the brackish growing-on tank so that the larvae do not get dragged into the sponge filter. The larvae will not tolerate nitrate, so feeding can also present problems. Small amounts of green marine water are suggested as a first food.nh+",

        "care": "The Banded Bichir is known from the middle Congo River basin. Although it is found in a variety of different water parameters, it prefers quieter lakes, streams, and inundated fields, with an abundance of aquatic vegetation. This solitary nocturnal predator tends to seek refuge in dimly lit, sheltered nooks and crannies during the day, emerging at night to feed on insect larvae, worms, and small fish. An aquarium that houses this species should be spacious - ideally at least 6ft x 2ft x 2ft for adult specimens - and very well covered, as these fish are great escape artists. Ensure that any gaps where wires feed in to the aquarium are plugged securely with filter foam or mesh glued into place. The lid of the aquarium may also need to be weighted down. Banded Bichirs have the ability to breathe atmospheric air via their modified swim bladders (part of which functions as an accessory breathing organ to allow them to survive out of water for a time), so a small gap MUST be left between the surface of the water and the cover slides in order for the fish to come up to the surface and take air in. If the fish are denied regular access to air above the surface of the water, they may actually drown, so always run the tank with a dropped waterline. The substrate should consist of soft sand as these fish spend a lot of time foraging about on the bottom of the tank. Smooth water worn rocks and spindly driftwood can be used to create shady caves and there should be areas of dense planting with tall, hardy species such as Vallisneria and large Anubias or Aponogeton spp. Illumination should not be too bright, or if it is, it should be diffused via heavy planting. A blue moon light timed to come on just before the main lights switch off will allow you to view the night-time antics of these fascinating fish. The water should be filtered efficiently but with a gentle output, so that the fish do not have to contend with an overwhelming current. The Polypterus genus is closely related to the monotypic Erpetoichthys genus (Reed Fish), both of which are considered to be the last surviving relatives of some very ancient, primitive species. As their eyesight is quite poor, Banded Bichirs rely on their excellent sense of smell in order to locate food items, and although carnivorous by nature, they are generally very peaceful, and can be kept successfully alongside other medium sized peaceable species. Avoid any tankmates which are small enough to fit into their mouths, as they will be predated upon overnight. Good companions could include some of the medium sized, relatively peaceful cichlid species such as Angelfish, Severums or Festivums, large Trichogaster gouramis, knife fish, other Polypterus spp., or Synodontis catfish. Avoid any really boisterous species though, as otherwise they may outcompete your Banded Bichir at feeding times. Banded Bichirs can be kept in groups in voluminous aquaria, but ensure that all specimens are of similar size and that there is a plethora of hiding places (allow several per fish) so they can form individual territories. Be aware that although Banded Bichirs are considered quite hardy and will acclimatise to a wide range of conditions, they do not handle swings in pH well at all. Likewise, nitrates should not be allowed to creep up, so ensure that small partial water changes are carried out on a regular basis. This species is recommended for advanced aquarists only. May also be seen on sale as Armoured Bichir or Barred Bichir.",
        "feeding": "These carnivores rarely take dried foods in captivity, so you must be prepared to offer them various meaty frozen foods. Smaller specimens will enjoy bloodworm, white mosquito larvae, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp etc. whereas larger specimens will take bigger foods such as Mysis shrimp, chopped krill/prawns/mussels, earthworms etc. Occasional specimens have been known to take sinking carnivore pellets (pre-soaked in aquarium water to prevent choking \"\u201c Bichirs are notorious for gulping food down), but this is not the norm. Always try and feed just before lights out, as this is when these fish are naturally most active.",
        "breeding": "Challenging - this species has been bred in the aquarium, but very infrequently, and with few details available. It would make an excellent breeding project for the serious, dedicated hobbyist. In the wild, Banded Bichirs breed during the rainy season, so simulating a seasonal change with large, cool water changes, and an increase in current may help to trigger breeding. During courtship, the male and female swim parallel to one another, in a graceful fashion, usually through clumps of plants. The male will make jerking sideways movements with his head, towards the female\"\u2122s body. If she is ready to spawn, she will stop swimming and the male will wrap his anal fin around her genital opening. Both fish will remain motionless whilst a few eggs are deposited in a cup formed by the male\"\u2122s anal fin, and there they will be fertilised before being dispersed by powerful movements of his tail. The eggs are adhesive and will stick to the plants. This procedure is repeated many times until the female is spent of eggs (usually several hundred). The adults exhibit no parental care. The eggs should hatch after approximately 3-4 days, but remain attached to the vegetation whilst the fry absorb their yolk sacs. A few days later they will begin feeding and should be offered baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii). At this stage they have external gills with many branches and resemble salamander larvae (these external gills are lost as the fish grows).",

        "care": "The Banded Apisto has a wide area of distribution, inhabiting slow-moving, shallow blackwater creeks and tributaries of the Amazon River basin in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru - from the middle Rio Mara\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00b3n and lower Rio Ucayali basins in Peru, through the Rio Solim\u00c3\u00b5es and eastwards to the Rio Madeira at Manaus and the lower Rio Tapajas, Brazil. In many places the substrate is composed of leaf litter. The home aquarium should contain soft, acidic water and be biologically mature before these fishes are added. Ideally there will be dark substrate and dense planting, with plenty of hiding places/territories amongst rocks, driftwood, coconut shells etc. Floating plant cover could be used to help diffuse the light. Peat filtration and the addition of dried Indian Almond Leaves (Terminalia catappa) would be beneficial to help create the favoured conditions, and be aware that the tank should have a tight fitting cover, as these fish can jump. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement gentle, and frequent partial water changes should be carried out in order to keep nitrate at a minimum. A. bitaeniata are generally peaceful, but can become rather territorial when breeding. Keep either a single pair, or in larger aquaria, one male with several females (which will form a harem). The females will seek out individual territories, hence the importance of many visual barriers within the tank. Good tankmates include Corydoras catfish, hatchetfish, pencilfish, small tetras, and suckermouth catfish. Like many of the Apistogramma species, A. bitaeniata will not tolerate an elevated nitrate level. Regular partial water changes are an absolute must for their continued wellbeing. May also be seen on sale as Banded Dwarf Cichlid. Many tank-bred colour variants of this species are available, including 'blue', 'orange', 'red', 'super red', and 'yellow', plus numerous other wild forms such as 'Carreiro', 'Kleei', 'Mamori/Mamuri', 'Putumayo', 'Santa Isabel', 'Shishita', 'Shushupe', and 'Tefe Bauana' to name but a few.",

Ideally, each female fish will be provided with a suitable spawning site in the form of a cave or flower pot on its side. 40-60 eggs will be laid on the ceiling of the cave or pot, and these will be guarded by the female. The male fish will guard the general harem territory. The eggs should hatch after 2 to 4 days, depending on water temperature. The female continues guarding the wrigglers, and after a further few days, will lead the fry out of the cave. She will be very pugnacious at this point, fending off any would-be predators. The fry will require frequent small feeds with appropriately sized foodstuffs at this point, such as baby brineshrimp. If the spawning has occurred in a general community tank, it is a good idea to feed the other fish their food at the opposite end of the aquarium at the same time, to avoid undue stress to the female, who will be desperately trying to guard her young. Sometimes the female will take the fry up in her mouth and move them to another area of the tank.",

In the wild, these fish would be found amongst areas of slow-moving waters with heavy vegetation, and so to emulate this, the aquarium should be well-planted and with a gentle water flow. At first sight, this fish may seem rather plain compared to its smaller relatives but once settled into a well-planted aquarium the males will start to develop some beautiful barring reminiscent of wild Dwarf gouramis. Perhaps it was in regard to this that they earned the common name of Giant gourami - probably from people who hadn't encountered the enormous Osphronemus that really deserve this epithet. In order to avoid ending up with a fish over 60cm long, we try to stick to the alternative. There seems to be a little confusion between this fish and the closely related Thick-lipped gourami T. labiosa, with imported fish sometimes showing intermediate characteristics. Time will tell if there are undescribed species involved, a massive amount of regional variation or even natural hybridisation at play. Male Banded gouramis possess a pointed anal fin, which is rounded in Thick-lipped gouramis.\n  Recent research has determined that this fish is not the real Trichogaster fasciata, meaning that two very well established binomials are changing and the very popular Dwarf gourami should now be known as T. fasciata instead.",

They should then be moved to a shallow breeding tank filtered by a small air-driven sponge filter which will give a minimal flow rate and pose no risk of breaking up the bubblenest when constructed by the male. Spawning will occur beneath the bubblenest, with the male wrapping his body around the females in an embrace with much shaking. A huge number of eggs will be released, numbering between 500-1000, and after fertilisation, will float up into the bubblenest. Any that stray wide will be herded into the safety of the nest by the male. The male does become very aggressive at this point as he begins guarding his nest, and the female should be carefully netted out and acclimatised back to the main aquarium. The eggs should begin to hatch after 24 hours or so, at which time the male should also be removed. The fry are tiny and will need to be offered appropriately sized first foods such as infusoria. After a couple of weeks, they can be moved onto finely powdered dry foods and baby brineshrimp. It is of extreme importance to maintain a warm layer of air between the surface of the water and the coverslides at all times whilst the fry are developing their labyrinth organ, critical during the first few weeks of their life.",

In the wild, this pretty shoaling species is often found in the brackish waters of lagoons and estuaries, but it is known to migrate into fresh or marine waters for short periods.\n  Banded Green Chromides grow large and require a very spacious and well-filtered hard water or brackish aquarium. The tank should be furnished with plenty of rockwork/driftwood to create shady hiding places and visual barriers, whilst still maintaining ample space along the front of the aquarium for these active swimmers. A substrate of aragonite or crushed coral can be used to help maintain a stable alkaline pH. This peaceful species must be kept in groups of 6 or more due to its gregarious nature. However, despite having a placid personality, we do not recommend that they are housed with very small fish that would be intimidated by their sheer size, and which may themselves be considered just the right size for a snack. Good tankmates would include species that enjoy similar conditions such as larger livebearers including Sailfin mollies and Celebes rainbowfish. In a very large aquarium Archerfish, large brackish gobies, Monos, and Scats will prove very suitable. As these fish mature (in good conditions and provided with a varied diet), the colours and patterns will intensify giving the fish an absolutely dazzling appearance.

        "breeding": "Banded Green Chromides have been bred in the home aquarium, although it is considered quite challenging. In the wild, these fish spawn on a seasonal basis and are classed as clutch-tending bi-parental substrate spawners.

When ready to spawn, the pair will choose a rock/slate or cave in an area of quiet flow and pre-clean it. Some 500-1000 eggs may be deposited and these are vigorously defended by both parents. The eggs should hatch within 36-72 hours (temperature dependent) and become free swimming after a further 7 or 8 days. The fry will shoal around their parents during the first few weeks of growth, and it is thought that the adults secrete a nutritious mucous which the young initially feed upon (in a similar manner to discus). The parents are likely to refrain from feeding from the time of spawning until the fry become independent. Small first foods such as newly-hatched brineshrimp nauplii, rotifers, and powdered fry foods can be offered. High water quality must be maintained at all times as the fry are very delicate and prone to fungal infections. The colour and pattern is very different to that of the adults and it takes some time for them to develop the adult colour/pattern.",

        "care": "The Banded Leporinus has a wide distribution throughout the Amazon and Orinoco River basins, and is known from rocky areas with rapidly flowing waters. Adults congregate in sizeable shoals and may be observed feeding on crustaceans, insects, plant matter, and worms. These fish attain a large size and require a very spacious aquarium that measures at least 6ft x 2ft x 2ft (and preferably larger). Juveniles, which sport fewer vertical black stripes than the adults, grow very quickly and should be given space from the outset in order to prevent stunting and associated health problems. The aquarium should be mature and aquascaped with a sand or small-grained, smooth gravel substrate, plenty of sturdy pieces of driftwood and an open swimming space along the front of the tank. Plants are not necessary, but will make the aquarium more aesthetically pleasing; however, as these fish will devour plants, it is essential to choose robust species such as Anubias spp. and Java Fern (Microsorum) that can be tied onto the decor. Of greater importance is the use of powerful filtration (ideally provided by external canisters) and a high level of oxygenation, perhaps provided by spray-bar returns situated above the water line and/or additional powerheads. High water quality is essential for this river-dwelling species, so partial water changes should be carried out on a very regular basis in order to keep nitrogenous waste to a minimum. Sturdy, tight fitting coverslides are requisite, as these fish are accomplished jumpers. Although gregarious in the wild, Banded Leporinus can be rather quarrelsome when maintained in small groups in aquaria. For this reason, it is necessary to keep either a single specimen, or a group of at least 8 individuals together (introduced simultaneously), as then any belligerent behaviour will be spread throughout the shoal, and no one fish will bear the continual brunt of any aggression. Tankmates could include medium-large sized peaceful cichlids (particularly rheophilic species), large characins, talking catfish (doradids) and suckermouth catfish (loricariids). Small fish will be eaten, so choose tankmates with care. Banded Leporinus are classified within the Family Anostomidae (headstanders), of which there are currently some 156 described species within 14 genera. Many species from this family swim at an oblique or head-down angle, hence the common family name of headstander.

        "care": "The Banded Tiger Loach is known from a variety of habitats including lakes, rivers, and upland streams. During the rainy season, when water depth/flow increases and the water temperature drops, they migrate into flooded areas to spawn, usually staying close to submerged trees, logs, and roots. The waterways are usually lined with riparian vegetation, and the substrate is comprised of mud/sand, water-worn cobbles, and small boulders, creating an endless labyrinth of effective hiding places. In some areas there will be fast current as water is forced past haphazard rockwork. As with all botiids, these loaches must only be added to aquariums that are biologically mature. However, unlike their close relatives, the Botia spp., the pointy-faced Syncrossus genus of loaches grow larger and are exceptionally aggressive and territorial. It is essential that a spacious aquarium is provided, and numerous hiding spots and \"\u02dcvisual barriers\"\u2122 created with driftwood, smooth rounded rocks, cobbles, and pebbles of varying sizes. Ensure that the substrate has no sharp edges as these loaches will enjoy digging around the bottom of the tank in their search for titbits of food, and it is important that nothing damages their delicate sensory barbels. Dim lighting is preferable, and a well-covered tank is a must as these loaches are expert jumpers and can escape through the smallest of openings. Powerful filtration (ideally provided by external canister/s) and a decent level of oxygenation are requisite, as are frequent partial water changes. Like other fish from riverine habitats, these loaches are intolerant of a build up of organic pollutants, so ensure that a regular partial water change schedule is in place. As mentioned above, Banded Tiger Loaches are extremely hostile towards other fish, and in the confines of the home aquarium, this can include their own kind. However, despite the hostility, they do form fascinating highly complex social structures within a group, and their physical health will suffer if they don\"\u2122t have contact with more of their own species. To this end, they should always be maintained in large groups of 8 or more. This will not only meet their social needs but it will help spread any aggression amongst the shoal, so that no one fish bears the continual brunt of the antagonistic behaviour. It is also why adequate space and visual barriers are so important. Tankmates, if desired, must be chosen with much care - only large, robust, fast-swimming species that can hold their own should be considered (large but placid species, even if larger than the loaches, will be mercilessly bullied). Some aquarists like to keep more than one species of Syncrossus loach together; this usually works well, but do make sure there are several of each species and not just single specimens. In addition to the tiger loaches, some of the Yasuhikotakia species of loach also cohabit well with Syncrossus due to their similar belligerent behaviour and environmental needs. The Banded Tiger Loach is sometimes confused with the similar looking Green Tiger Loach (S. hymenophysa). They can be told apart by the absence of a dark blotch on the dorsal fin in S. helodes (present in S. hymenophysa). S. helodes also sports a series of small dark spots on the lower half of the flanks, whereas S. hymenophysa has none.

Here the adults are found in abundance (in harems consisting of one male and several females) along the shallow banks, and over stony substrates. An aquarium for these fish should be furnished with a soft sand substrate and various smooth rocks and driftwood positioned to form caves and visual barriers. There should be calm zones as well as areas of swift current, which can be created by using powerheads and decor to create shelters from the current they create. Although Bandit Cichlids are relatively peaceful and fairly shy (except during spawning), they are not suitable for placing into a general community tank with small fish. However, they are very gregarious and should be kept in groups of 6 or more for their continued wellbeing. There may be minor territorial quarrels between males, but no real damage should ensue, particularly if there are plenty of visual barriers amongst the decor. Tankmates should be of a similar size and temperament, and not overly aggressive. Be aware that these cichlids will dig into the substrate to create caves and pits (so do ensure that the decor cannot be undermined), and therefore aquatic plants do not tend to cope very well with such behaviour, tending to become uprooted. There are several Guianacara species that are imported under the catch-all Bandit Cichlid nametag, and all have very similar requirements as detailed above. The majority that are labelled as G. geayi are actually other species. L\u00c3pez-Fern\u00c3\u00a1ndez has provided a concise pictorial key to all the species in a scientific paper, with the main diagnostic characters (in adult fish) being the mid-lateral bar, the mid-lateral spot, and the presence/absence of dark membranes on the first 3 or 4 anterior rays of the spiny dorsal fin. It is summarised as follows: G. geayi - wide midlateral bar, no midlateral spot, and no black on membranes of anterior dorsal fin rays, G. cuyunii - thin midlateral bar, no spot, black on dorsal fin membranes, G. dacrya - thin midlateral bar, midlateral spot, unique infraorbital stripe, white spots on the spiny portion of the dorsal fin, black on membranes of anterior dorsal fin rays, G. oelemariensis - no midlateral bar, spot below lateral line, black on dorsal fin membranes, G. owroewefi - wide midlateral bar, spot on and below lateral line, black on dorsal fin membranes, G. sphenozona - midlateral bar present, spot above lateral line, no black on dorsal fin membranes, G. stergiosi - thin midlateral bar, spot below lateral line, black on dorsal fin membranes.

        "care": "The Bandit Cory is beautiful catfish that is ideal for the mature softwater aquarium. This is a peaceful bottom dweller which should be maintained in groups of 5 or more due to shoaling nature. In the wild, C. melini is known from pristine blackwater tributaries of the Orinoco and upper Negro River basins, so they will always be at their best in soft, acidic water long-term. Unfortunately, this species can be a little prone to barbel infections/erosion, so it is of paramount importance that they are kept on a soft sand substrate (rather than gravel where waste can build up unseen) in order to protect these delicate sensory organs. Regular maintenance, including frequent partial water changes, should be carried out in order to keep these fish in good condition. Provide plenty of shady areas amongst driftwood, rocks, and areas of dense planting. Other peaceful species such as some of the smaller pencilfish, tetra, and rasboras make ideal tankmates, and their presence as dither fish in midwater will encourage the Corydoras out into view more often. Corydoras have the ability to breathe air intestinally, so a small gap should be left between the surface of the water and the cover slides in order for the fish to come up to the surface and take air in. It may do this numerous times per day. H. melini is similar in appearance to H. davidsandsi and H. metae, and they can be told apart as follows: in H. metae, the diagonal black stripe terminates at the caudal peduncle, but carries on into the caudal fin in both H. davidsandsi and H. melini. The same black diagonal stripe separates into two just behind the dorsal fin and continues as two lines over the back of the body in H. melini. In H. davidsandsi, the stripe separates much nearer to the caudal peduncle. The body colouration of H. davidsandsi tends to be much \"cleaner\", whereas H. melini is more of a dirty tan on account of the black specks on the edges of the body scutes.\n\nHoplisoma was recently split from Corydoras and contains many familiar species.",

Unfortunately the eggs of this species are prone to fungus, so some fishkeepers like to add a small amount of methylene blue to the breeding tank. The eggs generally take 3-4 days to hatch after which time the tiny fry should be offered finely powdered first foods. A few days later they will be able to take newly hatched brineshrimp.",

Here these secretive catfish will be found on (or buried in) the silty substrate, hiding motionless underneath dense leaf litter and fallen branches. These sedentary bottom-dwellers are best kept in a large, mature aquarium and are unfussy with regards to water chemistry providing extremes are avoided. Provide a soft sand substrate with plenty of shady hiding places amongst driftwood and rocky caves. As these fish prefer dim lighting, open expanses of sand in brightly lit tanks should be shaded with large, broad-leaved plants. These fish will usually remain partially buried during daylight hours, and the addition of dried leaf litter would further help to emulate the natural environment. However, be sure the leaves are non-toxic; Dried Indian Almond leaves (Terminalia catappa) are ideal and are readily available. The addition of some form of blue moon lighting to the aquarium - which switches on just before the main lights go out - will allow you to spend time observing them under their preferred subdued illumination. Banjo Catfish are peaceful towards their own kind and should be kept in groups. Tankmates should be of similar size and disposition, and species such as Corydoras, hatchetfish, pencilfish, and small tetras swimming around in open water may even encourage these reclusive catfish out into view a bit more. Observe carefully to ensure that none of the other fish are continually nipping away at the inactive, partially buried catfish. Good filtration along with frequent partial water changes are essential for keeping nitrogenous wastes to a minimum; however, the actual water flow within the aquarium should not be excessive.",
        "feeding": "Offer a variety of small, meaty frozen foods such as bloodworm, white mosquito larvae, black mosquito larvae, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, daphnia etc. as well as different sinking catfish pellets/granules.

        "breeding": "This species has been bred in the home aquarium, but it is a fairly rare occurrence. Adults are said to be sexually mature once they reach 11cm or so. Spawning takes place at night, with eggs scattered on the substrate. The adults will predate on the eggs, so they will need moving to another tank set up with identical water parameters. The eggs, which could number into the thousands, should hatch within 3 days. Once the young have used up their yolk sacs, they can be offered tiny foods such as baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii), microworm, and crushed catfish tablets.",

In the wild this species has a wide distribution and it is found in many heavily vegetated slow-moving bodies of water with high oxygen content. These timid fish are said to spend the brightest part of the day amongst the shady cover of the plant life, emerging during the early morning and late afternoon to feed.\n  The aquarium should replicate these conditions as closely as possible, with dark decor and heavy planting. Floating species can be useful to help diffuse the light. Water should be soft and acidic - with a gentle flow. Bogwood and Indian Almond Leaves (Terminalia catappa) can be very beneficial in releasing tannins into the water, both providing additional hiding places and imparting a more natural feel (the Indian Almond Leaves will require periodic replacement as they gradually decompose); Barilioides Barbs tend to show their best colours in tannin-stained water. This is a species that is best maintained in large groups (10+) in tanks over 3ft long. Loose shoaling will occur, but males can be a little antagonistic with each other, usually forming a hierarchy with the largest and colourful fish the most dominant. Ideally the tank will be aquascaped with so many hiding places amongst the planting and decor that visual barriers enable fish to get away from one another if needed. If the aquarium is too small or if hiding places are too sparse, the subservient males may be bullied by the dominant specimen. Having said this, Barilioides Barbs are generally very retiring and are peaceful towards other species; they should not be housed with any large, boisterous, aggressive fish. Ideal tankmates could include dwarf cichlids (Pelvicachromis sp. if you want to keep the African theme; Apistogramma or Mikrogeophagus sp. if this does not worry you), small catfish (again some of the diminutive Microsynodontis sp. for the African theme, or the South American Corydoras do make great companions), kuhli loaches etc. May also be seen on sale as African Banded Barb.",

This tank should be set up with peat-filtered softwater (pH <6.0, dH< 6) with the temperature set to 24-26 \u00b0C. Filtration must be gentle, an air driven filter is ideal. A substrate of sterilised marbles can be used, or else add a good amount of Java moss clumps. The well-conditioned pair should be carefully acclimatised to this aquarium and allowed to settle in to their new surroundings. Once ready to spawn, the female will scatter several hundred eggs, the male following behind, simultaneously fertilising them. Most of the eggs should fall to the safety of the moss/marbles, but the hungry parents should be removed as soon as spawning has ceased to prevent predation. The eggs should hatch within 36-48 hours and the fry will become free-swimming after a further few days. Infusoria should be offered as a first food, moving on to newly hatched brineshrimp as they grow. The fry are particularly sensitive to any deterioration in water quality, so excellent conditions must be maintained at all times. Ensure that any (dechlorinated) fresh water used in partial water changes is of the same temperature as the breeding aquarium water, of a similar chemistry, and added very slowly to avoid any unnecessary losses.",

Indian Almond Leaves (Terminalia catappa) are also very much appreciated as 'leaf litter', but these must be replaced on a regular basis as they gradually decompose. Lighting should be diffused with the use of floating plants, and it is also a good idea to use a blue moon light timed to come on just before the main lights go out, so that you can view the antics of these nocturnal creatures under their preferred dimly lit conditions.

Be sure that the aquarium has no gaps at the top, as these fish are great escape artists. Barred Spiny Eels are not aggressive, but adults are capable of taking small fish overnight, so tankmates must be chosen with care. Neon Tetra sized fish, for example, are not recommended. Suggested tankmates could include large Rasboras, large gouramis, rainbowfish, good sized peaceful botiid loach species, Geophagus species, L-number suckermouth cats etc. Keep only one eel per tank unless the aquarium is very spacious and has an abundance of visual barriers, in which case a group of 5+ may be kept together.

These species should only be added to a mature tank where the temperature does not exceed 25 \u00b0C.

It is important that the tank is well-filtered and has areas of decent current to help provide good levels of oxygenation. High water quality is a must, so regular partial water changes are essential. Although this is a generally considered a peaceful species, keep only one male with several females, unless the tank is more than3ft long. This is a naturally shoaling species, so it is best to purchase a goodsized group, but be aware that mature males can be surprisingly aggressive towards one another, and there will need to be adequate space, territories and visual barriers if more than one male is to be housed in the same aquarium. As the fish come into spawning condition, the aggression between males can really heighten, and they can cause great damage to each other, and this has even be known to have a fatal outcome on some occasions. This is why many fishkeepers choose to house one male with a harem of females. However, these catfish are completely peaceable towards other fish species and can be kept safely alongside other temperate species such as some of the dwarf cichlids, tetras, danios, and barbs.

These shoaling fish tend to inhabit heavily vegetated areas of sluggish tributaries, where they stay close to the safety of plant cover and submerged roots. The water is soft and acidic, and is often stained a tea-colour due to tannins released from submerged wood and decaying leaves. Ideally, the aquarium should be darkly furnished, with plenty of bogwood and areas of dense planting to emulate this habitat as closely as possible. Whilst the Bentosi Tetra is an adaptable species that will acclimatise to a wide range of conditions, this species will always look its best in soft, acidic water (peat filtration suggested) and the tank must be biologically mature. Bentosi Tetras should always be maintained in good sized groups: 6 would be the minimum recommended, 10+ would be better. Not only will the fish feel more secure, but this will result in a far more effective, natural-looking shoal. Ideally, tankmates will also be small and peaceful, and could include Corydoras catfish, hatchetfish, small dwarf cichlids such as Apistogramma or Mikrogeophagus, and some of the smaller Loricariidae (suckermouth catfish). Bentosi Tetras can be quite easily frightened, so ensure that they are not housed with boisterous species.\nFor many years, the Rosy Tetra (H. rosaceus) was thought to be a subspecies of the Bentosi Tetra. Most fish in the shops labelled as Rosy Tetra are actually H. bentosi. They are extremely difficult to tell apart but H. bentosi is said to display a negligible dark mark just behind the operculum, which is lacking in H. rosaceus.

        "care": "The Bifasciatum Cichlid is known from the Grijalva and Usumacinta River basins, where it inhabits the calmer waters of lagoons, lakes, and the lower reaches of rivers. Due to the large adult size of this fish (girth as well as length!), an aquarium measuring 6\"\u2122 x 2\"\u2122 x 2\"\u2122 is required. A group of youngsters can be grown on in a 4ft tank, but in most cases they will eventually require separating into compatible pairs and rehoming into larger quarters. Excellent powerful filtration should be provided at all times and partial water changes carried out 2 or 3 times per week. The tank itself should have a substrate of sand or small rounded gravel. Bogwood and rocks/slate can be used to create sheltered areas, but these should be made secure as these cichlids are more than capable of moving d\u00c3\u00a9cor around. Bonding pieces of rock together with aquarium grade silicon sealant prior to filling the tank is sensible. Plants are usually eaten or uprooted, but some aquarists have had success with well-rooted, established hardy motherplants which have had sturdy rocks placed around the stems to prevent uprooting. If this fails and plants are still desired, plastic or silk varieties will be the way to go. This is an aggressive species which is best maintained as an established male-female pair. They are intolerant of their own kind, but can usually be combined with other robust cichlids, if the aquarium is spacious. Not to be kept with small fish. Other Central American cichlids of a similar size and temperament make great tankmates, as do large armoured catfish. However, if breeding does occur, expect aggression towards the other fish and be prepared to separate them with a tank divider or move the other fish to another aquarium for their own safety. May also be seen on sale as the Two Stripe Cichlid.",
        "feeding": "Omnivorous. This species requires a balanced diet in order to retain good colours. Slow sinking pellets & wafers, frozen foods such as mosquito larvae, Spirulina/vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, Mysis shrimp, krill, chopped cockle, chopped mussel meat and prawns will all be taken with much enthusiasm. Be sure to provide a vegetable component to the diet, such as spinach, kale, lettuce and cucumber.",
        "breeding": "Prior to spawning, the pair will begin cleaning a potential spawning site, such as a flat piece of slate. Over 1000 eggs will be laid/fertilised, and these can be expected to hatch within 48-72 hours. The parents will protect the young, which are free-swimming after a week or so. A bonded pair will reproduce on a regular basis, and always in large numbers. Therefore, it is important to have a homing plan in place for (potentially) hundreds of juvenile fish, as they can quickly overwhelm an aquarium.",

When housing more than one adult in the same tank, it is best to source a compatible pair. Newcomers of the same species will not be tolerated by the established fish, so it is not recommended to add more at a later date. Black Belt Cichlids can usually be kept alongside other large central American species that can handle themselves; small, placid tankmates are definitely not advised. In the wild this species has a wide distribution area, and so geographical colour variations do occur. Although a river dwelling species, the Black Belt Cichlid tends to move into the lower river valleys where the current is more sluggish. Submerged tree roots along the banks provide them with shelter. When aquascaping the tank to create these conditions, ensure that any bogwood and rocks are stable, as these fish are capable of moving decor around. If plants are desired, plastic or silk varieties will have to be used, as anything green and leafy will be regarded as food. Although this species will adapt to a wide range of water conditions, they will be at their best in hard water with low nitrates - which means plenty of large water changes. Other Central American cichlids of a similar temperament make good tankmates in aquaria large enough to provide adequate territory but fast moving shoaling species will often be a better option. Once paired and spawning, expect aggression towards the other fish.",

The body colour is typically jet black but the fins are dark brown. Rather confusingly, many suppliers list the fish with the misleading name \"Corydoras venezuelanus sp. black\". This line bred black strain of O. schultzei has no Venezuelan origins and is not a variant of O. venezuelanus (which itself is another \"aeneus type\"). Misunderstanding is likely to have arisen due to the occurrence of a black wild form of O. venezuelanus - but this is not the same fish. The wild black form of O. venezuelanus has not been exported for the aquarium trade in any great numbers. If in any doubt, juvenile black C. schultzei display reddish fins which darken as they mature. The black form of O. venezuelanus, however, sport a reddish adipose and dorsal fin, but the anal, pelvic, and caudal fins are grey. This peaceful species is ideal for the mature community aquarium, and should be maintained in groups of 5 or more due to shoaling nature. Unfortunately, it can be a little prone to barbel infections/erosion, so it is of paramount importance that the fish are kept on a soft sand substrate (rather than gravel where waste can build up unseen) in order to protect these delicate sensory organs. Regular maintenance, including frequent partial water changes, should be carried out in order to keep these fish in good condition. Provide plenty of shady areas amongst driftwood, rocks, and areas of dense planting. Other peaceful species such as some of the smaller pencilfish, tetra, and rasboras make ideal tankmates, and their presence as \"dither fish\" in midwater will encourage the Corydoras out into view more often.

        "care": "The beautiful Black Crystal Bee Shrimp is one of the wild forms of Caridina cantonensis that is now captive bred en-masse for the aquarium trade. These shrimp are highly social creatures that are best maintained in large colonies. They are suitable for mature aquariums containing communities of small, peaceful fish only, as larger tankmates will regard them as a snack. Black Crystal Bee Shrimp are excellent algae eaters and will browse on many different algae types. Highly recommended for planted aquaria, they will not damage the plants, instead they will feed on any dead leaves - and large groups will also be beneficial in keeping the leaves of slower-growing species free from nuisance algae. Tall plants seem to be particularly favoured, and these shrimp can often be seen climbing and 'hanging around' in plant cover near to the water's surface. Like most species of shrimp, an elevated nitrate level will not be tolerated - ensure high standards of water quality are maintained at all times, ideally with small partial water changes performed a few times per week. Filtration should be efficient but gentle; always try to aim the output of the filter towards the surface of the water to ensure that there is a sufficient level of oxygenation (something that can be all too easily overlooked in gently filtered shrimp aquaria). Black Crystal Bee Shrimps will moult regularly whilst growing, and the sudden appearance of perfectly formed shrimp casings on the floor of the aquarium can cause alarm to fishkeepers who have not seen this before. The shrimps can sometimes be seen feeding on the casings - this is actually very nutritious for them, so do not rush to siphon them from the substrate. Once the shrimp has moulted, it will remain hidden for a time until the new shell hardens and it has a bit more protection. Be aware that these shrimp do not tend to fare well in water that is over 26 \u00b0C (79 deg F), and for greatest long term health, hard, alkaline conditions are best avoided. A grading system has evolved over time to separate Black Crystal Bee Shrimps with different intensities of colour and size/number of white patches - the higher grades commanding quite astonishing price tags from some breeders. Acclimatise these shrimps very carefully and slowly, either by drip acclimatisation or using a Maidenhead Aquatics Fintro. Black Crystal Bee Shrimps are considered somewhat delicate and so they are not recommended for beginners. Be extremely careful if using CO2 injection on planted aquaria containing these shrimps, as they will not cope with swings in pH. Although you will always hear of cases where Black Crystal Bee Shrimps have been kept in water with a higher pH or temperature, lifespan, overall health and breeding will be severely diminished under such conditions.

Supplement the diet with algae wafers, sinking pellets, crushed flake foods, small frozen foods such as daphnia, baby brineshrimp, mini-bloodworm etc., and also offer some vegetable matter such as blanched spinach or courgette. It can be beneficial to add some dried Indian almond leaves (Terminalia catappa) to the aquarium as biofilm will form on these as they slowly rot, and this provides a great source of food for the shrimps, whilst helping to maintain a low pH in the aquarium.",
        "breeding": "Black Crystal Bee Shrimps often breed freely in the home aquarium given optimal conditions. Best results occur when the water is slightly soft and acidic, and when temperature is maintained between 21-23 \u00b0C (70-73 deg F). Females may still carry eggs at the higher end of the preferred temperature range, but smaller numbers of young are produced compared to shrimps living in cooler waters. Colours also tend to be more vibrant at lower temperatures. The eggs are held underneath the female until hatching takes place (approx. 1 month), and will be visible within the abdomen. Unlike some species, the young do not go through a larval stage and, are instead, born as miniature replicas of the adult shrimp. On hatching, the offspring will be coloured black and white just like their parents, however, actual grading cannot be performed until they develop further with age, when the quality of features will be easier to determine. Many aquarists like to cover the intakes of power filters with fine sponges to prevent the tiny youngsters from being drawn in.",

It is a very adaptable species which has been found in a number of different habitats and environmental conditions, from freshwater to lightly brackish, and with vastly differing water temperatures.\nIn the home aquarium, the Black Diamond Cichlid is best kept singly or as an established male-female pair. They are generally peaceful towards other robust cichlid species, but are intolerant of their own kind, particularly in smaller aquaria. Due to the adult size of this fish, a spacious aquarium is required. A group of youngsters can be grown on in a smaller tank, but in most cases they will eventually require separating into compatible pairs and rehoming into larger quarters. Powerful filtration should be provided at all times and partial water changes carried out on a regular basis; little and often is best, as Black Diamond Cichlids are sensitive to the changes in water parameters that larger water changes might bring. The tank itself should have a substrate of sand or small rounded gravel. Bogwood and rocks/slate can be used to create sheltered areas, but these should be made secure as these cichlids are more than capable of moving decor around. Bonding pieces of rock together with aquarium grade silicon sealant prior to filling the tank is sensible. Plants can be incorporated into the aquascape, but there is a risk they may be uprooted if a pair decides to spawn. Some aquarists have had success with well-rooted, established hardy motherplants which have had sturdy rocks placed around the stems to prevent uprooting. If this fails and plants are still desired, species such as Anubias or Java Fern (Microsorum spp.) can be tied on and trained to grow on the decor. Although this species will adapt to a wide range of water conditions, they must be acclimatised carefully. Outside of spawning, these fish are not especially aggressive, although small fishes and shrimps will be eaten. Barbs, large tetras and other cichlids of a similar size and temperament make great tankmates. However, if spawning behaviour does occur, expect aggression towards the other fish as these cichlids demand a large breeding territory which could encompass most of the aquarium. \nAs with many Madagascan species, this fish is vulnerable to habitat destruction in the wild and a few forms are held in conservation programmes. The fish previously know as P. bleekeri is now considered a form of polleni, giving rise to 'large spot' and 'small spot' forms which should not be cross bred. Paratilapia are considered to be amongst the most primitive cichlids and their uniqueness should be preserved.",

        "breeding": "Bi-parental substrate spawners. Several days prior to spawning, an elaborate courtship ritual will begin with the male fish taking on intense dark colouration and displaying to the female. They will then dig a large depression in the substrate ready for spawning. If there are other fish present in the tank, the Black Diamond Cichlids will become aggressive at this point, and unless the tank is very spacious, the tankmates are best moved to another aquarium. The female will deposit her eggs in the large pit or in a hollow in the decor. The eggs each have a long sticky filament attached to them, and these attach to other eggs and form strings of hundreds of eggs, which the male fertilises. Up to 1000 eggs may be deposited and these are cared for by the female, whilst the male guards the perimeter. As the female fans the eggs, the strings may fold onto themselves and form a larger mass. The eggs should hatch within 48 hours and the wrigglers will become free-swimming after 4-5 days. They are large enough to take baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) at this point. The parents will protect the fry for up to a month later, but should be separated after this point. The fry, if of different sizes, may need separating into groups by size to avoid aggression.",

        "care": "The Black diamond stingray is known only from the Rio Xingu and Rio Fresco, where it is found in shallow, slow-moving tributaries over sandy or muddy substrates. This stunningly beautiful bottom-dweller grows very large, and requires a voluminous aquarium with powerful filtration to match. The length and width of the tank is generally much more important than the height, giving this fish as much floor space as possible and allowing for the fish to turn freely with the long tail. The aquarium must be biologically mature before adding this species. A soft sand substrate is essential, as stingrays spend the majority of their time on the bottom and like to bury themselves in the substrate from time to time (with just the eyes protruding), as well as searching out food items on the sand. When resting on or in the substrate, small openings located on the top of the head (known as spiracles) draw water into the gill chambers to facilitate oxygen exchange. Decor is not overly necessary for stingrays, as a large expanse of sand is much more important for their continued wellbeing. Some tangles of driftwood and smooth rocks could be incorporated, but these must be very secure, and not take up very much of the floor space. The stingrays are voracious eaters that produce a lot of waste, and require excellent water conditions. To this end, filtration must be powerful and the water well-oxygenated. A frequent partial water change regime is absolutely essential as this fish will not tolerate an elevated nitrate level. Several huge canister filters can be employed, but sump filtration may be more prudent as then equipment such as heaters can be kept in the sump and out of the main tank where they would be very easily damaged. Lighting should be fairly dim, as these fish do not enjoy bright illumination. Stingrays are not particularly sociable and are best maintained either singly, as a male/female pair, or one male with a group of females. Male fish can be rather rough with one another, so it's best to house only one male per tank. Tankmates (if desired) must be chosen very carefully, as stingrays are highly proficient predators; however, despite this, they will fail to thrive if housed with boisterous or territorial species. The best companions would be large, passive midwater or surface-dwelling fish. Avoid keeping with Loricariids (suckermouth catfish) as within the confines of the home aquarium, there are many documented instances of them attaching themselves and rasping away at the flat, disc-shaped body of stingrays, causing injury. Ensure the tank has tight fitting coverslides that are weighted down, as these fish are expert jumpers. Take extra care when offering food, as it is not unusual for the stingray to swim up and breach the water's surface during all the excitement of a feeding frenzy. Like all species from this genus, P. leopoldi is equipped with one or more barbed spines that are found on the dorsal surface of the middle section of the tail. These spines are coated with an extremely toxic mucus that inflicts very painful wounds, and tends to be employed in defence or when the fish is alarmed. Always handle stingrays with much care. When these fish need to be moved, they should always be herded into a solid container, rather than using a net. If you are stung by a Potamotrygon spp. stingray, seek immediate medical help for pain relief and to ensure no part of the stinging spine remains in the wound (this could lead to a serious secondary infection). These fish shed their stingers every 2-3 months and new ones grow in their place. Be aware that discarded stingers can remain venomous for some time, so exercise caution when carrying out tank maintenance. This fish is long-lived (20+ years) and a fascinating species to look after, but it is quite the commitment so do ensure that all of its specific care requirements can be met before purchase. May also be seen on sale as the Leopoldi stingray, Polka dot stingray, White-blotched river stingray, or Xingu River ray. You may also see hybrids, some of which have distinctive names relating to their markings.",
        "feeding": "Juveniles can be offered bloodworm, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, Mysis shrimp, and chopped krill. Adults should be offered larger foodstuffs such as cockles, mussels, prawns, river shrimp, silversides, whitebait, and pieces of white fish flesh. Stingrays have a fast metabolism and require feeding 2-3 times per day (which is why powerful filtration and a strict water change regime is absolutely essential).",
        "breeding": "The Black diamond Stingray has been bred in the home aquarium, and like other Potamotrygon spp. reproduces via a breeding strategy known as matrotrophic viviparity. Stingrays can take a long time to become sexually mature, so patience may be required, particularly if starting out with fairly young fish. As the courtship ritual can be a somewhat violent affair, it is better if the female is larger than the male so that she can defend herself adequately from the male's advances, which includes incessant chasing and rough biting. Always observe carefully just in case the female is not receptive, as the fish may need separating for safety reasons. When ready to spawn, the pair briefly go belly-to-belly, with the male inserting one of his claspers into the female's cloaca, fertilisation taking place internally. Gestation usually lasts 2-3 months, and a typical sized litter would number between 1 and 8 (the young often referred to as 'pups'). The pups develop inside the mother, nourished by secretions from her villi (umbilical filaments), and when they are born, they are fully-formed miniatures of the adults. It is essential that the female receives good, nutritious feedings during the gestation period as she will expend a lot of energy when carrying and nourishing her pups. Once the pups are born, it may be best to move them carefully to other quarters, as although predation is rare, it is not unheard of. There is also the matter of the water becoming very clouded during the birth when bodily fluids are released, so the main tank will require a large water change (which the pups might be sensitive to). The pups will feed from their yolk sacs for the first week or so, after which time they can be offered a variety of small meaty frozen foods. A compatible pair of stingrays may attempt to breed regularly, and as this can be rather hard on the female, it may be best to separate the pair after every couple of litters, in order for her to recover properly and have a rest from such an energy-intensive process.",

        "care": "The Black Ghost Knifefish is known from rapidly flowing creeks with sandy substrates. This nocturnal oddball is a micro-predator of insect larvae and small fish, and possesses a weakly discharging neurogenic electric organ and ampullary electro receptors that are distributed from head to tail. This means that the fish can not only sense electrical impulses, but can send them as well. These electrosensory systems are used mainly for electro-location, navigation, and communication, and are relatively weak as electric fish go, so pose no risk to the aquarist. This is a endearing fish which is an all over inky black colour except for a white patch on the dorsal surface of the nose/head and two white rings on the slender tail. It moves in a graceful manner by undulating the long anal fin - which stretches the length of the belly, from just under the base of the pectoral fins to the caudal peduncle - and is capable of swimming forwards or backwards with ease. The Black Ghost Knifefish is reasonably easy to keep, provided that some key requirements are met. Firstly, this fish grows very large and cannot really bend, so a voluminous aquarium (at least 6ft long and a minimum 2.5ft wide) is a must. Secondly, the knifefish must be provided with a choice of shady hiding spots e.g. wide PVC tubes, rocky caves/overhangs (do ensure such structures are stable), and large tangles of driftwood. The lighting should not be too bright as these nocturnal fish are sensitive to intense illumination; if the tank must be brightly lit in some areas, provide plenty of broad leaved aquatic plants and floating species to help diffuse the light. Nonetheless, there absolutely must be areas of darkness within the tank that the fish can retreat to during the day as necessary. The substrate should consist of soft sand in order that the fish may grub about safely when searching for food, and so that the delicate anal fin does not become torn in any sharp gravel. Decent filtration, and moderate levels of flow and oxygenation are required, along with a consistent maintenance regime encompassing regular partial water changes, as these fish are sensitive to elevated nitrate and sudden changes in water chemistry. Black Ghost Knifefish are generally peaceful with other fish (which are large enough not to be eaten overnight), but they are territorial with their own kind and other knifefish, so should be kept one to a tank and not with any other knifefish species. There is also the added problem that in the confines of the home aquarium, electrogenic fish can sometimes become stressed by the presence of other such species due to their electrical fields overlapping. Tankmates should be of similar temperament and large enough not to be considered a snack; good companions could include angelfish, eartheaters (Geophagus spp.), medium sized gouramis, large rainbowfish etc. Avoid housing with any aggressive or boisterous species, and do not attempt to keep alongside snails or shrimps as these would be predated upon. When first introduced to the aquarium, the Black Ghost Knifefish is often very shy, but over time, it will gain confidence - indeed, some specimens may become so tame that they may take food from the hand of the aquarist, or even sit in the hand itself whilst feeding. Blue moon lighting, timed to come on just before the main lights switch off in the evening, is useful in observing your knifefish for a few hours under its preferred subdued lighting. Hopefully, if the tank is maintained appropriately and new fish are quarantined carefully before adding the main aquarium, the need for medications should not arise. However, if treatment is required, take much care as these fish are classed as 'scaleless' and are particularly sensitive to medications (always check with the manufacturer before using - some treatments are not safe, and others may need half dosing). Many aquarists also find that running a UV steriliser on the tank helps to eliminate pathogens and safeguards against the need for putting treatment in the water. The scientific name Apteronotus is from the Greek 'apteros' (without wings) and 'noton' (back) in allusion to the lack of dorsal fin. This is a long-lived and fascinating species to look after, but this fish is quite a commitment so do ensure  that all of its specific care requirements can be met before purchase.",

        "breeding": "Black Ghost Knifefish have not been bred in the home aquarium - this is likely because most aquarists can only house one per tank due to their territorial nature. However, aquaculture farms in Indonesia are breeding this species en-masse in large outdoor tropical ponds.",

Black Kuhli Loaches will very much appreciate areas of dense planting, where they can congregate and literally \"hang around\" together. In the wild, these fish live amongst the leaf litter in sluggish waterways, and many aquarists find that keeping - and regularly replacing - dried Indian Almond Leaves (Terminalia catappa) on the bottom of their aquarium provides these fish with natural hiding places and conditions. If housing smaller specimens, be sure to protect them from any filter or powerhead intakes as they do like to try and squeeze into tiny nooks and crannies. Black Kuhli Loaches are a peaceful species and do well in quieter tanks with tankmates of a similar disposition. There are many different Pangio species living in south east Asia, a fair number of which are exported in the aquatics trade, and often misidentified.

The more hiding places that are provided, the more the catfish is likely to venture out and about, as it will get to know it has safe places to quickly retreat to if it feels the need.

        "care": "The Black Moor is a selectively bred strain and is a black variety of a breed referred to as a telescope or dragon-eyed goldfish. Domesticated goldfish date back to China\"\u2122s Ming dynasty and Fancy goldfish have long been popular aquarium pets, although often as a first venture into keeping an aquarium. This is a mixed blessing, as there are far better choices for small aquaria than these big, messy fishes. Given appropriate housing and care, fancy goldfish can attain a large size and easily live for more than 15-20 years. The aquarium should be spacious and ideally around 1.2 metres long to allow room for 30cm adults to be comfortable. The length and width of the tank are much more important than the height in this respect.\nFancy goldfish grow quickly so it is best to provide them with the largest aquarium that you can from the outset to provide a much safe, stable environment for them. The larger the volume of water, the more stable it will be in terms of water chemistry and temperature. During the warmer months, these fish can be kept outside in raised water features suitably filtered and protected from predators. This can be a great way to provide extra room for your pets and they\"\u2122ll benefit from the semi-natural conditions. Like any goldfish, fancies will benefit from a seasonal drop in temperature and this can be provided by either moving them indoors in late autumn, or positioning their aquarium in a room that experiences cool room temperatures during the winter. Fancy goldfish are notoriously messy fish; they are voracious eaters and continually stir up the substrate in their ongoing search for food. Such considerable amounts of waste can lead to water quality issues in smaller aquaria if not monitored very closely. Efficient filtration that can handle copius solids is essential, and weekly partial water changes are advised in order to keep nitrate to a minimum. The water should be well-oxygenated (of particular importance during warmer spells of weather) and this is easily achieved by the use of spray-bar returns from filters or the use of an air pumps. Various species of robust plants can be added to the aquarium, but these will likely require periodic replacement due to them being uprooted/eaten - something most goldfish keepers accept and allow their fish to take pleasure in. The substrate can consist of rounded fine gravel or sand, and decor can include smooth rocks and ornaments with no sharp edges. Moors are sociable creatures and should be kept in groups, either with their own kind or with other varieties of fancy goldfish. It is best, however, to avoid keeping the standard 'single-tailed' common goldfish alongside the fancy varieties as the common goldfish is a faster swimmer and may outcompete the fancies at feeding time. Several colour varieties of these Telescope-eyed fishes are available, including blue, chocolate, red, red and white, red cap, white, yellow, and calico.",
        "feeding": "Due to their body shape, these fish need a high fibre diet and digestive problems are often the cause of buoyancy issues as transit times are compromised by convoluted digestive tracts. Goldfish also tend to swallow air in their rush to feed which also leads to problems which are best avoided by the use of sinking foods. These can be in the form of pellets, sticks or flake presented beneath the water surface. Frozen foods or live foods such as bloodworm, Mysis, and Daphnia will provide fibre and can be fed extensively to individuals displaying issues that are often categorised as Swim Bladder Disease. The opportunity to browse on aquatic plants will help to ensure gut health.",
        "breeding": "Well-conditioned fancy goldfish will often spawn in the home aquarium. Female fish will be noticeably rounder bellied when full of eggs, and the male fish will develop spawning tubercles (tiny raised bumps) on the gill plates and pectoral fins. A large, slightly cooler water change is often enough to trigger ready pairs into spawning. As the temperature slowly rises back up to its usual level, the male will pursue the female around the aquarium, but generally in a non-aggressive manner. This courtship ritual may last more than a day before spawning commences, and the colours of the fish often intensify at this time. The male fish will nudge the female into the fine-leaved plants (or spawning mops), where she will then scatter eggs which the male simultaneously fertilises. Spawning can last for a number of hours, and several thousand adhesive eggs may be scattered over the plants/spawning mop. The adults will be hungry and will start to devour as many eggs as they can find, so are best moved to another aquarium. The eggs take 4-5 days to hatch, depending on water temperature. Young fancy goldfish are often brown in colour (like their ancestors) and it can take up to a year before full colouration becomes apparent. Fancy goldfish often produce young that differ from their parents - high quality fish that show the best attributes of their breed are normally in the minority, hence the differences in price and quality between fish.",

        "care": "The Black Morpho Tetra has a widespread distribution throughout the upper Solimaes, upper Negro, and upper Orinoco River basins. Here, it is found in sluggish forest streams with dense marginal vegetation and an abundance of submerged roots and leaf litter. The water in the native habitat is soft and acidic, and stained a tea colour from the tannins in the decaying leaves and wood. The aquarium should be mature, spacious, and furnished with a dark sandy substrate, tangles of driftwood, and areas of dense planting. The driftwood will create lots of shady areas/visual barriers, and the tannins that are gradually released should help to acidify the water whilst giving it a natural, clear tea-colour. Peat filtration can also help in this respect, as would the addition of some dried Indian Almond Leaves (Terminalia catappa) on the substrate, but these will require periodic replacement. Unlike the vast majority of small characins, the Black Morpho Tetra is not a shoaling species; instead, the males are territorially aggressive towards one another. For this reason it is best to keep several females to every male, and ensure there are plenty of broken lines-of-sight amongst the decor so that rival males can retreat if necessary. Such displays are dazzling, with the males showing their best colours as they vie for female attention, and in spacious quarters with a multitude of hiding places, no harm should ensue. However, it is important to allow around 30cm x 30cm of territory per male, so the more males you wish to keep, the larger the tank must be if fin damage is to be avoided. These delicate fish occupy the mid-lower level of the aquarium, and will be at their best in a species-only set-up, but if tankmates are desired, opt for other small characins such as Carnegiella, Copella, Hemigrammus, Hyphessobrycon, Moenkhausia, or Nannostomus spp. that occupy the mid-upper levels, along with small loricariids such as Otocinclus spp. Other benthic species are best avoided due to territorial competition.

Each male will select a territory containing a cave and will defend the area from its rivals, whilst taking on intense nuptial colouration and developing white tips to the pelvic fins. Female fish that are ready to spawn may darken in appearance and will be noticeably fuller bellied. During courtship, the female will deposit eggs on the roof or side of the chosen cave, and these are then fertilised and guarded by the male. The eggs should hatch with 3-5 days, and once free-swimming, can be offered baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and microworm.

Whether tinted blackwater or clear, these habitats tend to feature running water and the cover of waterlogged debris or aquatic plants. The bold white and black lines serve to keep fish in contact with one another in turbid water and although they often occur alongside other tetras they will usually shoal discreetly in aquaria, making them a great contrast to other tetras such as Cardinals.\nWild fish tend to live in soft, acidic water but their domestic relatives are happy to live in mature tap water in most parts of the country as long as extremes are avoided. As a sociable shoaling species, they should always be kept in groups of at least six or more, with large shoals being particularly impressive where space allows.\nAlthough the familiarity of this fish makes it easy to overlook, Black neons are an excellent choice for biotope aquaria or aquascapes where the impact of a monochrome shoal serves to highlight the beauty of the planting. Peaceful in a community aquarium, adults are bulky enough to combine with species likely to eat smaller tetras but care should be taken when mixing smaller juveniles with larger tankmates.\nAs well as the commonly seen wild form and an albino version, the Brilliant or Diamond strain may be encountered. This variety lacks the white stripe but has more reflective scales in the head region.",

After a time, a male will swim in front of a female, displaying to her. He will then begin to drive the female over the plants, utilising the whole length of the tank. The relatively large eggs will be scattered over the plants a few at a time, usually totalling around 20-30 per day. These fish are known as 'continual spawners' which means that the spawning activity takes place over several days/weeks. This can present problems to the aquarist in that some adult fish may begin to consume the eggs as they are scattered, although this may not be a problem if the adults are kept well fed. However, many fishkeepers have found the eggs to be remarkably tough and have had great success in siphoning them out into another aquarium (containing matching water from the spawning tank) or else using spawning mops, which, when having caught a number of the eggs, can be moved to a separate tank (again with matching water) and replaced with a new mop, as and when each series of eggs are deposited.

These fast-swimmers grow very quickly and before long will require an aquarium measuring at least 6\" x 2\" x 2\" (and preferably larger). They must have company of their own kind, so 6 specimens would be considered the absolute minimum number to house together; not only is this a tightly shoaling species, but an instinctive hierarchy system will develop amongst their group. Larger groups will not only help to make them feel much more secure, but will result in a much more effective, natural looking shoal. The aquarium itself should be sited in a quiet location where it does not receive a large amount of continual foot traffic going past. These are very skittish fish that are easily startled, so they must be provided with many shady hiding spots within the aquarium and some very tight fitting coverslides to prevent them from accidentally jumping out. D\u00c3\u00a9cor must be chosen with care as anything sharp can cause them injury whenever they decide to make a dash for cover. When cleaning the aquarium, much care must be taken to ensure that the fish do not become too startled. Black-barred Myleus are largely herbivorous and possess powerful dentition - they can actually inflict a rather painful bite. Most plant species will be devoured, however, some of the more robust species such as Java Fern or Anubias can sometimes be successful; otherwise you may wish to opt for plastic or silk varieties. Lighting should be subdued and the water well-filtered and oxygenated. These fish originate from heavily vegetated tropical rivers with a fair amount of current, so a good flow rate should be provided. Excellent water quality must be maintained at all times, as they are sensitive to elevated nitrate levels. These nervous fish should not be housed with any small (bite-sized) or aggressive species. Large suckermouth catfish, doradids, or jumbo Brochis spp. all make great companions. This fish is sometimes confused with the Red Hook Metynnis (Myloplus rubripinnis) but they can be told apart by the black vertical bar on the flanks of Myleus schomburgkii, which is always absent in Myloplus rubripinnis. This black bar may be quite indistinct when the fish are juveniles (as in the one pictured here) but this marking widens and becomes much more of an obvious and attractive dark crescent as the fish mature.

The natural habitat of this species are the clear fast-flowing waters of the Mekong basin, where the substrate is sandy, the water temperature relatively cool, and the oxygen saturation levels high. This environment should be simulated as closely as possible in the home aquarium with the tank (at least 4ft long) being filtered via good sized external filter/s and extra powerheads added to create strong currents. The substrate should consist of soft sand or fine rounded gravel in order to protect the delicate sensory barbels, with flat stones, cobbles, rocky caves and bogwood pieces all added in to create a river bed effect. The addition of such decor will also provide much appreciated shady hiding spots and areas of slightly calmer water for the fish to retreat to should they feel the need. Plants can also be used, but they must be of a robust nature in order to cope with the fast flow and high O2 levels. The addition of a blue moon light to the aquarium will be beneficial for observations, as Black Lined Loaches are often more active in the evenings and feel much more comfortable venturing out under dimmer lighting. As for all Botiine loaches, partial water changes should be carried out on a regular frequent basis in order to prevent the build up of nitrates. Tankmates should be of a peaceful nature and also suited to a high-flow environment with slightly cooler-than-average temperatures.

Soft, acidic water is essential, and this can be helped along with the addition of peat to the aquarium filter. Dark decor and plenty of bogwood, caves, and planting - including floating species - will all help these fish to feel secure. It is imperative that the tank has tight fitting coverslides as these fish are highly skilled jumpers; and do ensure there are no escape holes where equipment feeds into the tank (block any gaps with filter sponge). Black-winged Hatchetfish are a timid shoaling species, which congregate in large numbers in nature; for this reason, they must be kept in groups of 6 or more (10+ is better) in order to feel secure and display natural behaviour. Tankmates must be small and peaceful, as Black-winged Hatchetfish are easily intimidated. Good companions could include small peaceable tetras, pencilfish, Corydoras catfish, dwarf cichlids such as Apistogramma or Mikrogeophagus,  and some of the smaller Loricariidae (suckermouth catfish).

They are likely to reproduce in a very similar fashion to that of the Marbled Hatchetfish, which has been bred in the home aquarium (although this is not easily accomplished). Unless your fish are kept in a species-only tank, it would be best to set up a separate aquarium for the purposes of breeding. Soft, acidic water is essential. The fish should be well-conditioned on a diet of small fruitflies and black mosquito larvae, and following a lengthy courtship ritual, eggs should be laid on floating plants or plants growing near the water's surface. The parents will predate on the eggs/fry, so they should be acclimatised back to the main aquarium once spawning has ceased. Once the eggs have hatched, and the fry have become free-swimming a few days later, they can be offered infusoria and paramecium, moving on to baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) as they grow.",

The surface of the water should be visibly moving to ensure that there is a very high amount of oxygenation within the water at all times. An additional air-pump is also a handy back-up. Without such a high level of oxygenation and water movement, Blockhead Cichlids will not fare well at all. These fish should really only be added to aquariums that are fully mature. Such tanks will have a good established growth of algae on the decor for the fish to graze upon in order to consume the micro-organisms within. Lighting should be fairly bright in order to encourage a decent amount of algal growth. Ideally, the aquarium will be at least 36\" long, and contain a multitude of hiding spots amongst rocks, cobbles and bogwood. As these cichlids like to dig, provide a sand substrate and ensure all decor is secure and rocks are placed on the aquarium base (rather than on top of the substrate) so that they cannot be undermined. Flat smooth rocks should be placed in the path of the flow, where these fish will often congregate just as they would do in their natural boulder-strewn habitats. Be sure to incorporate a number of quieter resting areas out of the path of direct flow too. Plants can be included in the river style aquarium, but not all species will fare well under fast current. Having said this, many aquarists have had a good deal of success with Anubias species and Java fern (Microsorum sp.) tied and trained to grow on the decor. Plants are not found in great abundance in the natural habitat of Blockhead Cichlids, so are not considered essential, but they will help with water quality and will make the aquarium look more aesthetically pleasing. Blockhead Cichlids are territorial and best maintained as a male-female pair - they should not be kept with any other cichlid species. Tankmates could include some of the African tetra species or Synodontis catfish. These characterful cichlids are unusual in that they spend a lot of time hopping about on the bottom of the aquarium, in much the same manner as gobies.

If ready to spawn, they will choose a suitable cave, either one that already exists amongst the decor, or they will excavate one themselves. Spawning is a rather secretive affair and will take place inside the cave. Up to 150 eggs will be deposited on the cave walls/ceiling, and these should hatch in 4-7 days (temperature dependent). It takes a further 5-7 days for the young to become free swimming, and they will be herded around the aquarium by the parents whilst they search for food. The parent fish are fiercely protective, and if there are other fish in the tank, they will attack them if they venture too close to the fry. The parents will guard their fry for up to 3 months, or until they have their next brood. Even when the parents are protecting a new brood, any previous young that are still in the aquarium are usually tolerated. Blockhead Cichlids pair for life, and if one of the pair dies, it is very rare for the remaining fish to partner up again.",

This adaptable species is very popular in the fishkeeping hobby on account of its beautiful colours, relatively peaceful temperament, and its willingness to reproduce so readily in the home aquarium. A tank measuring a minimum of 4ft long would be suitable for a pair of these fish, and should be set up with a soft, sandy substrate and tangles of driftwood. Hardy plants can be included, but as these fish are enthusiastic diggers, it would be better to opt for species such as Anubias and Microsorum, which can be trained to grow on pieces of driftwood rather than those which root in the substrate itself. Floating plants are also a good addition to help diffuse the lighting. Filtration should be efficient, ideally an external canister to cope with the amount of substrate digging and the fair amount of waste that these fish produce. Good water quality should be provided at all times to ensure the continued wellbeing of these delightful fish \" a high nitrate level makes them more prone to health problems, and is so easily avoided. Although Blue Acaras are relatively peaceful - except during spawning when the pair will become territorial towards other fish - they are not suitable for placing into a general community tank with small fish. They can, however, be kept with larger \"deeper-bodied\" characins, or, if the aquarium is 6ft+ long, other medium-sized peaceful South/Central American cichlid species such as Severums or Firemouths (this will only work if enough space/territories are provided). Small, peaceful bottom-dwellers such as Corydoras catfish may suffer a hard time of things when the Blue Acaras are with young and being very protective, so are probably best avoided. XL Brochis species and suckermouth catfish (Loricariids) would make good companions.\nThe silver-trimmed European bred fish are significantly different to the orange-trimmed ones produced by Asian breeders, which may hint at some hybridisation being a factor. A selectively bred 'electric blue' form is also available.

The female will lay a row of eggs on the chosen substrate, before moving away and allowing the male to move over the eggs and fertilise them; this is repeated over and over until up to 300 eggs are laid and fertilised. Both male and female guard the eggs, which will hatch in approximately 48 hours, and will continue to defend and look after the fry for a fortnight or so. Once the young are free swimming (usually around 7 days post hatch), they can be offered infusoria, baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and powdered fry foods, moving on to larger foodstuffs as they grow.

Here the waters are clear but tea coloured - a result of the tannins being released from decaying leaves that have fallen from the forest canopy above, rendering the conditions soft and acidic. The aquarium that houses Blue Emperor Tetras should be furnished with plenty of driftwood to create lots of shady areas, and the tannins that are gradually released from the wood should help to acidify the water whilst giving it a natural, clear tea-colour. Peat filtration can also help in this respect. Although plants are not found in abundance in the natural waters of this species, a moderate amount of planting will be appreciated and will help to make the fish feel more secure. Lighting should not be too bright (tannins and floating plants can help to diffuse brighter lighting), and darker substrate and background choices will help to show off their delightful colours. Unfortunately, Blue Emperor Tetras do have a rather underserved reputation for fin-nipping. This type of behaviour only really manifests when they are not maintained in sufficient numbers and when there are not enough visual barriers amongst the d\u00c3\u00a9cor. This species should always be maintained in good sized groups of around 10 or more specimens. Not only will the fish feel more secure, but it will result in far less hostility between the males, plus it will create a much more effective and natural-looking display. Tankmates should be small and peaceful, and could include Corydoras catfish, small dwarf cichlids such as Apistogramma or Mikrogeophagus, pencilfish, and some of the smaller Loricariidae (suckermouth catfish). Avoid large, boisterous tankmates as these tetras are easily intimidated.

The temperature should be set at the higher end of their preferred range, and lighting kept subdued. Spawning mops or clumps of Java moss should be placed on the bottom of the aquarium, and small groups of well-conditioned males and females (or even just a single male-female pair) carefully acclimatised across. The fish should spawn the following morning, with just a few eggs scattered at a time, over the course of several hours. The adults are non-guarders and should be removed after spawning to prevent predation on the eggs. Some aquarists like to use a fine mesh in the tank so that the scattered eggs can fall to safety, away from the attention of the adult fish. The eggs should hatch within 24-36 hours (depending on temperature of the water), with the fry becoming free-swimming some 3-4 days later. They should be offered infusoria as a first food, moving on to baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and microworm as they grow.",

Males are inclined to be rather competitive with one another and show the marbled pattern seen in other forms such as the Opaline, when at their most assertive. These fish have long been used as a larger accent fish amongst smaller shoaling species and the key to successful cohabitation is to keep them occupied. Although gouramis are often sold as pairs, these are not monogamous fish and males will court females in the knowledge that they'd leave his territory if they weren't interested. In the confines of an aquarium this is not an option, so add multiple females to spread the male's attention. The sexes can be easily distinguished by the shape of their dorsal fin - small and rounded in females, long and pointed in males. As this fish comes in many colour forms such as Blue, Opaline, Three-spot, Gold and White (a very pale strain of gold) these can all be mixed if you so desire. To allow them to avoid one another on occasion, the aquarium should be over 90cm/36\"\u009d in length, with a good amount of aquatic planting to provide shelter and break the sightlines.

These fish will spend a lot of their time hanging against these rocky walls, and the males will defend their chosen caves. Paracyprichromis nigripinnis are relatively peaceful and are best kept either in a species-only tank, or else with other Tanganyikan cichlids of a similar size and disposition, and with similar dietary needs. Some of the Cyprichromis species make good companions as they tend to occupy a different area of the aquarium, staying further out in mid-water. It is best to keep a group of at least 8 Paracyprichromis nigripinnis, with one male and several females. If two males are kept in the confines of the same tank, they are likely to argue. Hence we would recommend that either one male is kept, or several. This will help to spread out any possible aggression. Wherever possible, outnumber each male with 3 or more females. This does mean that if you plan on keeping more than one male, you will require a more spacious aquarium to accommodate the larger group which will consist largely of females. These fish are easily stressed, so care should be taken when catching, transporting, and acclimatising them to a new aquarium. Excellent water conditions must be maintained at all times, with plenty of frequent partial water changes to keep nitrates at a minimum. Add new (dechlorinated) water slowly and ensure it is of a similar temperature to that of the tank water.

Here it occupies the intermediate zone, being most commonly seen near the rock-sand interface, where it feeds on sand-dwelling invertebrates. It belongs to the Peacock group of cichlids. The aquarium should be at least 4ft long and aquascaped with open expanses of sand in addition to a few rocky areas. Decor such as ocean rock can be used to build sturdy structures which stretch from the base of the tank to near the surface of the water. These structures should be built with the purpose of creating many crevices for the fish to explore but constructed in such a way so as to keep the rocks stable if the fish start to dig around and underneath them. Although a substrate of coral sand or Aragonite is often recommended to help to keep the water hard and alkaline, Peacocks feel safer and show better colours over a darker substrate. The Aragonite or coral sand can always be placed into a mesh bag and kept inside the external filter for buffering purposes. This is a relatively peaceful species (as far as Malawi cichlids are concerned), however, whilst it may be tempting to add more of the colourful males than females to your setup, this is unnatural for a Peacock colony and will result in territorial disputes and stress. The ideal combination would be one or two males with a larger group (5+) of females. This species can be kept successfully alongside midwater Haps such as Copadichromis, Cyrtocara, Placidochromis etc and some of the more easygoing Mbuna (such as Labidochromis caeruleus). However, it should be the only Peacock species in the aquarium in order to avoid hybridisation.",

They will circle each other in a head to tail manner a number of times, until the female deposits her eggs. These are deposited just one or two at a time and after doing so, she immediately turns around and picks them up. At the same time, the male will rotate so that he is almost on his side, at the same time shaking and extending his anal fin, releasing his milt. The female sees the egg spots on the male's anal fin and attempts to pick up those \"eggs\" whilst she is picking up the real ones that she deposited, and at the same time taking in milt. This is the method of fertilisation, and this ritual may go on for some hours. The eggs may be incubated for around 3 weeks until they hatch and the resultant fry held for a further few days afterwards.",

This is linked to the extreme cold in parts of its native range and this tolerance is seen in their colourful descendants, as Orfe will feed and function in much colder water than Koi or Goldfish. This preference for oxygen-rich water means that these fish can struggle in small ponds with slow-moving water and are renowned for jumping from ponds during summer storms. The fact that these active fish don't eat plants and are seldom affected by disease made them very popular with pond keepers for decades, until their place was usurped by the more friendly and colourful Koi carp. Orfe still make an excellent choice for large ponds that have good water movement but are too shallow for carp, or where lush planting is desired. If this includes a waterfall or stream then they'll be very happy as this will help keep oxygen levels high overnight when submerged plants are busy producing CO2.\nThe active nature of these sociable fish makes them popular with keepers who enjoy watching them leaping for insects in summer and cruising in active shoals, but this activity can make other fishes such as koi a bit more nervous. Large specimens are also predatory enough to make an impact on small fish, although they will ignore anything too large to swallow. Insects are eagerly taken and young fishes have an insatiable appetite for mosquito larvae, driven by a rapid growth rate. Although hardy, orfe are susceptible to the heavy metals sometimes found in tap water and certain fish medications. For this reason, a water conditioner should always be used when adding new water and care should be taken in choosing a safe remedy should you need to treat your pond. Fishes exposed to these chemicals often survive but develop a permanently kinked spine.\nThe blue form is the most recently developed and is usually offered alongside the popular gold form, as well as the more rarely seen wild 'silver' type.

These beautifully coloured suckermouth catfish are found amongst  the interstices of granite bedrock and boulders that line the waterways, where they feed on periphyton and associated microfauna that are abundant on the surfaces of the rocks. The water in these areas is forced past the rocks at speed and is highly saturated with oxygen. An aquarium for these fish should be mature, with a soft sand substrate and various pieces of smooth rockwork and bogwood arranged to create lots of shady caves and crevices. There should be brisk water movement and a high level of oxygenation, perhaps provided by a river-tank manifold or powerheads (in addition to the current generated by the filtration). These small, shy bottom-dwellers require warmer than average water temperatures, and will not do well below 25 \u00b0C. However, do remember that the warmer the water, the more important it is to ensure a higher level of oxygenation (perhaps letting the return from filters sit above the water line so that filtered water being returned to the tank splashes down onto the water's surface and incorporates more oxygen). Blue Panaques can be quite territorial, so in smaller quarters, it is best to keep just one per tank and not with any similar species. However, if the aquarium is much more specious, several Blue Panaques can be kept together providing that there is an abundance of visual barriers amongst the decor, with more than one cave made available for every fish. Companions should ideally occupy the middle and upper levels, be reasonably peaceful, and be able to thrive in warm, soft water with decent current e.g. some of the smaller characins. Although these fish prefer a diet high in vegetable matter, they will not make any real impact on nuisance algae and must be offered a varied diet (see below). When they are actively grazing, they are actually searching for their natural food source - aufwuchs - which is a type of algae biofilm that contains small invertebrate life. Robust aquarium plants are rarely eaten, but larger fish, in their ongoing search for food items, may possibly uproot newly planted specimens that haven't yet anchored well in to the substrate; a solution to this is to cultivate species on bogwood, such as Java Fern (Microsorum spp.) or Anubias spp. Ensure that regular partial water changes are carried out as these catfish produce a fair amount of waste and will not tolerate an elevated nitrate level. Although the common name of these fish would suggest that they are a type of Panaque, this is slightly misleading as they have been tentatively placed in the Baryancistrus genus. The Blue Panaque name was commonly used by exporters for a number of years prior to the formal description of these fish, and seems to have stuck. To this effect, these fish may also be seen on sale as L239 Blue Finned Panaque, despite them not being true Panaques. Recommended for mature aquaria and experienced aquarists only.",

Nitrate should be kept below 10ppm at all times. There are reports of the fish being triggered into spawning with a combination of increased water flow (i.e. turning on an extra powerhead) and frequent partial water changes with water that is a few degrees cooler. Once spawning has ceased, the male fish will eject the female from the cave, taking on brood care himself.",

The aquarium should be at least 4ft long, as this is an active species that needs swimming space. As with many other Rainbowfish species, the juveniles can look comparatively drab to the absolutely stunning adult fish, and so are all too often overlooked in the shops. However, once settled into the security of the planted aquarium, these young specimens will soon begin to colour up, revealing their true adult beauty. Blue Rainbowfish will not bother smaller tankmates, as their mouth/throat is too narrow to be able to swallow them. Sadly, this species is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN redlist, due to man's activities on the lake that this species is endemic to. Most, if not all of the specimens offered for sale in the trade these days are captive-bred. May also be seen on sale as the Lake Kutubu Rainbowfish.",

A small air-driven sponge filter (with a mature sponge) should be added to give gentle circulation and filtration. The temperature should be set at 25 \u00b0C. A conditioned pair should then be acclimatised across to the breeding aquarium, which should be furnished with plenty of fine-leaved plants/Java moss clumps. After a time, the male will swim in front of the female, displaying the mating stripe on his forehead. He will then begin to drive the female over the plants, utilising the whole length of the tank. The eggs will be scattered over the plants a few at a time. These fish are known as 'continual spawners' which means that the spawning activity takes place over several days/weeks, even months in some cases. This can present problems to the aquarist in that some adult fish may begin to consume the eggs as they are scattered. Many fishkeepers have found the eggs to be remarkably tough and have had great success in siphoning them out into another aquarium (containing matching water from the spawning tank) or else using spawning mops, which, when having caught a number of the eggs, can be moved to a separate tank (again with matching water) and replaced with a new mop, as and when each series of eggs are deposited. The eggs will usually hatch in 5-9 days (dependent on temperature) and once free-swimming, the tiny fry can be offered infusoria, moving onto larger foodstuffs as they develop.",

Good filtration and a frequent partial water change regime are important as these fish (like all species from fast flowing freshwaters) will not tolerate an elevated nitrate level. Powerheads can be used to further create areas of decent current, and the output should be angled in such a way that it causes rippling at the surface of the water in order to keep dissolved oxygen levels high. Driftwood and cobbles can be used to decorate the aquarium but do leave an open swimming space along the front of the tank. This is a gregarious species which should always be maintained in groups of 6 or more. Problems with aggression from the dominant fish may arise if they are kept in too low numbers. Tankmates must be fairly robust and enjoy the same cool, fast-flowing conditions; many of the medium sized barbs, danios, Rhinogobius spp. gobies, Garras, and loaches make excellent companions. Avoid keeping with any shy species, especially those which would be easily outcompeted at feeding times by these boisterous fish.

Their parentage may include species such as A. resticulosa, caetei and/or borelli. Whatever they are, they are one of the most adaptable and hardy of their kind.\nIn the wild, Apistos tend to inhabit slow-moving shallow bodies of water with a substrate is composed mainly of leaf litter, providing a matrix of hiding places. Their aquarium should reflect this and though they thrive in a tank furnished with catappa leaves, they'll be equally at home in shelters made from bogwood or ceramics. Dense planting helps to break up the sight lines and ease territorial conflict, these are cichlids after all and just as aggressive as their larger relatives, albeit on a much smaller scale. They may be dwarves but it's unwise to attempt to keep more than one male in all but the largest of set ups. Females are equally territorial but control much smaller territories and multiple females are usually found within the male's defended area. In small aquaria these fishes can be kept in pairs but if housing more than one female then allow around 30-50cm of tank length for each one and expect all other bottom-dwelling species to be expelled from these areas. \nAlthough requiring consideration for their aggression when breeding, apistos are clever little fishes and associate the absence of other fish as a warning of potential danger. In order to feel secure, they require dither fish in the form of shoaling tetras etc which would quickly dart to safety at the approach of a predator, thus providing an early warning system. If these other species prefer swimming in the higher levels of the water column then they will usually thrive, quickly learning to avoid parental fish as long as space allows. As members of the Eartheater family, Apistos don't generally eat their tankmates and enjoy sifting through a sandy substrate for fine particles of food. Soft water is preferred, although this is less important for day to day care, with low nitrate levels being far more important to health. \nAlthough they don't look much alike, exporters often send this fish as Apistogramma agassizi and you may see them labelled as such. Variations of their common name such as Steel Blue, Blue Face and Blue Head may also be seen.",

Despite their suspected hybrid origins, Blue steel are capable of producing fry and seem to function like many haremic apistos.\nWhen correctly maintained, spawning should happen on a regular basis but is more successful in soft, acidic water. Maternal fish, which advertise their intentions by displaying a bold black and yellow pattern, will select or construct a spawning cave and this may be too small for the male to enter. The male's larger size enables him to cope with the heightened aggression of his mate and he may be excluded from parental duties completely. His role is to guard the territory while the female carries out the brood care. The eggs should hatch after 3 or 4 days, depending on water temperature. The female continues guarding the wrigglers, and after a further 4 or 5 days, will lead the fry out of the cave. She will be very pugnacious at this point, fending off any would-be predators and communicating with the fry using movements of her pelvic fins. The fry will require frequent small feeds with appropriately sized foodstuffs at this point, such as baby brineshrimp and microworm. With full bellies and plenty of partial water changes, the young fish will grow rapidly and should be removed for growing on when the female loses interest in them. Once independent they are driven from the territory and their mother will often spawn again.",

P. aberrans is peaceful by nature and prefers company of its own kind; it is therefore best maintained in groups of 6 or more. Try to obtain a mixture of males and females as the males will exhibit more intense colouration in the presence of females. Unfortunately this species does tend to continually command quite a high price in the shops, so be prepared to budget for a good sized group. The aquarium should be furnished with dark substrate and background, with plenty of shady hiding places amongst driftwood and robust planting (the African Anubias species are ideal). Lighting can be quite bright to showcase the iridescent colours of these fish. Good filtration is, of course, a must, as is a regular maintenance regime - these fish are not tolerant of a build up of nitrogenous wastes. Additional flow should be provided with a powerhead in order to simulate the current and highly oxygenated waters of their natural habitat. P. aberrans is best maintained in a species-only tank, but it can be kept as part of a community of fish of similar size and temperament. Ensure that the tank has tight fitting coverslides as these fish can jump.",

Some will simply allow nature to take its course in the main aquarium (which can be successful if there are plenty of intricate hiding places for tiny eggs and fry) and others choose to move conditioned fish to a separate spawning aquarium. In the breeding tank, there will be spawning material such as mops and filter foam with holes of around 1mm. The eggs will be laid and fertilised within these tiny crevices in the surface of the foam. The eggs take approximately 14-20 days to hatch, this being temperature dependent \"\u201c the warmer the water, the quicker the eggs tend to hatch. Once free-swimming, the fry can be fed with infusoria, moving on to baby brineshrimp and finely powdered foods as they grow. As water quality is so very important, some breeders like to maintain snails such as Ramshorns in the breeding tank to \"mop up\" any leftover food. The snails may take some eggs, but if the right sized filter foams are utilised, the snails will not be able to get the eggs out of the little crevices. Many consider that their benefit far outweighs the loss of a few eggs.",

If a female is receptive, she will accompany him to the pre-dug pit, and they will circle each other. As the female deposits eggs, she immediately takes them into her mouth and then nudges the vent of the male fish with her mouth, signalling to him to release his milt, fertilising the eggs. Males can be quite hard on mouthbrooding females, so it is best to move the female to another aquarium at this point. She will mouthbrood the eggs for 9-11 days, at which point the free-swimming fry are released. The young will start foraging for food straight away and can be offered baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii), microworms, or crushed flake as soon as they are released.

Here, the coastal waters are shallow and highly oxygenated, with strong currents and pummelling wave action. These fascinating bottom-dwelling cichlids are mostly solitary and spend much of their time hopping around amongst pebbles, feeding on algae and the microscopic organisms living within it. Blue-spotted Goby Cichlids have specialised dentition to assist them with scraping the algae from rocks, and a much reduced swimbladder that helps them negate buoyancy and keep their position on the substrate. The aquarium that houses these fish should be biologically mature, with a soft sand substrate and plenty of smooth pebbles and cobbles. Filtration should be efficient with areas of brisk water movement along with some quieter resting spots out of the current. There should be a decent level of oxygenation, and small frequent partial water changes will help keep nitrate to a minimum. Lighting can be fairly bright to encourage algae growth over the stones. Blue-spotted Goby Cichlids are territorial towards conspecifics, but should not be kept alongside aggressive species. Ideally, tankmates will be of similar size and occupy different areas of the aquarium to the goby cichlids, such as Cyprichromis or Paracyprichromis spp which tend to stay higher up in the water column. It is best to keep Blue-spotted Goby Cichlids singly or as a compatible pair, and it should be noted that once a pair forms, the bond is lifelong. The aquarium must be very spacious if more than one pair are to be kept together, with plenty of visual barriers amongst the decor. Not to be kept alongside other goby cichlids from the Eretmodus and Tanganicodus genera.",

Ensure bright lighting is used to encourage natural algal growth. NEVER feed with protein-rich mosquito larvae, beef heart, Tubifex etc as this will lead to bloat, which can be fatal.",
        "breeding": "Bi-parental mouthbrooder. This species has been bred in the home aquarium, but it is not a frequent occurrence. It would make a great breeding project for the serious hobbyist. When ready to spawn, the female selects a suitable flat rock as a spawning site and cleans it thoroughly. The pair will then display to one another whilst circling the spawning site. The female subsequently deposits one or two relatively large eggs, and then immediately turns to take them up into her mouth as the male simultaneously fertilises them. This is repeated until the female is spent of eggs, which may number 10-30 depending on her size/maturity. The eggs are carried in the mouth of the female for around 14 days, during which time she will not feed, and will be easily recognisable by her distended mouth. Once the eggs hatch, the female then transfers the fry to the mouth of the male one or two at a time. He will then continue incubating the fry for a further 7-14 days until they have absorbed their yolk sacs, before releasing them (usually at night) a few at a time and ensuring they each find hiding places. There is no need to immediately remove the parent fish or fry if they are in a species-only aquarium, as the parents will tolerate the fry for a reasonable period of time. In Tanganyikan community aquaria, however, it would be best to move the mouthbrooding male to a tank with no predators, before he is due to release the fry. Once they have been released, he may then be acclimatised back to the main aquarium. The free-swimming fry can be offered crushed Spirulina flake and baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii). The fry are slow-growing and will typically reach 2.5cm (1\") in length after around 4 months.",

Named in honour of Brazillian aquarist Luiz Wada, these fishes have been popular in their homeland for a number of years and breed readily in captivity, with tank bred specimens becoming the norm in the trade.\n\nAway from the hobby, their native habitat is described as clearwater streams of moderate to rapid current that flow over a sandy substrate. As any fish in the trade will be only a generation or two away from their wild ancestors, it's wise to provide them with the soft, acidic conditions they've evolved to thrive in. Their sociable nature makes them a good choice as dither fish for shy catfish or dwarf cichlids and they'll feel at home in a planted aquarium which provides open areas in which the males can try to intimidate one another whilst trying to impress the females, as they develop colours which are only hinted at in the conditions of a shop system.\nAs they're relative newcomers, no aquarium forms have been developed and captive fish look exactly like their wild counterparts. Until albino forms or long-finned mutations appear the only possible naming confusion comes from one or two other tetras that share the common name occasionally, or use of the German name Blackberry tetra.

Vegetation usually consists of Lagarosiphon, Nymphaea, Ottelia, and Utricularia spp. as well as various marginal grasses, and the water depth decreases as the dry season progresses. Occasionally such pools are used by the local inhabitants to cultivate rice. This beautiful species is an annual killifish, which means it only lives up to a year at most - so the need to reproduce is of high importance. As such, the young fishes develop very quickly in order to fulfil this need (sexual maturity is reached in a matter of weeks), and the resultant eggs are able to survive periods of drought in the substrate, hatching when the rainy season returns and thus providing a new generation to continue the cycle.\nThis fish will bring activity and colour to the aquarium, but is best maintained in a species-only breeding tank, with 2 or more females to every male. If keeping more than one male in the same aquarium, do ensure that the tank is spacious and heavily decorated in order for rival males to retreat to safety if necessary. If tankmates are desired, these killifish can be kept alongside other species such as pencilfish, Kuhli loaches, Corydoras catfish, Sparkling/Croaking Gouramis etc., which all enjoy the same softwater conditions. They are, however, not suitable for the general community. When kept in a specialised community, the aquarium should be heavily planted (include floating species) with the incorporation of plenty of bogwood. Adding botanicals such as Catappa leaves is suggested to help keep the water soft, acidic and tannin stained, all of which will help to show the fish in their best colours. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement gentle. Small partial water changes should be carried out on a regular and frequent basis. Tight fitting coverslides are a must as these fish are expert jumpers.",
        "feeding": "Dried foods should be offered as a staple but are not always eagerly taken. Small live and frozen foods such as mosquito larvae, daphnia, cyclops, baby brineshrimp, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp etc. can be used to provide a varied diet. Females have a large calorific requirement, as they'll often be producing eggs on a daily basis!",
        "breeding": "In the wild, the natural habitat becomes completely desiccated during the dry season, and the adult fish die, leaving fertilised eggs within the substrate. The eggs can withstand the harsh, dry conditions and remain in situ until the rainy season starts a few months later. Once wet, the eggs hatch and the resultant fry grow and reach sexual maturity very quickly. If you wish to breed this species, it is best to add a plastic container to the aquarium that is lined with coir or fibrous peat (to about 2cm thickness) and a couple of stones to weigh it down, which will provide a suitable spawning medium. This allows for much easier removal of the eggs from the water. After a few days of spawning, lift the container from the aquarium, slowly pouring out as much water as possible. The substrate should then be gently squeezed to drain as much water out as you can. The eggs are quite robust, but do proceed carefully. Place the spawning medium onto a paper towel to air dry for a few hours, then seal in a plastic bag. The eggs and moss should then be left in the bag at a steady room temperature for around 2-3 months: this replicates the dry season. Keep checking the eggs. When they are ready to hatch, the eyes of the fry will be visible through the eggs. Eggs that have not yet developed will be clear. Once the eyes are visible, you can be certain that the eggs are ready for the start of the simulated rainy season. Undo the bag and gently place the peat moss in a container, ensuring that the moss is spread out evenly. Add some mature aquarium water to a depth of 5cm with a small amount of aquarium salt added - this will help to prevent Velvet disease. Hatching will occur quickly, with the fry emerging in a matter of hours. Once free-swimming, they can be offered infusoria followed by newly hatched brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii).",

The eggs will be scattered over the plants a few at a time. These fish are known as 'continual spawners' which means that the spawning activity takes place over several days/weeks, even months in some cases. This can present problems to the aquarist in that some adult fish may begin to consume the eggs as they are scattered. Many fishkeepers have found the eggs to be remarkably tough and have had great success in siphoning them out into another aquarium (containing matching water from the spawning tank) or else using spawning mops, which, when having caught a number of the eggs, can be moved to a separate tank (again with matching water) and replaced with a new mop, as and when each series of eggs are deposited. The eggs will usually hatch in 6-8 days (dependent on temperature) and once free-swimming, the tiny fry can be offered infusoria, moving onto larger foodstuffs as they develop.",

The aquarium should be at least 30\" long for a pair, larger if housing a group, which will become a little territorial towards one another but this approach has the advantage of producing much more compatible pairs. The tank itself should have a sandy substrate, with shady hiding areas amongst bogwood and dense areas of planting. Bolivian Rams can be kept alongside other small peaceable fish and as with many other dwarf cichlids species, they will only tend to show any real aggression when breeding. Despite sharing a genus with the more familiar Ram (M. ramirezi) these beautiful fish seem to have more in common with the Cupid cichlids in the genus Biotodoma and like them, are often dismissed as rather drab when seen in stock tanks as juveniles. Sometimes labelled as Clown Ruby Cichlids by Asian breeders.\n  Fishes from the Rio Guapore in Brazil have now been described as M. maculicauda, having been known in the hobby as M. sp. 'zweifleck'.

The water should be soft and acidic-neutral. When ready to spawn, the fish will begin to clean a spawning site, which is usually a flat piece of rock. Up to 200 eggs will be deposited on the flat stone, and after fertilisation, the female will care for the eggs and can be observed fanning them with her fins. The male will guard the perimeter from predators. Once the fry become free-swimming, they are carried into depressions in the substrate and defended by both parents.",

The tank should be sited in a quiet area and have as large a surface area as possible due to the fact this species can be rather skittish; indeed, it is very important that it is given adequate space so as not to damage the long, delicate mouth parts on the aquarium glass if it suddenly swims at speed. Tall tangles of driftwood and dense planting, including plenty of surface cover from floating species will help to feel these fish feel more secure. Filtration should be efficient but water movement gentle, and we'd suggest the use of aquarium peat as a filter medium to help emulate the natural water conditions. The addition of leaf litter would further help in this respect - dried Indian Almond leaves (Terminalia catappa) are ideal and are readily available. Much attention must be paid to water quality since H. tengah will not tolerate elevated nitrates or swings in water chemistry; small partial water changes should be carried out on a frequent basis.

A courting pair will hover under the water's surface, more or less parallel to each other, before the male swims jerkily alongside her, then swims backwards and around, so he is alongside her other flank. He will repeat this several times, moving around her in a loose rectangle. When ready to mate, the male stops alongside the female and tilts his body upwards and towards her. The pair bring their genital regions together and mate, before the male changes side again.

The tank itself does not have to be particularly large for a pair, but it must have a soft sand substrate with a choice of empty snail shells on offer (escargot shells are usually quickly approved of). These fish should never be kept without snail shells (or substitutes such as small PVC elbow tubes). Clean water is essential, so be sure to carry out plenty of regular partial water changes. These fish can be sensitive to changes in conditions, so it is best to ensure that the new (dechlorinated) water is of the same temperature as the tank water, and should be added slowly. In larger aquaria, with open sandy areas around their home shell, these fish may be kept with other small and relatively peaceful Tanganyikan cichlids, but the fry survival rate will obviously not be quite so high. Do not use shells with tight narrow spirals, as they may become trapped. Numerous different geographic variants are available, including 'Chaitika', 'Chimba', 'Ikola Sunspot', 'Karilani', 'Katabe', 'Kigoma', 'Kitumba', 'Ruziba', 'Zaire', and 'Zambia'.

At this time, the male usually defends the perimeter of the shell pit/crater against any possible predators (whether they are present in the tank or not).

As hybridisation may occur, it's best to keep Tropheus in groups of their own kind and these should be large in number to spread the aggression. Housing 15 or more of these feisty fishes requires a large aquarium and this should be 1.5m or more in length to allow individuals to avoid one another. Smaller groups inevitably dwindle as harassment and bullying proves too much for the females and weaker males. It is important that the entire group is added at the same time to avoid the aggression which would otherwise be directed towards any newcomers. When adding large numbers of fish in this manner, it's important that the filtration is cycled and capable of handling the waste load. Given the investment involved, the use of a matured filter and bacterial inoculation with products such as Microbe Lift are strongly advised. As always, water quality should be very carefully monitored over the first few weeks. Excellent water quality must be maintained at all times, with partial water changes carried out at least once or twice a week and this may require the addition of buffers to ensure the high pH and carbonate hardness levels required. Strong water movement will ensure high oxygen levels and helps to keep the fish fit and active.\nAlthough Tropheus can be kept in fairly bare aquaria, several separate piles of rocks should be created (instead of a continuous rocky reef) so that individuals can more easily evade one another thanks to broken sight lines. Lighting should be bright to encourage the growth of algae over the decor, which these herbivores will enjoy browsing upon. Sharp rocks (such as lava rock) should not be used as they can cause damage to the mouths of these fishes as they graze.\nAside from a tendency to kill one another best controlled by keeping them in big groups, diet is the other major factor in successful care. These fishes are very prone to bloating caused by excessive quantities of rich food and this should be considered when mixing them with other species. Prospective tank mates should be able to thrive on the same diet and this may limit selection.\nSeveral different regional colour variations are known, including Canary Cheek, Kipili, Ulwile and Nyanza; these should not be mixed together in the same aquarium.",
        "feeding": "A staple diet based on algae such as spirulina is recommended, together with occasional feeds of high-fibre frozen foods such as Daphnia, Mysis and Cyclops. Avoid feeding these fishes too generously. Fine sand substrates may be useful in aiding gut health by providing beneficial indigestible matter.",
        "breeding": "Males should be outnumbered with females because of their constant desire to spawn, and this harassment (which can be quite intense) will then be spread, so that no one fish bears the brunt of the males' continual amorous attention. The trickiest part of conditioning females is ensuring they have sufficient opportunity to avoid being pestered by males. Properly kept, breeding occurs naturally and females mouth brood a small clutch (<20) of very large eggs for three weeks or more. Maternal care continues a little longer and fry are capable of feeding inside their mother's mouth. Young fish are preferentially released in shallow water with rich algal growth and fewer predators - having rockwork reaching the surface or piles of small stones will provide suitable areas.",

Ancistrus sp. are great algae eaters, and growing to a maximum 12cm in length, offer a welcome alternative to the common Pleco which attains a monstrous size and is unsuitable for all but the largest of aquariums. Bristlenose catfish prefer a strong water current with plenty of oxygenation. Numerous hiding places should be provided, and should include a good amount of bogwood in order for the fish to graze and extract lignin from it \" an essential part of their diet. Plants may be safely kept with Bristlenose Catfish, and most small-medium community type fish kept harmoniously alongside them. If keeping more than one specimen (or if keeping with other Loricarids), the occasional minor scuffle for territory may occur, but no serious damage will arise if the fish are given enough space. Bristlenose Catfish must only be added to mature aquariums. Albino, mottled, orange, snow white and long-finned varieties are available. Some of these blue/dark-eyed pale forms are sometimes referred to as L144 but it seems that the few fishes identified under that code have now been extensively crossed into the domestic lines of Ancistrus cf. cirrhosus.",

Algae wafers and tablets are ideal, with the occasional addition of some vegetable matter such as cucumber, lettuce, or peeled steamed peas. Other, meatier sinking and frozen foods will be taken, but it is important to ensure that these fish receive a diet that is mainly vegetable based. As mentioned above, do make certain to include some bogwood in the aquarium.",

In order to ensure a good surviving brood size, set up a separate softwater spawning aquarium for your breeding pair of Bristlenoses, and furnish will some small cave-like structures (bogwood, rock and slate piles, clean new flowerpots etc). Lighting should not be too bright, and filter intakes protected with sponges in order to safeguard the fry. Bristlenose are secretive cave spawners and up to 120 amber coloured eggs will be laid/fertilised in one of the small caves or crevices provided. The male tirelessly guards the eggs and keeps a good amount of oxygen flowing over them by continually fanning with his pectoral fins. After approximately 5 days, the eggs will hatch into wrigglers and they will attach themselves to the decor and tank walls. The yolk sacs are absorbed over a 10-14 day period, after which time they will become free-swimming. Given the right conditions, it is not unknown for compatible pairs to spawn every 6 weeks.",

The tank should be furnished with plenty of driftwood to create lots of shady areas, and the tannins that are gradually released from the wood should help to acidify the water whilst giving it a natural, clear tea-colour. Peat filtration can also help in this respect. Although little detailed information is available regarding the natural habitat of this species, it is unlikely that aquatic plants are found in any great abundance. However, in the home aquarium, these fish seem very at home in tanks with areas of dense, robust planting and a moderate water flow. Lighting should not be too bright (tannins and floating plants can help to diffuse brighter lighting), and darker substrate and background choices will help to show off their exquisite colouration. Broken-Line Tetras should always be maintained in good sized groups, 6 would be the minimum recommended, 10+ would be better. Not only will the fish feel more secure, but this will result in a far more effective, natural-looking shoal. Ideally, tankmates will also be small and peaceful, and could include Corydoras catfish, small dwarf cichlids such as Apistogramma or Mikrogeophagus, some of the smaller Loricariidae (suckermouth catfish), and many of the more peaceable Botiid loaches. Broken-Line Tetras are highly sought after, although unfortunately rarely imported. You may also see this fish labelled up as Ulrey's Tetra, or, erroneously as Astyanax sp. Lago Tefe.",

However if you wish to raise a good number of fry, a separate, softwater breeding aquarium should be set up for the purpose. It is thought that well-conditioned specimens can be coaxed into breeding by \"overwintering\" at a slightly cooler temperature, then gradually and carefully increasing the temperature and frequency of partial water changes. Clumps of Java moss or a few bunches of fine-leaved plants should be added to the breeding tank to give the fish somewhere to scatter their eggs, and very gentle filtration should be provided via an air-driven sponge filter (a small bag of peat can be incorporated here). No dedicated lighting should be used, as eggs and fry are rather light sensitive. The parents should be removed immediately after spawning ceases as they will predate on the eggs. Some aquarists like to use a fine mesh in the tank so that the scattered eggs can fall to safety, away from the attention of the adult fish. Ideally try and keep the tank in darkness once eggs have been scattered, to protect them and the resultant sensitive young fry from being damaged by bright light. The eggs should hatch within 24-36 hours (temperature dependent) and the young will initially feed from their yolk sacs. Once free-swimming (usually after 3-4 days), microscopic foodstuffs such as infusoria/Paramecium should then be offered, followed by baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and microworm as they grow.",

Unfortunately, this means that they cannot be kept safely alongside other fish in the confines of the home aquarium, as tankmates will be systematically stripped of their scales and will likely perish in a short time. However, Bucktoothed Characins can be kept successfully in the aquarium if they are maintained in a sizeable shoal of their own kind, in spacious quarters and with no other fish present; indeed, this is not only the best way to maintain them but it also makes for a very eye-catching display. Ideally, the aquarium will house at least 12 specimens (and more if room allows), all of similar size, introduced simultaneously. Smaller groups than 12 are unlikely to work as the stronger fish will relentlessly bully the smaller specimens to death. A larger shoal means that no single fish should bear the constant brunt of the squabbling - instead, any antagonistic behaviour will be spread more evenly throughout the group. The aquarium should be at least 5ft long, with a sandy substrate, tangles of driftwood, some smooth rocks, and areas of dense planting. Thick vegetation will also help to create plenty of visual barriers, breaking up lines-of-sight, which in turn helps with reducing aggression. Filtration needs to be efficient to cope with a heavy stocking level of moderately sized, energetic fish with voracious appetites, although water movement need not be too vigorous. Frequent partial water changes are recommended for keeping nitrate to a minimum as this species will not tolerate deteriorating water conditions.

The holes should be large enough for eggs to fall through, yet small enough to stop the predatory adult fish from being able to reach them. A pair of well-conditioned fish should then be carefully acclimatised across and observed carefully. Always have a tank divider on hand should one fish become overly aggressive towards the other, or be prepared to abandon the attempt and move the fish back to the main aquarium and try another pair.

        "care": "The Bumblebee Cichlid is endemic to Lake Malawi where it occurs in the deepwater rocky habitat at Chinyankwazi Island, Chisumulu Island, Chiyamwezi Island, Eccles Reef, Likoma Island, Maleri Island, Mbenji Island, Nkata Bay, and West Reef. Here these Mbuna live in sizeable caves together with the large bagrid catfish, the Kampango (Bagrus meridionalis). For the majority of the time, the cichlids exhibit the typical yellow and brown barred 'bumblebee' colouration, and whilst in this dress, the catfish perceives them as no threat and allows them to clean external parasites from its skin. The catfish are cave spawners which produce thousands of eggs, and the cichlids are able to steal these eggs by quickly assuming a dark brown/black colour and sneaking into the catfish nest. As soon as they have eaten their fill of catfish eggs, the cichlids revert to the 'safe' bumblebee pattern and the catfish is none the wiser. The aquarium should be at least 4ft long and aquascaped to emulate a rocky reef effect with plenty of caves and a sandy substrate. Decor such as ocean rock can be used to build sturdy structures which stretch from the base of the tank to near the surface of the water. These structures should be built with the purpose of creating many crevices for the fish to explore but constructed in such a way so as to keep the rocks stable if the fish start to dig around and underneath them. Although a substrate of coral sand or Aragonite is often recommended to help to keep the water hard and alkaline, Mbuna feel safer and show better colours over a darker substrate. The Aragonite or coral sand can always be placed into a mesh bag and kept inside the external filter for buffering purposes. Most rock-dwelling species are extremely aggressive and need to be kept under conditions of 'controlled-overcrowding' to prevent territorial disputes ending fatally - additional filtration may also be required to cope with a heavy bioload. The Bumblebee Cichlid is a particularly belligerent species, and it is best to keep one male in a harem situation with several females (keeping just one female with a male will result in continual harassment and possibly death). This species can be kept successfully alongside other outgoing Mbuna, although it is best to avoid fish with a similar colour pattern.",
        "feeding": "As this fish feeds on parasites and insect larvae in the wild, it is likely that it would benefit from a more protein rich diet compared to most other Mbuna. Offer a good quality flake food, appropriately sized granular foods, and small meaty frozen foods such as Mysis shrimp, vitamin/Spirulina-enriched brineshrimp, mosquito larvae etc along with some vegetable matter such as cucumber, blanched spinach and romaine lettuce.",
        "breeding": "When ready to spawn, the colouration of the male will intensify and his aggression level will heighten. He will choose and clean a spawning site, then display to the female fish until one accepts him. They will circle each other in a head to tail manner a number of times, until the female deposits her eggs. These are deposited just one or two at a time and after doing so, she immediately turns around and picks them up. At the same time, the male will rotate so that he is almost on his side, at the same time shaking and extending his anal fin, releasing his milt. The female sees the egg spots on the male's anal fin and attempts to pick up those \"eggs\" whilst she is picking up the real ones that she deposited, and at the same time taking in milt. This is the method of fertilisation, and this ritual may go on for some hours. The eggs may be incubated for up to 25 days until they hatch and the resultant fry held for a further few days afterwards. Typical brood size for a good sized female would number around 25.",

        "care": "The diminutive Bumblebee Goby is known from a variety of different lowland coastal habitats - both freshwater and brackish - including estuaries, mangrove swamps, streams, and tidal creeks. Here, the substrate consists of mud, silt, or sand, and is strewn with scattered pieces of driftwood, mangrove roots, shells, water worn rocks, and decaying plant matter. The aquarium should be mature and furnished with a soft sand substrate, ideally fine coral sand which will help to keep the water hard and alkaline. Create plenty of hiding places using smooth rocks/cobbles, large shells, tangles of driftwood, and dense clumps of hardy vegetation. Species such as Anubias and Vallisneria will cope well with harder water. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement fairly gentle. Small, frequent water changes will help keep nitrate to a minimum, particularly important as this species is especially sensitive to deteriorating water conditions. Bumblebee Gobies can be rather quarrelsome with one another, so it is always best to keep a large sized group (8 or more) so that any territorial behaviour is spread evenly throughout the group, with no single fish bearing the continual brunt of it. Smaller groups do not often fare as well. Ensure there are plenty of caves and crevices (visual barriers) in order for these fish to form their territories. If there aren\"\u2122t enough territories per fish, the males in particular will become rather aggressive with one another; as a guide, at least two or three hiding places per fish should be provided. Bumblebee Gobies are best maintained in a species-only set-up, but in more voluminous aquaria, they have been successfully kept alongside species such as Glassfish and various livebearers that are large enough not to be considered food, and which tend to occupy the upper levels of the water column. If maintaining these fish under brackish conditions, be sure to use a quality marine salt for water changes, and monitor salinity carefully with a hydrometer.",

The eggs should hatch within 4-7 days (temperature dependent), and once free-swimming, the fry will require baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii).

        "care": "The Bumblebee Horn Snail is a small member of the Nerite algae-eating group of snails, and has an attractive black and yellow pattern with random protruding \"horns\" over the shell. These snails are great for planted community aquaria, where no predatory fish are present (i.e. loaches, pufferfish etc). Despite their diminutive size, these little gastropods are amazingly efficient algae grazers and so are a real benefit to the aquarist. Your prized plants, such as slow growing Anubias species, will benefit from the snails gentle grazing habits as they will help to prevent the build up of otherwise difficult-to-remove algae from their leaves. Only dead or decaying plant matter will be eaten. The water should be moderately hard and alkaline to allow for healthy shell development. In softer water, where the calcium concentration will be lower, the snails will be very prone deterioration of the shell. It is best to maintain a water line slightly lower than is usual (about the same gap as the height of the largest snail will be sufficient) to allow them to move in and out of the water if they choose. However, do ensure that the coverslides are kept tightly shut and any small gaps plugged, as these snails are excellent escape artists. Ensure that the tank is well filtered and that regular partial water changes are carried out, at the same time vacuuming the substrate to ensure that the mulm that can accumulate from the snails waste products is removed. In the wild, Bumblebee Horn Snails inhabit waters with a moderate flow, so do ensure that there are areas of good water movement within their aquarium. Be very careful when handling these snails as the spiky \"horns\" can pierce the skin. Never use treatments containing copper when snails are present.",
        "feeding": "These snails feed primarily on algae and biofilm. In the absence of such foodstuffs, the snails will usually feed on algae wafers, sinking pellets and slices of vegetables. Some aquarists like to culture algae on rocks and cobbles in a separate aquarium (often on a windowsill) so that they can switch these rocks on a rotational basis with rocks from the tank that has been cleaned of algae by the snails. This provides an ongoing source of natural greenfoods, should the snails not take to the provision of prepared foods.",
        "breeding": "Breeding these beautiful snails is sadly next to impossible as the eggs will not hatch in freshwater (although some aquarists may see this as a positive as their tanks will not become overrun with these snails!). Trails of white eggs may be laid on any hard surfaces around the aquarium, but they will not be able to hatch into veligers (snail larvae) unless they are in brackish water. The larvae then require an abundance of minute foodstuffs such as phytoplankton and microalgae to survive to snail stage.",

In the wild, H. burgessi is known from pristine blackwater tributaries of the upper Negro River basin, so they will always be at their best in soft, acidic water long-term. Unfortunately, this species can be a little prone to barbel infections/erosion, so it is of paramount importance that they are kept on a soft sand substrate (rather than gravel where waste can build up unseen) in order to protect these delicate sensory organs. Regular maintenance, including frequent partial water changes, should be carried out in order to keep these fish in good condition. Provide plenty of shady areas amongst driftwood, rocks, and areas of dense planting. Other peaceful species such as some of the smaller pencilfish, tetra, and rasboras make ideal tankmates, and their presence as dither fish in midwater will encourage the Corydoras out into view more often. Corydoras have the ability to breathe air intestinally, so a small gap should be left between the surface of the water and the cover slides in order for the fish to come up to the surface and take air in. It may do this numerous times per day.\nThis species is similar to several Corys with orange head blotches; however, this area tends to be more gold/peach coloured in H. burgessi.\nHoplisoma was recently split from Corydoras and contains many familiar species.",

Unfortunately the eggs of this species are prone to fungus, so some fishkeepers like to add a small amount of methylene blue to the breeding tank.

Providing surface cover in the form of floating plant species will help provide the right conditions for breeding. It is essential that the aquarium has a tight fitting lid as these fishes are expert jumpers, and a small gap must be left between the surface of the water and the coverslides in order for the fish to come up and take in humid air. Using a tall aquarium with a low water level planted in a paludarium style, greatly reduces the likelihood of jumping, as well as providing plenty of surface cover and natural control of dissolved wastes. Snakeheads are obligate air breathers, which means they must have access to atmospheric air or they will drown.\nYoung snakeheads may be kept in groups until two fish pair up but pairs should be monitored for aggression, especially after spawning. These fish are best maintained in a species-only aquarium, if tankmates are desired, they must be able to tolerate the seasonally low winter temperatures required as this species needs a seasonal change in temperature and maintenance to emulate the wet and dry months. During the winter period that coincides with the dry season, the fishes' metabolism will slow down and they will not show much interest in food. The water level can be dropped, the day length should be shortened and the reduction in waste levels means that water changes can be dramatically reduced. These annual rest periods seem to be imperative for long-term health, vitality, and breeding potential.\nThis fish may also be seen as the Ornate snakehead and some regional forms exhibit differences in lip colour, to avoid any accidental hybridisation or compatibility issues, these different forms should not be housed together.

This active species does, however, have something of a reputation for being a little nippy, but there are several ways in which this can be controlled. Firstly, a large sized group of these fish (with 2-3 females to every male) will help them to focus attentions on themselves. A shoal of at least 8-10 fish is preferable in a good sized tank. Secondly, when considering tankmates, choose only other fast-swimming, short-finned fish. Anything that has fancy fins and is of a slow-moving nature will be targeted. Smaller aquaria inevitably force the fish closer together, so if planning on keeping a mixed species tank, ensure ample room; if a larger tank is out of the question, then a species-only tank is the way to go. The provision of plenty of rocks and vegetation will also help to create visual barriers which fish can retreat amongst if they feel threatened. An Alpha male usually arises from the group, and he may be a little quarrelsome with the other males at times, but if the above guidelines are followed, no real harm should ensue. Ameca splendens is well known for its avid algae-eating ability (even eating Cyanobacteria a.k.a. \"blue green algae\"), so inevitably some soft-leaved plants may also be seen as food. Choose robust or fast-growing species to help maintain a well-planted appearance. Strong lighting is not an issue, as algae growth will not become a problem in the aquarium containing a group of Ameca splendens! At all times, the water must be kept clean and with high levels of oxygenation. Partial water changes should be carried out at least once a week. Softwater conditions will not be tolerated.

        "care": "The Butterfly Plec is known from the soft, acidic waters of the Orinoco basin. It is an attractive, streamlined species which makes a good community fish on account of its manageable adult size. Provide a mature aquarium with plenty of shady hiding places amongst tangles of bogwood, rocky caves, and robust planting. Filtration should be efficient with areas of brisk water movement along with several quieter resting areas out of the current. There should be a decent level of oxygenation, and small frequent partial water changes will help keep nitrate to a minimum. The Butterfly Plec is generally peaceful, but it will show some territorial aggression towards its own kind if not given enough space. In most instances though, they can be maintained in small groups and with similar species as long as there is adequate room and enough hiding places to go round. Tankmates could include any small-medium sized peaceful fish that thrive in softwater conditions, such as Corydoras catfish, hatchetfish, and tetras. The common name was coined for the large pectoral and pelvic fins that seem to flutter in the current.",
        "feeding": "Omnivorous. Offer a variety of different foodstuffs containing some vegetable matter. Bloodworm, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, and Mysis shrimp should all be enthusiastically consumed, and these can be supplemented with algae wafers and sinking catfish tablets/pellets along with vegetable matter such as courgette, cucumber, lettuce, squash, spinach etc. It is believed that this species requires bogwood for grazing purposes, so be sure to include this in your set-up.",
        "breeding": "The Butterfly Plec has been bred in the home aquarium. This species is a cave spawner with broods numbering from 50-120 eggs. The male fish guards the eggs, which should hatch in 9-10 days (temperature dependent).",

        "care": "Like all corys, this fish is a small, peaceful, bottom-dwelling catfish that is ideal for mature, softwater community aquaria. Gregarious by nature, corys should be kept in groups of 5 or more; this will not only create a beautiful display, but it will give these sociable, shoaling fish much more confidence to venture out into the open. Like all of its kin, this fish is best kept on a soft sand substrate where it can root around and forage without risk to its barbels which can be damaged by abrasion and bacterial infections from the accumulated waste that often builds up in coarse gravel. Regular maintenance, including frequent partial water changes, should be carried out in order to keep these fish in good condition. Provide some shady retreats amongst bogwood and areas of dense planting, and keep only with small, peaceable tankmates, such as some of the smaller sized characins/cyprinids/anabantoids or dwarf cichlids. Corydoras have the ability to breathe air intestinally, so a small gap should be left between the surface of the water and the cover slides in order for the fish to come up to the surface and take air in. It may do this numerous times per day.\nThis catfish is similar in markings to the Three-lined cory (Hoplisoma trilineatus). However, C102 grows larger and has a longer snout. Confusion with the more finely-spotted Brazilian B. leopardus is far more likely, with differences in pattern and location being the best way to separate young fishes. Like many Peruvian fishes, they are frequently imported via Colombia and are usually offered as Leopard corys. Recent work on the previously enormous genus Corydoras has moved this species into Brochis, reflecting a close kinship despite some differences such as numbers of dorsal fin rays and a lack of senior synonyms used for the other groups/lineages of former Corydoras species. Further studies will probably result in this fish being placed in a new genus.",

        "care": "The Oranda is a selectively bred strain of goldfish. Domesticated goldfish date back to China's Ming dynasty and Fancy goldfish have long been popular aquarium pets, although often as a first venture into keeping an aquarium. This is a mixed blessing, as there are far better choices for small aquaria than these big, messy fishes. Given appropriate housing and care, fancy goldfish can attain a large size and easily live for more than 15-20 years. The aquarium should be spacious and ideally around 1.2 metres long to allow room for 30cm adults to be comfortable. The length and width of the tank are much more important than the height in this respect.\nFancy goldfish grow quickly so it is best to provide them with the largest aquarium that you can from the outset to provide a much safe, stable environment for them. The larger the volume of water, the more stable it will be in terms of water chemistry and temperature. During the warmer months, these fish can be kept outside in raised water features suitably filtered and protected from predators. This can be a great way to provide extra room for your pets and they'll benefit from the semi-natural conditions. Like any goldfish, Orandas will benefit from a seasonal drop in temperature and this can be provided by either moving them indoors in late autumn, or positioning their aquarium in a room that experiences cool room temperatures during the winter. Fancy goldfish are notoriously messy fish; they are voracious eaters and continually stir up the substrate in their ongoing search for food. Such considerable amounts of waste can lead to water quality issues in smaller aquaria if not monitored very closely. Efficient filtration that can handle copius solids is essential, and weekly partial water changes are advised in order to keep nitrate to a minimum. The water should be well-oxygenated (of particular importance during warmer spells of weather) and this is easily achieved by the use of spray-bar returns from filters or the use of an air pumps. Various species of robust plants can be added to the aquarium, but these will likely require periodic replacement due to them being uprooted/eaten - something most goldfish keepers accept and allow their fish to take pleasure in. The substrate can consist of rounded fine gravel or sand, and decor can include smooth rocks and ornaments with no sharp edges. Orandas are sociable creatures and should be kept in groups, either with their own kind or with other varieties of fancy goldfish. It is best, however, to avoid keeping the standard 'single-tailed' common goldfish alongside the fancy varieties as the common goldfish is a faster swimmer and may outcompete the fancies at feeding time. Calico fish have non-metallic scales, making their skin tones visible.",
        "feeding": "Due to their body shape, these fish need a high fibre diet and digestive problems are often the cause of buoyancy issues as transit times are compromised by convoluted digestive tracts. Goldfish also tend to swallow air in their rush to feed which also leads to problems which are best avoided by the use of sinking foods. These can be in the form of pellets, sticks or flake presented beneath the water surface. Frozen foods or live foods such as bloodworm, Mysis, and Daphnia will provide fibre and can be fed extensively to individuals displaying issues that are often categorised as Swim Bladder Disease. The opportunity to browse on aquatic plants will help to ensure gut health.",
        "breeding": "Well-conditioned fancy goldfish will often spawn in the home aquarium. Female fish will be noticeably rounder bellied when full of eggs, and the male fish will develop spawning tubercles (tiny raised bumps) on the gill plates and pectoral fins. A large, slightly cooler water change is often enough to trigger ready pairs into spawning. As the temperature slowly rises back up to its usual level, the male will pursue the female around the aquarium, but generally in a non-aggressive manner. This courtship ritual may last more than a day before spawning commences, and the colours of the fish often intensify at this time. The male fish will nudge the female into the fine-leaved plants (or spawning mops), where she will then scatter eggs which the male simultaneously fertilises. Spawning can last for a number of hours, and several thousand adhesive eggs may be scattered over the plants/spawning mop. The adults will be hungry and will start to devour as many eggs as they can find, so are best moved to another aquarium. The eggs take 4-5 days to hatch, depending on water temperature. Young fancy goldfish are often brown in colour (like their ancestors) and it can take up to a year before full colouration becomes apparent. Fancy goldfish often produce young that differ from their parents - high quality fish that show the best attributes of their breed are normally in the minority, hence the differences in price and quality between fish.",

Here it is found in the intermediate zone, where rocks give way to open sand.\nAs adult males grow too large to fit in the females' shells, they seek shelter in nearby rocks. His territory will include several small empty Neothauma tanganyicense snail shells, in which females take up residence. Unlike the colonial shell dwellers, males defend a patch that includes scattered shells inhabited by females within their own territories. The females will spend much of their time in their individual shell; indeed it is here that each female will rest, retreat to when necessary, spawn and raise her young. The tank itself does not have to be particularly large for a pair but extra females will require their shells to be a significant distance apart. The aquarium must have a soft sand substrate in which the fish will optimally position their homes. Offer a selection of widely-spaced empty snail shells (escargot shells are usually quickly approved of). Clean water is essential, so be sure to carry out plenty of regular partial water changes. These fish can be sensitive to changes in conditions, so it is best to ensure that the new water is of the same temperature as the tank, and should be added slowly. In larger aquaria, these fish may be kept with other small and relatively peaceful Tanganyikan cichlids, especially if adjacent habitats such as rockpiles are thoughtfully positioned, as these are mostly fish of open sand habitat. Do not use shells with tight narrow spirals, as the females may become trapped.\nN. calliurus is very frequently misidentified as N. brevis. However, there are some distinctive differences - calliurus attains a much larger adult size, 11cm compared to the 5.5cm of brevis and also displays a yellow spot above the gill cover. Tail shape is also different, with the rounded tail of brevis being absent in this species. Instead females and young males display a cornered truncate caudal fin without strong markings.",

At this time, the male usually defends the perimeter of the shell pit/crater against any possible predators (whether they are present in the tank or not).

Here, these laterally compressed fish glide effortlessly between cracks and crevices in their ongoing search for shrimps, other small crustaceans, and fish fry. The aquarium that houses this species should be at least 5ft long, with a good amount of filtration, water movement and oxygenation. The best choice of substrate would be coral sand or aragonite, which will help to keep the water hard and alkaline. Rocks should be used to create small outcrops and plenty of caves, ensuring that there are ample visual barriers. Despite their slightly menacing appearance, Calvus Cichlids are usually only mildly aggressive towards one another in the confines of the home aquarium, and broken lines of sight amongst the decor will help if any problems do arise. These cichlids can be maintained in a species-only aquarium or as part of a Tanganyikan community with fish of similar size and temperament. Due to the capacious mouth and predatory nature, they are not to be housed with small fish, such as shelldwellers. If a breeding pair forms within the group, they can become much more territorially aggressive than usual, and it is often best to move them to a tank of their own at this stage. Calvus Cichlids are intolerant of poor water conditions, so ensure small partial water changes are carried out on a frequent basis.

She will then deposit eggs onto the substrate inside the cave, whilst the male releases his milt at the entrance. Both fish will then fan the water with their pectoral fins, in order to direct the milt over the eggs, which may number as many as 200. The female fish guards the eggs inside the cave, whilst the male guards the general perimeter around it. The eggs should hatch within 48 hours (temperature dependent) and will become free-swimming some 7-10 days later. At this point, the young can be offered baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii). It may be prudent to move the male to other quarters before the fry become free-swimming, as he may predate on them.

        "care": "The real Pelvicachromis kribensis is a beautiful West African dwarf cichlid which most of us will be more familiar with as P. taeniatus. Due to confusion over common names, it can be a challenging fish to research, as inevitably the confusion with the ubiquitous P. pulcher complicates things enormously.\nA pair of these exquisite little cichlids are suitable for community aquariums measuring 90cm or longer. Larger groups should be given much more territory. The substrate should consist of natural coloured sand or fine gravel, and dark shady areas should be provided with plenty of plants, bogwood, and caves. Java moss covered coconut shells or clean new flowerpots are particular favourite hideaways, and a pair is likely to choose such a location as a spawning site. Excellent water quality should be maintained at all times, and boisterous tankmates are not advised. If kept in cramped quarters, breeding pairs will become quite aggressive towards their tankmates, so adequate space must be provided.\nThis fish may have missed out on the common name Kribensis, but you\u2019ll often see it labelled as taeniatus until the new name gains wider use. As these are quite rare fish, you\u2019ll usually see a locality or strain name in combination, such as Bipindi, Dehane, Kienke, Lobe, Lokoundje, Makoure, Moliwe, Nange, Nyete and Wouri. As it turns out, most of the taeniatus forms in captivity are actually kribensis, as Cameroon was seemingly more widely explored by fish collectors than Nigeria. A second new species (P. drachensfelsi) from Cameroon was previously known as taeniatus 'Wouri' and has similar care requirements.",
        "feeding": "Flake, granules sinking pellets and small frozen foods such as daphnia, mosquito larvae, brineshrimp etc.",
        "breeding": "These fish are less common in aquaria due to the impact of pH on the sex of their offspring and a reluctance to spawn in harder water. Courting pairs are easy to spot as they select and modify a spawning site, with the female displaying her belly as a sign of her readiness to deposit eggs. The male\u2019s primary role is to defend the territory and he will require an outlet for this aggression to ensure that he does not direct this hormonally induced behaviour at his mate. Without a common enemy, many cichlid pairs tend to bicker, and a threat is required in the form of target fish (which must be able to escape the defended territory to safety for their own welfare) or even a mirror attached to the outside of one of the aquarium panes. Often, the first signs that spawning is occurring is when the pair disappear for some time into one of their favourite caves. Once the eggs have been deposited and fertilised, they will take approximately 5 days to hatch and a further 3 or 4 days to become free-swimming. A typical brood size would be around 40-50 young. The parents are very defensive of the fry and will be seen herding them around the aquarium, where they will forage on live foods such as newly hatched brine shrimp and microworms. Once the young fishes are independent it\u2019s best to remove them before the adults attempt to drive them away.",

        "care": "The Canara Pearlspot Chromide is a rare traded species and is one of only a handful of cichlids known from Asia. These beautiful fish are found only in a couple of freshwater rivers in the southwestern region of Canara (Kanara) in India. Unlike other members of the same genus, they are not brackish fish, being found some considerable distance from the coast. For best long-term health, and for breeding success, they will require soft, acidic water with no added salt. Quite unusually for a cichlid species, the CanaraPearlspot Chromide is best maintained in groups of 5 or more as it is of a placid nature, highly sociable, and thrives on the company of its own kind; the larger the shoal, the better. Tankmates could include barbs, danios, loaches, or rasboras. However, do not mix with any large, aggressive cichlids or other boisterous species. Ensure that the aquarium is mature, with good filtration and a high level of oxygenation (of particular importance when maintaining these riverine fish at the higher end of their preferred temperature range). The tank can beaquascaped with driftwood and robust plants such as Anubias sp. and Java which can be anchored to the decor. Be aware that although they will not actually uproot soft-leaved plants, they will eat them down to stumps in next to no time! Ensure that the aquarium receives regular partial water changes to keep the nitrate level to an absolute minimum. The Canara Pearlspot Chromide was once believed to be extinct in the wild, only to reappear at a Far East trade show in the early 1990s. This species is listed as Endangered on the IUCN red list of threatened species, largely due its restricted area of distribution and the decline in habitat quality due to pollution (agricultural and domestic sewage)and sand mining activity. Indonesian fish farms are now breeding this species in captivity to lessen pressure on wild stocks. However, the habitat degradation needs to be urgently addressed and it has been recommended that the Kumaradhara River be designated a freshwater sanctuary and no-take zone for fishermen; unfortunately, these recommendations have yet to be acted upon. Hobbyists can therefore play a vital role in protecting this species by purchasing captive-bred fish wherever possible and starting their own breeding projects.",

        "breeding": "The Canara Pearlspot Chromide is an aseasonal spawner and is reported to have been bred by only a handful of aquarists with details few and far between. This species would make an excellent breeding project for the serious hobbyist. A requisite for successful breeding seems to be very soft (<6 dH) water and prior conditioning on a very varied diet. The water temperature should be maintained towards the higher end of the preferred range for some time and this should be interrupted with large, cool water change to help simulate the rainy season. When ready to spawn, the fish undergo a significant colour/pattern change and they will begin quivering at one another. Several hundred eggs will be deposited/fertilized on a flat piece of decor, usually in a sheltered location. These will adhere to the chosen substrate via a relatively long filament \"This is thought to keepthe eggs well anchored in their native flowing waters and can be clearly seen the parents waft fresh water across the eggs with their pectoral fins. The eggs will be defended by both parents and hatching normally takes place in around 4 days, although this will be temperature dependent. There have been reports of the adults predating on the fry once they become free swimming, so it might be a good idea to separate them from the adults if you wish to raise a good number of young.",

        "care": "Given the long history of goldfish keeping, it\"\u2122s perhaps a surprise that yellow fish weren\"\u2122t widely kept until recently but they\"\u2122re certainly here to stay. Originally appearing as stocky, short-finned standard goldfish, further breeding has produced long finned and yellow & white forms. It\"\u2122s a colour that previously was more familiar in koi but it\"\u2122s apparent that these bright yellow fish compliment other forms such as sarasa comets and shubunkins beautifully. Goldfish should be kept in groups but these can consist of a mixture of varieties - just make sure that female fish aren\"\u2122t outnumbered by the more long-finned and lightly-built males, which chase them relentlessly during spawning.\nLike all hardy goldfish breeds, these are a great choice for the garden pond. Hardy and long-lived, they\"\u2122ll happily live amongst pond plants and don\"\u2122t place too much of a burden on filtration, even as mature fish. Not only do their colours complement other varieties but they\"\u2122ll freely interbreed, with fry showing the typical goldfish dark colouration that protects them from predators until they grow large enough to look after themselves.\nIn their long history as pets, it\"\u2122s become common practice to keep goldfish indoors in containers that are much too small for them. As you can imagine, housing a 30cm pond fish in a bowl is not ideal and a suitable indoor aquarium should be at least 100 litres in capacity and well-filtered for young specimens. Far better alternatives are available for indoor keeping and tropical fish are far easier and a good deal less work. If your heart is set on goldfish as a pet, consider starting with small fish in a large aquarium which can then be upgraded to a spacious pond as they grow \"\u201c obviously, this is only an option with pond-hardy varieties.\nGoldfish are hardy and adaptable fishes, but they prefer hard water and whether indoors or out and soft, acidic conditions are to be avoided. To minimise the stresses of cold winter weather and hot summer days, a fishpond should be at least 60cm (2\"\u2122) deep in places. During the coldest weather, this area should remain undisturbed by vigorous water circulation and will be used as a refuge from extreme cold.\nMay also be seen on sale as Lemon Goldfish.",

Mature goldfish will breed on a regular basis in established ponds so do make occasional checks to ensure that the pond is not becoming overstocked. In larger ponds, keeping fish that will consume the goldfish eggs - such as orfe - is a natural way of keeping the population in check. Goldfish lay their eggs amongst aquatic vegetation (or on artificial spawning mops) and these usually hatch within 48-72 hours depending on water temperature. Young goldfish are brown in colour (like their ancestors) and it can take up to a year before brighter colouration becomes apparent.",

Here these suckermouth catfish inhabit fast-flowing, highly oxygenated waters over a rocky substrate that provides a multitude of dark hiding places.\nThe aquarium should be mature, with a soft sand or fine rounded gravel substrate and various pieces of smooth rockwork and bogwood arranged to create lots of shady caves and crevices. As plants are not found in any great abundance in the natural habitat, they can be omitted from the aquascape, although a few areas of hardy vegetation (that can cope with current) will make the aquarium look more aesthetically pleasing and will help with water quality. There should be brisk water movement and a high level of oxygenation, perhaps provided by powerheads (in addition to the current generated by the filtration). Small frequent partial water changes will help keep nitrate to a minimum; as a riverine species these fish are rather sensitive to the build up of nitrogenous waste. The Candy Stripe Plec is generally peaceful, but it will show minor territorial aggression towards its own kind if not given enough space. In most instances though, they can be maintained in small groups as long as there is adequate room and enough hiding places to go round. Tankmates could include any small-medium sized peaceful shoaling fish that occupy the mid to upper levels of the water column and which also enjoy the fast-flowing conditions.\nThis species was erroneously confused with the Clown Plec (Panaque maccus) in older aquarium literature, a similar-looking fish that has very different care requirements.",

        "breeding": "Candy Stripe Plecs have been successfully bred in the home aquarium, and this is best achieved with a tank dedicated solely to this species. Provide several small caves that are just bigger than the fish (small pieces of slate stuck together with aquarium-safe silicon are ideal) and perform a series of small partial water changes with cooler water. RO is the best choice, so that the hardness of the water can be reduced slightly too. The female will visit the male's cave and if ready to spawn, she will spend some time in the cave and deposit the eggs. She will then be ousted from the cave, and the male will remain with the eggs, fanning them with his pectoral fins. It is said that spawning can sometimes be a little rough, and sometimes the female will come away with a few minor wounds. The eggs take around 6-7 days to hatch, although this will be temperature dependent. The wrigglers will feed from their yolk sacs for the first week or so, and after that they should be offered suitably sized foodstuffs such as newly hatched baby brineshrimp.",

        "care": "Cardinal tetras resemble their cousin the Neon tetra (P. innesi) but their German common name of Red Neon describes the main difference rather well - this fish displays a red belly lacking in its more mainstream relative. In the wild, these fishes inhabit clear water streams and creeks protected from extremes of temperature by the forest shade. Seasonal rains make for distinct changes in the habitat and the wet season allows adult fish to spawn amongst the marginal vegetation after sheltering among the leaf litter above the stream bed.\nCardinals are at their best in soft water, where they'll live longer, grow larger and show better colour. As with many small tetras, an almost annual life cycle is replaced with a longevity that can be measured in years in captivity. They're sociable fish but observations in the wild reveal that they often forage in modest numbers (5-15 individuals) before coming together to form larger shoals. There's no denying that fifty or more fish makes for a very impressive spectacle in the aquarium but groups of six or twelve will be content in most suitable aquaria. Natural habitats seem to feature leaf litter or aquatic plant cover and these are welcome components of a suitable home set up. These conditions are often found in planted aquaria filled with RO water and running CO2 supplementation.\nMost cardinals seen in shops are captive bred but an important sustainable export trade revolves around this species in its rainforest home. As the continued existence of these tetras is dependent on preservation of their habitat, the value of exports protects the fishery from destructive exploitation. For this reason, buying wild-collected fish should be considered as a positive conservation option - just remember that these Amazonian natives will be used to excellent water quality and low nitrates.\nIn addition to the unbeatable wild type, an albino form is seen which may be labelled as Gold. Lighting will accentuate different colours in these fish, red is more striking in brightly lit conditions",
        "feeding": "Offer a varied diet including a good quality flake, micropellets, and small frozen foods such as mosquito larvae and daphnia.",
        "breeding": "The water must be extremely soft and acidic, and because Cardinal Tetras are thought to lay their eggs in darkness, the spawning aquarium must be darkened. It is a good idea to place a grid or a layer of sterilised marbles on the bottom of the spawning tank in order to protect the eggs from the parents. The temperature should be set at the higher end of their range. Female Cardinal Tetras can lay upwards of 150 eggs, some report over 300. Once the eggs have been laid/fertilised, the pair should be acclimatised back to the main aquarium. As the eggs are photo-sensitive, they should remain in darkness, and should hatch within 36 hours. Once the fry have absorbed their yolk sacs and become free-swimming, much difficulty in feeding them ensues, this being due to their diminutive size. Infusoria and liquid fry foods should be offered, moving on to newly hatched brineshrimp after a week or so. Remember that the fry are also light-sensitive and should remain under very subdued lighting (and stable water conditions) for some time.",

These fish are known as 'continuous spawners' which means that the eggs are deposited over a period of some days/weeks, even months in some cases. The eggs should be removed to another tank (with matching water conditions) after each spawning, as otherwise the hungry parents will consume them. Each batch of eggs becomes progressively smaller. The eggs usually hatch within 7-14 days, the timescale being very dependent on water temperature. The fry are tiny and should be offered appropriately sized foodstuffs. Frequent partial water changes should be carried out with the utmost of care, as the fry are extremely sensitive to changes in their environment.",

Ideally, this is a species that will be maintained in groups of 10 or more in the home aquarium, not only for the fish to feel secure, but also to further the chances of breeding. Larger groups will also help to disperse any minor territorial squabbles between the males and this can be further aided by the inclusion of dense planting for the recipient to retreat into if needed. This fish should either be kept in a species-only aquarium, or else with other small, peaceful fish species only. Try to keep 2 or 3 females to every male. It may be of interest that the recently discovered, and as yet undescribed, beautiful little Rosy Loach (Petruichthys sp.) was found to be living alongside D. margaritatus in the wild.\n  Due to the sudden frenzied collection of D. margaritatus immediately following its introduction to the hobby, substantial damage occurred to much of its natural habitat and measures were put in place to protect wild fish and their environment, although it's now known to be more widely distributed than originally feared.

The parents may try to consume the eggs, a good reason to use profuse amounts of moss in the tank or even use some form of separating grid underneath so that the fertilised eggs can fall to safety. The eggs should hatch after 72 hours and the fry should become free-swimming 48-72 hours later, although these times will be affected by water temperature. The fry can be fed on infusoria, microworm, fine \"egg-layer\" powdered first foods or liquids, moving on to baby brineshrimp etc. It is not unusual to see this species spawning every 48 hours or so.",

It will not thrive in a standard community set-up, so be sure to meet its requirements for highly oxygenated swiftly-moving waters - ideally provided by powerful external canister filtration. As with many members of the Garra genus, this species can be a bit quarrelsome with its own kind, and is best kept either singly or in groups of 5 or more. In numbers less than this, they are likely to bicker amongst themselves (and similar species) every so often, \"greying out\" as they do so. The aquarium should be aquascaped with a soft sand or very fine rounded gravel substrate, and furnished with cobbles, smooth rocks, and bogwood pieces. Lighting can be fairly bright to encourage algae growth, which the fish will enjoy browsing on for the micro-organisms it may contain. Shady areas can be provided with the layout of the rockwork/bogwood, and by growing canopies of hardy plants such as Anubias sp or Java fern (both tied to the driftwood). Some thought should be given to creating a number of \"visual barriers\" within the aquarium at the time of aquascaping, so if any territorial disputes do arise, the fish can get away from the other's line of sight. Please be aware that Ceylon Stone Suckers are capable of climbing up the glass with ease, something they tend to do when newly imported or moved; therefore be absolutely sure the tank has tight fitting coverslides and that there are no small gaps that the fish can crawl out of e.g. where equipment power leads feed into the back of the hood. Tankmates for the upper levels of the tank could include some of the Barilius, Danio, Devario, Opsarius, and smaller members of the Puntius genera (research individual species to ensure compatibility before purchase though, as not every species from these genera will be suitable). For bottom dwelling tankmates, you could consider many of the peaceful botiid river loaches, the nemacheilid brook loaches, and the more robust members of the balitorid hillstream loach group. Although Ceylon Stone Suckers tend to be of a relatively peaceful nature, they can be quite boisterous at feeding times and are not recommended for housing alongside slow-moving laterally-compressed fish such as discus or angelfish (which do not benefit from the same water conditions anyway).",
        "feeding": "This species enjoys grazing on the micro-organisms found within algal growths in the aquarium; it should not be considered an algae-eater, as some sources erroneously suggest.

In such instances, the act of spawning has often gone unnoticed, and is only realised when the presence of small fry are found hiding amongst the decor.

Their tank must be mature and have myriad of hiding places amongst driftwood and thick vegetation, which should include floating species to help diffuse the light. Indian Almond Leaves (Terminalia catappa) are also very much appreciated as 'leaf litter', but these must be replaced on a regular basis as they gradually decompose. Filtration should be good but water movement gentle. Chameleon Fish should be maintained in pairs, or in a harem situation with one male and several females. Rival males can be rather aggressive towards one another in small aquaria. However, if the tank is more spacious (and heavily planted as detailed above) then it may be possible to keep more than one male, as there should be ample visual barriers and room for each male to establish his own territory. Tankmates, if desired, should be of similar size and of a peaceful nature, as well as tolerant of the lower temperatures this species prefers. Much attention must be paid to water quality since Chameleon Fish are somewhat delicate and do not tolerate elevated nitrates or swings in water chemistry. Acclimatise very carefully.

They are suitable for aquariums containing communities of small, peaceful fish only, as larger tankmates will regard them as a snack. Cherry shrimp are excellent algae eaters and will browse on many different algae types. Highly recommended for planted aquaria, they will not damage the plants, but instead, large groups of this species will keep the leaves free from algae. Floating plants seem to be particularly favoured, and these shrimps can often be seen 'hanging around' in the plant cover near the water's surface. Like most species of shrimp, a high nitrate level will not be tolerated; ensure high standards of water quality are maintained at all times. Cherry shrimp will moult regularly whilst growing, and the sudden appearance of perfectly formed shrimp casings on the floor of the aquarium can cause alarm to fishkeepers who have not seen this before. Once the shrimp has moulted, it will remain hidden for a time until the new shell hardens and it has a bit more protection.",

Whilst they can be maintained in quite a wide range of water conditions, they do not tend to breed in water that is too acidic, or in water with a temperature below 21 \u00b0C. The eggs are held underneath the female until hatching takes place (approx. 1 month) and will be visible as a yellow area on the abdomen. Unlike some species, the young do not go through a larval stage and are instead, born as miniature replicas of the adult shrimp. Many aquarists like to cover the intakes of power filters with fine sponges to prevent the tiny youngsters from being drawn in.",

Here it inhabits the still or slow-flowing waters of thickly-vegetated ditches, marshes, shallow ponds, swamps, and flooded areas such as rice paddies.

A mature, heavily planted tank would be ideal to showcase this species, as their colours intensify when settled into a well planted environment. Dark substrate and background choices, along with some spindly driftwood and shady caves will also help them to settle in. Tankmates should be of similar size and temperament and enjoy the same soft, acidic conditions. Filtration should be efficient but the flow very gentle as these fish are used to sluggish waters. The Cherryspot Rasbora (R. rubrodorsalis) occurs sympatrically over some of its range with the very similar-looking congener R. borapetensis.

Ideally, this will be shallow but long (and well covered) with a layer of marbles as a substrate and numerous clumps of fine-leaved plants. The temperature should be set at the higher end of the preferred range, and a gentle air driven sponge filter placed on the tank. A well-conditioned pair should be carefully acclimatised to the breeding aquarium, and spawning will either occur naturally when the first rays of morning sunlight hit the aquarium glass, or they can be triggered into spawning by performing a small, slightly cooler water change. Eggs will be scattered in batches amongst the plants and marbles, and most should fall to safety. Once spawning eventually appears to cease, the parent fish should be removed to avoid predation. The eggs are somewhat sensitive, but under good conditions should hatch within 24-48 hours (temperature dependent). The fry should become free-swimming a further 24-48 hours later and can be fed on infusoria, Artemia nauplii and finely crushed egg-layer first foods.",

        "care": "The Cherryspot Tropheus is known from the central eastern coast of Lake Tanganyika, where it is found amongst the rocky habitat, grazing algae in the sunlit shallows.\nCurrently these fishes are in need of classification and many of the forms are known as Tropheus sp. 'Black' or T. sp. 'Red' together with their location or common name. As hybridisation may occur, it's best to keep Tropheus in groups of their own kind and these should be large in number to spread the aggression. Housing 15 or more of these feisty fishes requires a large aquarium and this should be 1.5m or more in length to allow individuals to avoid one another. Smaller groups inevitably dwindle as harassment and bullying proves too much for the females and weaker males. It is important that the entire group is added at the same time to avoid the aggression which would otherwise be directed towards any newcomers. When adding large numbers of fish in this manner, it's important that the filtration is cycled and capable of handling the waste load. Given the investment involved, the use of a matured filter and bacterial inoculation with products such as Microbe Lift are strongly advised. As always, water quality should be very carefully monitored over the first few weeks. Excellent water quality must be maintained at all times, with partial water changes carried out at least once or twice a week and this may require the addition of buffers to ensure the high pH and carbonate hardness levels required. Strong water movement will ensure high oxygen levels and helps to keep the fish fit and active.\nAlthough Tropheus can be kept in fairly bare aquaria, several separate piles of rocks should be created (instead of a continuous rocky reef) so that individuals can more easily evade one another thanks to broken sight lines. Lighting should be bright to encourage the growth of algae over the decor, which these herbivores will enjoy browsing upon. Sharp rocks (such as lava rock) should not be used as they can cause damage to the mouths of these fishes as they graze.\nAside from a tendency to kill one another best controlled by keeping them in big groups, diet is the other major factor in successful care. These fishes are very prone to bloating caused by excessive quantities of rich food and this should be considered when mixing them with other species. Prospective tank mates should be able to thrive on the same diet and this may limit selection.",
        "feeding": "A staple diet based on algae such as spirulina is recommended, together with occasional feeds of high-fibre frozen foods such as Daphnia, Mysis and Cyclops. Avoid feeding these fishes too generously. Fine sand substrates may be useful in aiding gut health by providing beneficial indigestible matter.",
        "breeding": "Males should be outnumbered with females because of their constant desire to spawn, and this harassment (which can be quite intense) will then be spread, so that no one fish bears the brunt of the males' continual amorous attention. The trickiest part of conditioning females is ensuring they have sufficient opportunity to avoid being pestered by males. Properly kept, breeding occurs naturally and females mouth brood a small clutch (<20) of very large eggs for three weeks or more. Maternal care continues a little longer and fry are capable of feeding inside their mother's mouth. Young fish are preferentially released in shallow water with rich algal growth and fewer predators - having rockwork reaching the surface or piles of small stones will provide suitable areas.",

These fish are an ideal choice for small, heavily planted softwater aquaria. The tank must be mature and have myriad of hiding places amongst driftwood and thick vegetation, which should include floating species to help diffuse the light. Filtration should be good but water movement gentle. These peaceful shoaling fish can be rather timid, so a decent sized group of 12 or more will help them to feel more secure. A larger group will also result in a more effective, natural-looking shoal, with males displaying their best colours as they compete with one another for female attention. Tankmates, if desired, must also be small and peaceable; for example, small Caridina and Neocaridina shrimp, Kuhli loaches (Pangio spp.), Otocinclus catfish, pygmy Corydoras spp., Eirmotus octozona, Trigonostigma spp., and Blue Eyes (Pseudomugil spp.) could all be considered suitable. Much attention must be paid to water quality since Chilli Rasboras are somewhat delicate and do not tolerate elevated nitrates or swings in water chemistry. Acclimatise very carefully. This species is very similar in appearance to its congener B. urophthalmoides, the Spice Rasbora; these two species being the only members of the genus that possess a dark lateral body stripe. However, they can be told apart as follows: B. brigittae attains a larger adult size and displays an insignificant dark blotch on the caudal peduncle (vs. very obvious caudal blotch in B. urophthalmoides) plus B. brigittae tends to be a brighter red colour overall. In some cases, the lateral dark stripe on B. brigittae is broken rather than one solid line, and sometimes the tiny caudal blotch is absent.",

In densely planted aquaria with large groups of well-conditioned B. brigittae, spawnings should occur regularly with eggs being scattered over vegetation and decor. The eggs and resultant tiny larvae will be seen as food by the adults, but if there is plenty of plant cover, some should survive into adulthood. If a greater number of fry is desired, a separate bare-bottomed breeding aquarium (with air powered sponge filter) should be set up with plenty of Java moss/spawning mops and a layer of mesh raised a small way from the tank bottom so that any eggs that fail to adhere to the plants/mops fall through to safety, away from the adults. The water conditions should match that of the main aquarium. Carefully add one or two well-conditioned pair/s of B. brigittae, and once settled they should spawn the following morning. It is recommended that the adults are moved back to the main aquarium within 48 hours as the first eggs will be starting to hatch by then. The miniscule fry will feed off their yolk sacs to begin with, but will soon require suitably sized foodstuffs such as infusoria and Paramecium, moving on to slightly bigger foods such as Artemia nauplii as they grow. A variety of foods may be needed for a while as you may end up with fry of slightly different sizes from the 2 days of continual spawning. Small partial water changes must be carried out with the utmost of care to avoid shocking the extremely delicate fry.",

Depending on your location, a means of chilling the water may be needed during the warmest parts of the year. As with all botiids, these loaches must only be added to aquariums that are biologically mature. Create a multitude of hiding spots and 'visual barriers' with smooth rounded rocks, cobbles, and pebbles of varying sizes. Ensure that the substrate has no sharp edges as these loaches will enjoy digging around the bottom of the tank in their search for titbits of food, and it is important that nothing damages their delicate sensory barbels.

He will choose and clean a spawning site, then display to the female fish until one accepts him. They will circle each other in a head to tail manner a number of times, until the female deposits her eggs. These are deposited just one or two at a time and after doing so, she immediately turns around and picks them up. At the same time, the male will rotate so that he is almost on his side, at the same time shaking and extending his anal fin, releasing his milt. The female sees the egg spots on the male's anal fin and attempts to pick up those \"eggs\" whilst she is picking up the real ones that she deposited, and at the same time taking in milt. This is the method of fertilisation, and this ritual may go on for some hours. The eggs may be incubated for up to 25 days until they hatch and the resultant fry held for a further few days afterwards. Typical brood size for a good sized female would number between 10-20.",

Good companions could include Uaru, Angelfish, Severums, silver dollars, and large armoured catfish. Chocolate Cichlids are mildly aggressive towards conspecifics and as such are best maintained singly or as a compatible pair.

When ready, the female will swim over the spawning site in a series of \"dry runs\", after which she will begin depositing eggs in small batches. The male immediately follows behind her and fertilises them, and this is repeated until several hundred eggs are laid/fertilised. The act of spawning has been known to continue for well over an hour in some cases, after which time, the parents will guard the eggs diligently, hovering above and fanning them with their pectoral fins. After a couple of days, both parents will move the eggs to a pre-dug pit in the substrate and resume sentry duty once more. The eggs should hatch after a couple more days, and the young should be free-swimming after a further 3 days. At this point they can be offered baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and crushed flake foods. Both fish provide excellent parental care, collecting any fry that swim too far from the brood, and bringing them back to the nest site. Brood care continues for a further 2-3 weeks.",

A dark coloured substrate and background will also help the fish to feel more confident and will bring out their best colours. Filtration should be efficient but water movement gentle, and we'd suggest the use of aquarium botanicals to help emulate the natural water conditions. The addition of leaf litter would further help in this respect - dried Indian Almond leaves (Terminalia catappa) are ideal and are readily available. Much attention must be paid to water quality since Chocolate Gouramis will not tolerate elevated nitrates or swings in water chemistry; small partial water changes should be carried out on a frequent basis. These fish are best maintained in small groups of 6 or more to dissipate their territorial aggression and a large aquarium will provide room to avoid conflict. If tankmates are desired, they should be small, peaceful, and thrive under soft, acidic conditions.

The young will require baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) or microworm straight away. In a densely planted tank, some fry may survive, but if you wish to raise larger numbers, they should be separated from the parents once free-swimming.

        "care": "The Chocolate Talking Catfish is a secretive species known from the calm waters of tropical swamps and mangroves, where it remains hidden under roots, rocks, and plant thickets during the day. Active by night, the Chocolate Talking Catfish emerges to feed by digging through the sediment, consuming various organic debris, insect larvae, and small benthic invertebrates. More often than not, this species shows up in small numbers as a by-catch in imports of Striped Dora/Humbug Catfish (Platydoras armatulus), but stand alone imports of larger numbers have been known. It is important to provide a soft sand substrate in order to protect the delicate sensory barbels, and be sure to make a good number of shady hiding places available such as slate caves, driftwood, and PVC pipes for these nocturnal fish to take refuge in during the day - as they do not enjoy bright illumination. Robust plants, including floating species, can also be utilised to help diffuse the lighting, and these will provide additional hiding places. This is a gregarious species which benefits from company of its own kind, so aim for a group of 5 or more of similar size. Adding a blue moon light to your aquarium (which switches on just before the main lights go out) will allow you  to spend time observing them under their preferred subdued lighting. Adding some suitable \"\u02dcdither fish\"\u2122 to the aquarium may also encourage them to venture out a little more during the daytime, and some of the medium sized characins, barbs, rainbowfish, and peaceable cichlids make great companions. They can also be kept successfully alongside other doradids. However, be aware that Chocolate Talking Catfish are micro-predators with capacious mouths which do actively hunt at night, so be sure that any tankmates are not of such a small size that they would become an easy snack. Doradid catfish are often referred to as \"talking catfish\" on account of their ability to produce audible sounds via stridulation of the pectoral spines in their sockets and amplifying this sound through the swim bladder. This fish is very similar to its congener A. spinosissimus; however, they can be told apart by the presence of pale blotches on the dorsal surface between the dorsal fin and caudal fin in A. spinosissimus, versus no blotches in that area in A. cataphractus. Confusingly though, both species tend to be sold under the same common names. Take care when moving these catfish, as the pectoral fin spines and body scutes can easily become entangled in netting, and can pierce the skin. It is best to herd the fish into a solid container rather than lifting directly from the water with a net. May also be seen on sale as Chocolate Raphael or Spiny Catfish.",

The temperature of the water should be raised to 28 \u00b0C and it must be extremely well-filtered and highly oxygenated. Provide a selection of small caves which have an entrance only marginally bigger than the fish. These can either be formed from arranging the rockwork in such a way that small, secluded crevices are created, or pre-constructed from small pieces of slate siliconed together. It is crucial that these caves are situated in an area with decent water movement. When in spawning condition, males will choose a preferred cave and defend it from any other males present, whilst at the same time, will try to entice a ripe female inside. Spawning does not always take place straight away; indeed, it can be some days before the female is ready to deposit her eggs, but the fish will remain inside the cave together during this time, the male usually blocks the entrance. Once the eggs have been laid and fertilised, the male fish often has to force the female out of the cave before he begins his parental guarding duties. The female plays no further part in brood care, but the male will be seen fanning the eggs with his pectoral fins and blocking the cave entrance from any intruders. Eggs typically number around 45 and take around a week to hatch. The fry will feed from their sizeable yolk sacs for the first few days, and after this has been consumed, they will require very regular feedings of baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii), microworms, and various small or crushed dried sinking foods. It is important that food is available to the fry at all times as they can all too easily starve but keep a very close eye on water quality when feeding constantly and perform lots of very regular but very small partial changes to keep nitrogenous waste levels as low as possible. The adults pose no threat to the fry, but other fish sharing the same tank might do. This is why many aquarists like to keep these catfish in a species-only set up, to further their chances of raising the maximum number of young.",

        "care": "The Clown Goby Cichlid is known from the southern end of Lake Tanganyika, from Moliro on the western shore, around to Kipili on the eastern side, where it lives exclusively in the surge zone. Here, the coastal waters are shallow and highly oxygenated, with strong currents and pummelling wave action. These fascinating bottom-dwelling cichlids are mostly solitary and spend much of their time hopping around amongst pebbles, feeding on algae and the microscopic organisms living within it. Clown Goby Cichlids have specialised dentition to assist them with scraping the algae from rocks, and a much reduced swimbladder that helps them negate buoyancy and keep their position on the substrate. The aquarium that houses these fish should be biologically mature, with a soft sand substrate and plenty of smooth pebbles and cobbles. Filtration should be efficient with areas of brisk water movement along with some quieter resting spots out of the current. There should be a decent level of oxygenation, and small frequent partial water changes will help keep nitrate to a minimum. Lighting can be fairly bright to encourage algae growth over the stones. Clown Goby Cichlids are territorial towards conspecifics, but should not be kept alongside aggressive species. Ideally, tankmates will be of similar size and occupy different areas of the aquarium to the goby cichlids, such as Cyprichromis or Paracyprichromis spp which tend to stay higher up in the water column. It is best to keep Clown Goby Cichlids singly or as a compatible pair, and it should be noted that once a pair forms, the bond is lifelong. The aquarium must be very spacious if more than one pair are to be kept together, with plenty of visual barriers amongst the decor. Not to be kept alongside other goby cichlids from the Spathodus and Tanganicodus genera.",
        "feeding": "Primarily herbivorous. Feed once a day on green (Spirulina) flakes and standard flakes (alternate with the green) and small sinking cichlid pellets for herbivores. Occasionally provide pieces of Nori, Romaine lettuce, blanched spinach etc. Frozen cyclops and daphnia are also safe and can be used as a treat. Ensure bright lighting is used to encourage natural algal growth. NEVER feed with protein-rich mosquito larvae, beef heart, Tubifex etc as this will lead to bloat, which can be fatal.",
        "breeding": "Bi-parental mouthbrooder. This species has been bred in the home aquarium, but it is not a frequent occurrence. It would make a great breeding project for the serious hobbyist. When ready to spawn, the female selects a suitable flat rock as a spawning site and cleans it thoroughly. The pair will then display to one another whilst circling the spawning site. The female subsequently deposits one or two relatively large eggs, and then immediately turns to take them up into her mouth as the male simultaneously fertilises them. This is repeated until the female is spent of eggs, which may number 10-25 depending on her size/maturity. The eggs are carried in the mouth of the female for around 14 days, during which time she will not feed, and will be easily recognisable by her distended mouth. Once the eggs hatch, the female then transfers the fry to the mouth of the male one or two at a time. He will then continue incubating the fry for a further 7-14 days until they have absorbed their yolk sacs, before releasing them (usually at night) a few at a time and ensuring they each find hiding places. There is no need to immediately remove the parent fish or fry if they are in a species-only aquarium, as the parents will tolerate the fry for a reasonable period of time. In Tanganyikan community aquaria, however, it would be best to move the mouthbrooding male to a tank with no predators, before he is due to release the fry. Once they have been released, he may then be acclimatised back to the main aquarium. The free-swimming fry can be offered crushed Spirulina flake and baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii). The fry are slow-growing and will typically reach 2.5cm (1\") in length after around 4 months.",

        "care": "These tiny panchax are known from coastal swamps and shallow, slow-moving waters of forest creeks and rivulets. These diminutive killifish are gregarious and are found in loose shoals living amongst the dense marginal vegetation. The home aquarium should be biologically mature with high standards of water quality maintained at all times. Clown killies are delicate fish and require very soft, acidic water with plenty of cover in the form of driftwood and plants. Peat filtration would be very beneficial in helping to create the ideal conditions, and this can be further enhanced with the addition of dried Indian almond leaves (Terminalia catappa) or alder cones. Water movement must be kept as gentle as possible, and dark substrate and decor choices will help to bring out the vibrant colour of these tiny fish. Lighting should be fairly dim, although brighter lighting can be employed if there is plenty of surface cover in the form of floating plants such as Azolla, Ceratopteris, or Pistia species. Always maintain this peaceful top-dweller in good sized groups. Many aquarists like to keep them in a dedicated species-only set-up that is tailored specifically to their needs, but they can be kept alongside other tiny peaceable species such as African Jellybean Tetras (Ladigesia roloffi), Ember Tetras (Hyphessobrycon amandae), pencilfish, Pygmy Corydoras, Boraras spp., and some of the smaller anabantoids. These fish can be particularly sensitive to fluctuating or deteriorating water conditions and are regarded as somewhat difficult to keep. We therefore recommended this species for experienced aquarists only. Ensure that the aquarium has tight fitting coverslides as these fish are expert jumpers.

        "breeding": "Rocket Panchax are relatively easy to breed, and in densely planted aquaria, small numbers of fry are likely appear from time to time. However, if you wish to raise a larger number of young, a separate breeding aquarium should be set up for this purpose. A small tank filled with water from the main tank, filtered by a simple air-driven sponge filter, and fitted with a small sized heater to keep the temperature stable, along with several large clumps of Java Moss or spawning mops is all that is required. Acclimatise well-conditioned fish (either a pair, or one male with 2 or 3 females) to the breeding aquarium, and spawning should occur quite readily and without too much intervention (sometimes a small water change is required to get them started). The miniscule eggs will be scattered over the spawning medium, and incubation typically takes around 9-14 days depending on the water temperature. Some aquarists like to move the adults back to the main aquarium after a good number of eggs have been deposited, yet others leave them in situ because they rarely predate on their own eggs or fry. However, larger fry may predate on much smaller fry, so larger youngsters should be acclimatised to the main aquarium as soon as they are big enough. Newly-hatched fry will require feeding with cultured infusoria and tiny rotifers, moving on to slightly bigger foodstuffs such as vinegar eels and baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) as they grow. Vinegar eels are especially useful as a growing-on food as they tend to stay towards the top of the water, which is the area the fry will primarily feed from, so there is less wastage and less danger of fouling the water. If the clumps of plants that are used in the breeding aquarium are mature specimens, the fry will likely browse on the microorganisms present as an additional source of food. It is essential that high standards of water quality are maintained throughout. Many breeders like to add a good amount of live Daphnia to the spawning tank. The adult Daphnia will consume bacteria and other microscopic life in the water column until they themselves are eaten. The Daphnia do not harm the eggs or even newly hatched fry.",

        "care": "Clown Loaches are a giant among loaches. They are the most commonly available loach species in the fishkeeping hobby, although given their potential adult size, they really shouldn't be. Many newcomers to the hobby are instantly drawn to the beautiful bright 1-2\" fishes often offered for sale, unaware of just how large these cute \"little\" loaches will grow. Under the right conditions, they grow quite quickly, and adults will eventually require an aquarium measuring at least 6\" x 2\" x 2\". Even small specimens of this species must initially be housed in an aquarium that is 4ft long as a minimum. Anything smaller can cause these fast-swimming fish to become stunted and stressed. Clown loaches are often a life-long commitment; indeed, when cared for properly, they live for decades rather than years (some reports suggest up to 50 years), so this is something the aquarist must think seriously about. Clown loaches, like other members of the family Botiinae, are very social creatures, and MUST be maintained in groups of at least 5, and preferably more. They form highly complex social structures within the group, and their physical health will suffer if they don't have contact with their own kind. Adding some suitable \"dither fish\" to the aquarium may encourage them to venture out a little more during the daytime, and species from the barb, danio, rasbora, and tetra families make great companions. The aquarium should be well filtered with a decent amount of current and aeration. The substrate should consist of fine smooth sand in order to protect the delicate sensory barbel area, and numerous shady hiding places, in the form of bogwood and caves should be provided. Small partial water changes of 10-15% at a time should be carried out at least twice a week. Nitrates should be kept below 40ppm at all times. Clown loaches are often recommended for tanks with a snail problem.

        "care": "The Clown Rasbora is a medium-sized, peaceful, shoaling species that is ideal for spacious softwater aquaria. The tank should be mature with plenty of dark decor including tangles of driftwood and robust planting. Lighting should be fairly dim, but slightly brighter illumination is acceptable if there are plenty of floating plants or large, broad leaved plants to diffuse the light and create an abundance of shady areas. As these fish inhabit very acidic, tannin-stained softwater forest swamps in the wild, we would suggest using peat filtration on the aquarium to help create blackwater conditions. The aforementioned driftwood will also help in this respect, as would adding (and replacing when necessary) a handful of dried Indian almond leaves (Terminalia catappa)to the aquarium. Tannin-stained water also helps to bring out the beautiful red colors of these fish. At one time, it was widely believed that Clown Rasboras were not particularly sociable, but this is not the case if maintained correctly. Ideally, the tank will be at least 4ft long, as these are active fish, and the group should contain an absolute minimum of 12 specimens. Kept in more cramped conditions and in insufficient numbers, problems with aggression between males are far more likely to arise. A good-sized group also has the advantage of being more likely to contain a mix of sexes, which means that the males will frequently display to the females, and will exhibit their most dazzling colors. An aggression will also be spread out amongst the group, and not focussed on any one particular fish, especially if given adequate swimming space and visual barriers amongst the decor. Tankmates should be of similar size andtemperament; ideal companions could include some of the eel loaches (Pangio spp.), small peaceful barbs (suchas P. foerschi, P. pentazona, or P.rhomboocellatus), and Chocolate gouramis. Looking further afield, many of the medium sized South American tetras and Corydoras catfish also make excellent tankmates. Ensure that the tank has tightly fitting coverslides, as these fish are accomplished jumpers. This species is regarded as quite delicate and should never be added to a biologically immature aquarium; likewise, swings in water chemistry and high nitrates must be avoided. A very similar-looking, but less frequently traded species, Rasbora kottelati, may be mistaken for theClown Rasbora; however, it can be told apart from R. kalochroma as it has a dark crescent-shaped mark on the caudal peduncle (absent in R. kalochroma).

Ideally, this will be shallow but long (and well-covered) with a layer of marbles as a substrate and numerous clumps of fine-leaved plants. The temperature should be set to 27-28 \u00b0C, and a gentle air-driven sponge filter placed on the tank. Lighting is not necessary. A well-conditioned pair should be carefully acclimatized to the breeding aquarium, and spawning can be triggered by performing a small, slightly cooler water change. Eggs will be scattered in batches amongst the plants and marbles, and most should fall to safety. Once spawning eventually appears to cease, the parent fish should be removed to avoid predation. The eggs are somewhat sensitive, but under good conditions hatch within 24-36 hours (temperature dependent). The fry should become free-swimming a further 24-48 hours later and can be fed on infusoria, Artemia nauplii and finely crushed egg-layer first foods.",

        "care": "The Cobalt Blue Goby is known from clear, shallow, tropical streams, often in the rapids section preceding waterfalls. Here the water is saturated with oxygen and the substrate consists largely of bedrock with scattered cobbles/boulders. These rocks are covered with a luxuriant, nutritious biofilm (known as aufwuchs) which forms under the favourable shallow, sunny conditions. Riparian vegetation lines the banks of these streams, which over time deposit leaf litter into the water. True aquatic plants are generally not present and few other fish inhabit these specialised environments, with the exception of one or two other species of goby and loach; however, several shrimps and snails are often found living sympatrically. It is important that an aquarium for these fish is planned out in advance so that all their requirements are fully met. These fish have evolved to live in fast-flowing waters, where they use their modified pelvic disc to maintain their position on rocks amongst rapids. This high-velocity habitat must be replicated in the home aquarium by use of extra powerheads (in addition to the return flow from oversized filters) to create a river type effect. The surface of the water should be visibly moving to ensure that there is a high amount of oxygenation within the water at all times. An additional air-pump is also a handy back-up. Lighting should be bright to encourage algal growth on all the submerged surfaces in the aquarium, which will then become home to a plethora of micro-organisms upon which the fish will constantly graze. Without such a high level of oxygenation and water movement, and an ongoing natural food source, these gobies will not fare well at all. The substrate could consist of sand or small-grained smooth gravel, to which water-worn pebbles, cobbles, and small boulders should be added. As these fish like to dig (especially the males) it is a good idea to place larger rocks on the base of the aquarium before adding substrate, otherwise they could undermine the structures later on. Ensure that any driftwood pieces have been well-soaked prior to adding to the aquarium, in order that the leaching of tannins is minimal (as clearer water will promote better algal growth under artificial illumination). Keep at least 2 females to every male, and if keeping a group that consists of more than one male, be sure to create some visual barriers amongst the decor to limit territorial aggression. Although aquatic plants are not really a feature of the natural habitat of these gobies, they may make the aquarium more aesthetically pleasing; however, because of the brisk conditions, choose only robust species such as Anubias and Microsorum that can be anchored to the decor, or the slender, flowing Cryptocoryne balansae which can be planted into the substrate and can handle current. It is essential that the tank has tightly fitting coverslides with no escape holes where equipment feeds into the tank (such gaps should be plugged with coarse filter foam), as these fish are not only accomplished jumpers, but they can also climb up the aquarium glass. Tankmates should be peaceful and able to thrive in these specialist conditions. Good companions could include some of the hillstream loach species, other small torrent gobies, white cloud mountain minnows (Tanichthys albonubes), small danionins etc. Although frequent partial water changes are vital for these fishes wellbeing (ideally 30% or so each week) it is not necessary to go overboard with cleaning algae off of the glass or decor; indeed, it should be allowed to colonise all surfaces except for the front viewing panel as this provides an ongoing source of nourishment for them. Whilst these fish do not tend to graze on the tough black-brush algae, they will enjoy browsing on various other types for the associated micro-organisms, including diatoms, green algae, benthic/epiphytic algae, and even the dreaded blue-green 'algae' (Cyanobacteria). To provide additional grazing opportunities, some aquarists like to culture algae on rocks in a separate tank - this need only be a small glass container that could be kept in sunlight on a windowsill for example - and the rocks rotated with those in the main aquarium. May also be seen on sale as the Blue Neon Goby or Opal Cling Goby, and is all too often erroneously labelled as S. atropurpureus or S. elegans. Must only ever be added to mature aquaria.",
        "feeding": "Although these fish will graze upon the natural algae within the aquarium for the small micro-organisms it contains, the diet must be supplemented with vegetable matter (blanched spinach, kale etc) as well as good quality sinking algae wafers/pellets. Small meaty frozen foods such as bloodworm, white mosquito larvae, daphnia, etc should only be offered sparingly because the lengthy digestive tract is adapted to primarily process vegetable matter, and too much protein will cause health problems.",
        "breeding": "This species has not been bred in the home aquarium, although some aquarists have observed courtship behaviour with the male taking on intense colouration as he tries to entice females to his chosen spawning site. In the wild, adult fish reproduce using a amphidromous breeding strategy with spawning occurring in their preferred fast-flowing freshwater habitats. The female deposits several thousand minuscule eggs, which the male guards for around 24 hours, until they hatch into larvae and drift out to sea whilst steadily absorbing their yolk sacs. After a few months of developing under marine conditions, the larvae swim several kilometres back inland, gradually metamorphosing into tiny versions of the adult fish. Once back in freshwater, they navigate upstream into the shallow, fast-flowing streams that they reside in as adults, a difficult journey of several months where they often have to negotiate their way past cataracts, steep slopes, and waterfalls. The juveniles are sexually mature within 12 months.",

D\u00c3\u00a9cor such as ocean rock can be used to build sturdy structures which stretch from the base of the tank to near the surface of the water.

Other Maylandia species are best avoided though, particularly those of similar appearance, as males will respond most aggressively towards look-a-likes. Many Maylandia species are also capable of cross-breeding, something which should be avoided to keep the species pure.",
        "feeding": "The diet should be primarily vegetarian. Foods rich in animal protein could cause Malawi Bloat, which can be fatal. A good quality Spirulina-based green flake should be mixed with a standard quality flake food, and offered along with appropriately sized granular foods specifically developed for Mbuna. An occasional treat of Mysis shrimp can be given, but this should only be offered very occasionally. Vegetable matter such as cucumber, blanched spinach and romaine lettuce can be fed on a regular basis.",
        "breeding": "When ready to spawn, the colouration of the male will intensify and his aggression level will heighten. He will choose and clean a spawning site, then display to the female fish until one accepts him. They will circle each other in a head to tail manner a number of times, until the female deposits her eggs. These are deposited just one or two at a time and after doing so, she immediately turns around and picks them up. At the same time, the male will rotate so that he is almost on his side, at the same time shaking and extending his anal fin, releasing his milt. The female sees the egg spots on the male\"\u2122s anal fin and attempts to pick up those \"\u0153eggs\"\u009d whilst she is picking up the real ones that she deposited, and at the same time taking in milt. This is the method of fertilisation, and this ritual may go on for some hours. The eggs may be incubated for up to 25 days until they hatch and the resultant fry held for a further few days afterwards.",

        "care": "In the wild, 'Apistos' tend to inhabit slow-moving shallow bodies of water with a substrate is composed mainly of leaf litter, providing a matrix of hiding places. Their aquarium should reflect this and though they thrive in a tank furnished with catappa leaves, they'll be equally at home in shelters made from bogwood or ceramics. Dense planting helps to break up the sight lines and ease territorial conflict, these are cichlids after all and just as aggressive as their larger relatives, albeit on a much smaller scale. They may be dwarves but it's unwise to attempt to keep more than one male in all but the largest of set ups. Females are equally territorial but control much smaller territories and multiple females are usually found within the male's defended area. In small aquaria these fishes can be kept in pairs but if housing more than one female then allow around 30-50cm of tank length for each one and expect all other bottom-dwelling species to be expelled from these areas. \nAlthough requiring consideration for their aggression when breeding, apistos are clever little fishes and associate the absence of other fish as a warning of potential danger. In order to feel secure, they require 'dither fish' in the form of shoaling tetras etc which would quickly dart to safety at the approach of a predator, thus providing an early warning system. If these other species prefer swimming in the higher levels of the water column then they will usually thrive, quickly learning to avoid parental fish as long as space allows. As members of the Eartheater family, Apistos don't generally eat their tankmates and enjoy sifting through a sandy substrate for fine particles of food. Soft water is preferred, although this is less important for day to day care, with low nitrate levels being far more important to health. \nSeveral tank-bred colour varieties of A. cacatuoides are available, such as Double Red, Triple Red, and Orange. As well as these forms distinguished by fin colouration, a Gold or xanthic form is occasionally seen. Wild types are rarely offered, as their colouration is far more subdued.",

Maternal fish, which advertise their intentions by displaying a bold black and yellow pattern, will select or construct a spawning cave and this may be too small for the male to enter. The male's larger size enables him to cope with the heightened aggression of his mate and he may be excluded from parental duties completely. His role is to guard the territory while the female carries out the brood care. The eggs should hatch after 3 or 4 days, depending on water temperature. The female continues guarding the wrigglers, and after a further 4 or 5 days, will lead the fry out of the cave. She will be very pugnacious at this point, fending off any would-be predators and communicating with the fry using movements of her pelvic fins. The fry will require frequent small feeds with appropriately sized foodstuffs at this point, such as baby brineshrimp and microworm. With full bellies and plenty of partial water changes, the young fish will grow rapidly and should be removed for growing on when the female loses interest in them. Once independent they are driven from the territory and their mother will often spawn again.",

        "care": "The Coffee Bean Tetra is a highly sought after characin, originating from slow-moving tributaries of the Araguari river in north-eastern Brazil. There are some reports of this species also being found in the Oyapock river system in French Guiana, but details are very sketchy. This is a peaceful shoaling species, ideal for mature softwater aquaria. The tank should be furnished with plenty of driftwood to create lots of shady areas, and the tannins that are gradually released from the wood should help to acidify the water whilst giving it a natural, clear tea-colour. Peat filtration can also help in this respect. Although plants are not found in any great abundance in the natural waters of this species, a moderate amount of planting will be appreciated and will help to make the fish feel more secure. Lighting should not be too bright (tannins and floating plants can help to diffuse brighter lighting), and darker substrate and background choices will help to show off their beautiful colours. Coffee Bean Tetras should always be maintained in good sized groups, 6 would be the minimum recommended, 10+ would be better. Not only will the fish feel more secure, but this will result in a far more effective, natural-looking shoal. Tankmates should also be small and peaceful, as these fish are easily intimidated by larger or more rowdy species. Ideal tankmates could include Corydoras catfish, small dwarf cichlids such as Apistogramma or Mikrogeophagus, pencilfish, and some of the smaller Loricariidae (suckermouth catfish). At present Coffee Bean Tetras still command quite a high price tag, but they are currently being bred in good numbers in Europe and so are becoming more readily available (and at slightly more affordable prices) in the trade.",

        "breeding": "This egg-laying species is reported to be relatively easy to breed by those who are captive breeding them in the trade. In the confines of a well planted tank, you may see small numbers of young appear from time to time. However if you wish to raise a good number of fry, a small separate breeding aquarium should be set up for the purpose. This tank should also contain soft, acidic water, and the temperature should be set towards the high end of their preferred range. Prior to the spawning attempt, condition your fish on plenty of small meaty live or frozen foods. Clumps of Java moss or a few bunches of fine-leaved plants should be added to the breeding tank to give the fish somewhere to scatter their eggs, and very gentle filtration should be provided via an air-driven sponge filter. No dedicated lighting should be used, as eggs and fry can be a little light sensitive. Acclimatise a mix of both sexes across to the new tank very carefully during the evening, and in the morning, when sunlight hits the tank, spawning should commence. The parents should be removed immediately after spawning ceases as they will predate on the eggs (up to 500 eggs may be scattered during a spawning event). Some aquarists like to use a fine mesh in the tank so that the scattered eggs can fall to safety, away from the attention of the adult fish. Ideally try and keep the tank in darkness once eggs have been scattered, to protect them and the resultant sensitive young fry from being damaged by bright light. Once the eggs have hatched, the young will feed from their yolk sacs for a short time. Once free-swimming, microscopic foodstuffs such as infusoria/Paramecium should then be offered, followed by baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and microworm as they grow.",

In the wild, the Colombian Giant Ramshorn Snail lives in lakes, rivers, and swamps, preferring calm areas with dense vegetation. It is known to withstand lightly brackish conditions, but will not reproduce in saline waters. In some countries, this species was deliberately released to help control certain invasive aquatic plants, such is its penchant for munching through most things green and leafy. These snails are great for peaceful community tanks and often breed if conditions are to their liking (see below). Avoid keeping them in aquaria that contain loaches, pufferfish or any large/aggressive species. The water should be moderately hard and alkaline to allow for healthy shell development. In softer water, where the calcium concentration will be lower, the snails will be very prone deterioration of the shell. It is best to maintain a slightly dropped water line so that the snails may use their breathing siphon if they choose to \" this resembles a little snorkel. However, do ensure that the coverslides are kept tightly shut to create a space with warm humid air, and this also serves to eliminate any escape holes. Ensure the tank is well filtered and that regular partial water changes are carried out, at the same time vacuuming the substrate to ensure that the mulm that can accumulate from the snail's waste products is removed. Never use treatments containing copper in the snail aquarium. The majority of Colombian Giant Ramshorns bear the typical striking striped pattern. The large shell is relatively flat, the underside being a light beige or yellow colour, and the upper side a contrasting shade of darkest brown, sometimes with a reddish tint. A plain yellow colour variant does exist.",

Young fry may be found in freshwater, but these soon move into more saline waters as they mature in to juveniles. Adults must be kept in brackish to full marine conditions. For best results use a trusted synthetic marine sea salt and a hydrometer or refractometer to monitor the conditions. This is a nervous, active species which attains a large size, and is best maintained in groups of 5 or more due to a tightly shoaling nature. The aquarium must be very spacious (at least 8ft x 2ft x 2ft) and have a soft sand substrate. The tank should be aquascaped to include some shadier areas amongst large driftwood pieces, rockwork, or resin mangrove roots, with an unobstructed swimming area left along the front of the tank. If plants are desired, it is best to use plastic or silk examples, as most species will not fare well under salty conditions. A decent amount of filtration should be employed and areas of vigorous water movement created in the aquarium via additional powerheads. This will also help to keep oxygen levels high. Sensitive to pollutants, the aquarium water should be kept in excellent condition at all times with frequent partial water changes. Archer Fish, Monodactylus, and various Scats make great companions, avoiding any small fish which would be eaten. Be sure to cover the tank well as all these fish are expert jumpers. Interestingly, Colombian Shark Catfish are capable of producing audible sounds by rubbing the pectoral fins against their sockets, thought to be utilised for communication and echo-location.

Provide a selection of small caves which have an entrance only marginally bigger than the fish  these can either be formed from arranging the rockwork in such a way that small secluded crevices are created, or pre-constructed from small pieces of slate siliconed together. It is crucial that these caves are situated in an area with decent water movement. When in spawning condition, males will choose a preferred cave and defend it from any other males present, whilst at the same time, will try to entice a ripe female inside. Spawning does not always take place straight away, indeed it can be some days before the female is ready to deposit her eggs, but the fish will remain inside the cave together during this time, the male usually blocks the entrance. Once the eggs have been laid and fertilised, the male fish often has to force the female out of the cave before he begins his parental guarding duties. The female plays no further part in brood care, but the male will be seen fanning the eggs with his pectoral fins and blocking the cave entrance from any intruders. Eggs typically number around 20-30 and take 5-7 days to hatch. The fry will feed from their sizeable yolk sacs for the first few days, and after this has been consumed, they will require very regular feedings of baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii), microworms, and various small or crushed dried sinking foods. It is important that food is available to the fry at all times as they can all too easily starve, but keep a very close eye on water quality when feeding constantly, and perform lots of very regular but very small partial changes to keep nitrogenous waste levels as low as possible. The adults pose no threat to the fry, but other fish sharing the same tank might do.

Here, these laterally compressed fish glide effortlessly between cracks and crevices in their ongoing search for shrimps, other small crustaceans, and fish fry. The aquarium that houses this species should be at least 5ft long, with a good amount of filtration, water movement and oxygenation. The best choice of substrate would be coral sand or aragonite, which will help to keep the water hard and alkaline. Rocks should be used to create small outcrops and plenty of caves, ensuring that there are ample visual barriers. Despite their slightly menacing appearance, Compressiceps Cichlids are usually only mildly aggressive towards one another in the confines of the home aquarium, and broken lines of sight amongst the decor will help if any problems do arise. These cichlids can be maintained in a species-only aquarium or as part of a Tanganyikan community with fish of similar size and temperament. Due to the capacious mouth and predatory nature, they are not to be housed with small fish, such as shelldwellers. If a breeding pair forms within the group, they can become much more territorially aggressive than usual, and it is often best to move them to a tank of their own at this stage. Compressiceps Cichlids are intolerant of poor water conditions, so ensure small partial water changes are carried out on a frequent basis. Several geographic colour variations are available, including 'Black Pearl', 'Gold Head', 'Chaitika Orange', 'Kalambo', 'Kigoma Red', 'Mutondwe Fire Fin', and 'Nangu Black'.",

She will then deposit eggs onto the substrate inside the cave, whilst the male releases his milt at the entrance. Both fish will then fan the water with their pectoral fins, in order to direct the milt over the eggs, which may number as many as 200. The female fish guards the eggs inside the cave, whilst the male guards the general perimeter around it. The eggs should hatch within 48-72 hours (temperature dependent) and will become free-swimming some 6-9 days later. At this point, the young can be offered baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii). It may be prudent to move the male to other quarters before the fry become free-swimming, as he may predate on them.

This elongate, dwarf cichlid must be provided with specialised conditions if it is to thrive in the home aquarium; indeed, a requisite for their care is highly oxygenated, warm water with plenty of current, and tight fitting coverslides are a must. These fish are strong swimmers and are somewhat aggressive, so require a large aquarium compared to their adult size. Provide a soft sandy substrate along with plenty of nooks and crannies formed from piles of pebbles, rocks, pieces of smooth slate, and tangles of driftwood - ensuring that there are some broken lines of sight for the fish to set up territories. Plants are not found in any great abundance in the fast-flowing waters of the natural habitat of W. compressiceps, so are not considered essential; however, robust species such as Anubias and Microsorum tied onto driftwood will help with water quality and will make the aquarium look more aesthetically pleasing, as well as creating more hiding places. Plants grown in the substrate will be uprooted. The best way to keep these cichlids is either as a known compatible pair, or in dense groups (10+) in more spacious aquaria. Groups that are too small could result in major territorial bickering and subsequent losses. A larger group (housed in a tank with a multitude of visual barriers) will ensure that no one fish bears the brunt of any squabbles and is subjected to constant stress - any arguments will be spread throughout the group. These cichlids will be at their best in a species-only aquarium, but can be kept with other robust, current-loving fish that are of similar size (anything smaller will be regarded as food). Like other species that inhabit fresh running waters, these cichlids will not tolerate a build-up of nitrates within the aquarium and require excellent water conditions at all times if they are to thrive - so powerful filtration and regular partial water changes are essential.

The home aquarium should be mature, with a dark substrate and background and with plenty of plant cover - both rooted and floating - in order for these peaceful mid-to-top-dwelling fish to feel secure. Filtration should be efficient but water movement gentle. These fish are best maintained in groups of at least 10, and more than this wherever possible. Dominant males may occasionally bicker with one other (more so than is typically seen in other Nannostomus species), but providing the tank is spacious and there is a good network of hiding places/visual barriers for them to retreat into if necessary, no harm should ensue. Keeping more females than males will also help to reduce any minor aggression-related problems. In the wild, these fish are found alongside many other small characins, including representatives from the Copella, Crenuchus, Hemigrammus, and Pyrrhulina genera, along with the congener Nannostomus eques (the Hockeystick Pencilfish). Dwarf cichlids from the Apistogramma and Mikrogeophagus genera could also be considered as good tankmates, as well as Corydoras catfish and small loricariids. Choose companions wisely as Coral Red Pencilfish can be fairly timid and will hide away and refuse to feed if tankmates are too boisterous. If unfussy about creating an exact biotope, some of the smaller Rasbora and Boraras species from Asia would get along well with the pencilfish, as would Kuhli loaches (Pangio spp.). As with other Nannostomus species, N. mortenthaleri assume a cryptic colour overnight so may look a little pale when the lights first switch on.

Other peaceful species such as some of the smaller pencilfish, tetra, and rasboras make ideal tankmates, and their presence as dither fish in midwater will encourage the Corydoras out into view more often.\nIt's no surprise that this species is easily confused with the less robust and round-nosed Hoplisoma sp. CW107. Luckily most batches are unlikely to contain both species. Recent work on the previously enormous genus Corydoras has moved this species into Brochis, reflecting a close kinship despite some differences such as numbers of dorsal fin rays and a lack of senior synonyms used for the other groups/lineages of former Corydoras species. Further studies will probably result in this fish being placed in a new genus.",

        "breeding": "Some Corydoras can be challenging to breed and are often prompted by cues that are absent in the average set up. Mature pairs may be triggered into spawning by performing a large, slightly cooler water change. The pair will adopt the classic \u2018T position\u2019 where the male fertilises the eggs that are held between the female\u2019s pelvic fins. The adhesive eggs will then be deposited onto plants, d\u00e9cor, or the sides of the aquarium etc and the process repeated. The eggs generally take 4-5 days to hatch after which time the tiny fry should be offered finely powdered first foods. A few days later they will be able to take newly hatched brineshrimp. To avoid predation and ensure a higher success rate, many fishkeepers move the parents to another aquarium after the eggs have all been deposited.",

Although plants are not found in abundance in the natural waters of this species, a moderate amount of planting will be appreciated and will help to make the fish feel more secure. Lighting should not be too bright (tannins and floating plants can help to diffuse brighter lighting), and darker substrate and background choices will help to show off their beautiful colours. Costello tetras should always be maintained in good sized groups, 6 would be the minimum recommended, 10+ would be better. Not only will the fish feel more secure, but this will result in a far more effective, natural-looking shoal. Tankmates should also be small and peaceful, as these fish are easily intimidated by larger or more rowdy species. Ideal tankmates would include Corydoras catfish, small dwarf cichlids such as Apistogramma or Mikrogeophagus, and some of the smaller Loricariidae (suckermouth catfish).

However if you wish to raise a good number of fry, a small separate breeding aquarium should be set up for the purpose. This tank should also contain soft, acidic water, and the temperature should be set towards the high end of their preferred range. Prior to the spawning attempt, condition your fish on plenty of small meaty live or frozen foods. Clumps of Java moss or a few bunches of fine-leaved plants should be added to the breeding tank to give the fish somewhere to scatter their eggs, and very gentle filtration should be provided via an air-driven sponge filter. No dedicated lighting should be used, as eggs and fry tend to be light sensitive. Acclimatise a mix of both sexes across to the new tank very carefully during the evening, and in the morning, when sunlight hits the tank, spawning should commence. The parents should be removed immediately after spawning ceases as they will predate on the eggs. Some aquarists like to use a fine mesh in the tank so that the scattered eggs can fall to safety, away from the attention of the adult fish. The eggs should hatch within 24-36 (temperature dependent) and the fry should become free swimming 72-96 hours later. Ideally try and keep the tank in darkness once eggs have been scattered, to protect them and the resultant sensitive young fry from being damaged by bright light. The young will initially feed from their yolk sacs, and infusoria should be the first food offered, followed by baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and microworm as they grow.",

It seems likely that these founding fish were one of a number of species native to the warm, oxygen rich flowing waters of the Rio Xingu and it's quite possible that the Cracked zebra is a hybrid.\nThe aquarium should be mature, with a soft sand substrate and various pieces of smooth rockwork and driftwood arranged to create lots of small nooks and crannies. There should be brisk water movement and a high level of oxygenation, perhaps provided by a river-tank manifold or powerheads (in addition to the current generated by the filtration). As plants are not found in any great abundance in the natural habitat, they can be omitted from the aquascape, although a few areas of hardy vegetation (that can cope with current) will make the aquarium look more aesthetically pleasing and will help with water quality. Ample hiding places/visual barriers amongst the decor will enable you to keep a group of these fish together and will obviously further your chances of breeding them. Male Hypancistrus are fairly territorial and care should be taken to provide plenty of caves. Tankmates must be small and peaceful, and able to thrive in warm, fast-flowing water. As these fish do not compete well for food, avoid keeping with fish that are boisterous at feeding times. These plecs are largely carnivorous and will not make any impact on algae. Ensure that regular partial water changes are carried out as these catfish will not tolerate an elevated nitrate level.\nHas been bred into a few lines, including the Super white form which is one of the most popular.

        "breeding": "This species has been bred in the home aquarium for a number of generations and makes for a very worthwhile breeding project. The temperature of the water should be raised to 28 \u00b0C and it must be extremely well-filtered and highly oxygenated. Provide a selection of small caves which have an entrance only marginally bigger than the fish. These can either be formed from arranging the rockwork in such a way that small, secluded crevices are created, or pre-constructed from small pieces of slate siliconed together. It is crucial that these caves are situated in an area with decent water movement. When in spawning condition, males will choose a preferred cave and defend it from any other males present, whilst at the same time, will try to entice a ripe female inside. Spawning does not always take place straight away; indeed, it can be some days before the female is ready to deposit her eggs, but the fish will remain inside the cave together during this time, the male usually blocks the entrance. Once the eggs have been laid and fertilised, the male fish often has to force the female out of the cave before he begins his parental guarding duties. The female plays no further part in brood care, but the male will be seen fanning the eggs with his pectoral fins and blocking the cave entrance from any intruders. Eggs typically number around 45 and take around a week to hatch. The fry will feed from their sizeable yolk sacs for the first few days, and after this has been consumed, they will require very regular feedings of baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii), microworms, and various small or crushed dried sinking foods. It is important that food is available to the fry at all times as they can all too easily starve but keep a very close eye on water quality when feeding constantly and perform lots of very regular but very small partial changes to keep nitrogenous waste levels as low as possible. The adults pose no threat to the fry, but other fish sharing the same tank might do. This is why many aquarists like to keep these catfish in a species-only set up, to further their chances of raising the maximum number of young.",

Dried Indian Almond leaves (Catappa terminalia) could be scattered on the substrate for a natural effect - these will also aid in sustaining the required water conditions, but will require periodic replacement. Filtration and water movement should be very gentle, and small partial water changes will help to keep nitrate to a minimum.

The substrate is comprised of sand, smooth gravel, and water-worn rocks and boulders. Aquatic plants do not usually feature in these habitats, although in some areas there may be a little marginal vegetation and a forest canopy overhead. These brightly-coloured torpedo shaped loaches are members of a group of bottom dwellers referred to as Brook Loaches, and they occupy a similar, but not quite so harsh niche to that of the balitorids (Hillstream Loaches). Nemacheilidae is a huge and diverse family, currently containing over 450 species and is comprised of many popular genera, including Aborichthys, Acanthocobitis, Mesonoemacheilus, Nemacheilus, Schistura, and Yunnanilus. A requisite for their care is highly oxygenated water with plenty of current, and tight fitting coverslides are a must. The Crimson Loach is one of the most strikingly coloured members of the vast Schistura genus, but is highly territorial and must be kept in spacious aquaria with plenty of \"visual barriers\" amongst the decor. Their antagonistic behaviour is not so much of an issue in the wild, where fish can easily move from one territory to another, but it can certainly present problems within the confines of the aquarium. Provide a sandy substrate along with plenty of nooks and crannies formed from pebbles, rocks, pieces of slate, and tangles of driftwood - ensuring that lines of sight are broken up. As mentioned above, plants are not found in any great abundance in the fast-flowing waters of the natural habitat of the Crimson Loach, so are not considered essential; however, robust species such as Anubias and Microsorum tied onto driftwood will help with water quality and will make the aquarium look more aesthetically pleasing, as well as creating more hiding places. The best way to keep these loaches is either singly, as a known compatible pair, or in dense groups (10+). Keeping just 3 or 4 can result in carnage with specimens being lost. Crimson Loaches do not usually show aggression towards other current-loving fish, providing that they are not other nemacheilids. Nonetheless, small placid tankmates are best avoided, as are species with long fins. Good companions could include some of the smaller Barbs, Barilius/Opsarius, temperate Bitterlings, Crossocheilus, Danios, Devarios, or Garras, and shoals of these will act as 'dither fish', encouraging the loaches out into the open. Like other species that inhabit fresh running waters, these loaches will not tolerate a build-up of nitrates within the aquarium and require excellent water conditions at all times if they are to thrive - so powerful filtration and regular partial water changes are essential.

Although they may not be to the taste of purists, this is an attractive fish that has been bred in the Far East for some time and is usually readily available in the trade. It is a small-medium sized, peaceful rainbowfish that is ideally suited to planted community aquaria. The tank should be as spacious as possible, as these are fairly active fish, and they should be maintained in groups of 6 or more due to their shoaling nature. The juveniles of many rainbowfish can often look a little drab compared to the adults, and as such are sometimes overlooked in the shops. However, once settled into the security of the planted aquarium, these young specimens will begin to colour up, gradually revealing their stunning adult beauty. Crossing Rainbowfish will not bother smaller tankmates, as their mouth/throat is too narrow to be able to swallow them.",

Here the water has a moderate current, and flows over sandy substrates interspersed with rocks, but has little in the way of aquatic vegetation. These sedentary, elongate bottom-dwellers are best kept in a spacious, mature aquarium. Provide a large expanse of soft sand substrate (gravel must be avoided) with a number of shady hiding places amongst driftwood and rocky caves. As these fish prefer dim lighting, open expanses of sand in brightly lit tanks should be shaded with large, broad-leaved plants such as Anubias tied to the decor (rooted plants will be dug up) or floating plant species. These fish will usually remain partially buried during daylight hours, and the addition of dried leaf litter would further help to emulate the natural environment. Blue moon lighting (which switches on just before the main lights go out) will allow you to spend time observing these fish under their preferred subdued illumination. Crying Whiptails are peaceful towards their own kind and should be kept in groups. Tankmates should be of similar size and temperament, and ideally occupy the mid to upper levels. The presence of such fish swimming around in open water may even encourage these reclusive catfish out into view a bit more. Observe carefully to ensure that none of the other fish are continually nipping away at the inactive, partially buried catfish. Good filtration along with frequent partial water changes are essential for keeping nitrogenous wastes to a minimum; however, the actual water flow within the aquarium should not be excessive. Although this fish remains undescribed at present, the ''Crying'' common name was coined in reference to the two distinctive dark parallel lines that run through the eyes, from the snout to just before the dorsal fin.",
        "feeding": "Offer a variety of small, meaty frozen foods such as bloodworm, white mosquito larvae, black mosquito larvae, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, daphnia etc. as well as different sinking catfish pellets/granules.

        "care": "The beautiful and popular Crystal Red Shrimp is an aquarium cultivated red form of the bee shrimp Caridina cantonensis. These shrimp are highly social creatures that are best maintained in large colonies. They are suitable for mature aquariums containing communities of small, peaceful fish only, as larger tankmates will regard them as a snack. Crystal Red Shrimp are excellent algae eaters and will browse on many different algae types. Highly recommended for planted aquaria, they will not damage the plants, instead they will feed on any dead leaves - and large groups will also be beneficial in keeping the leaves of slower-growing species free from nuisance algae. Tall plants seem to be particularly favoured, and these shrimp can often be seen climbing and 'hanging around' in plant cover near to the water's surface. Like most species of shrimp, an elevated nitrate level will not be tolerated - ensure high standards of water quality are maintained at all times, ideally with small partial water changes performed a few times per week. Filtration should be efficient but gentle; always try to aim the output of the filter towards the surface of the water to ensure that there is a sufficient level of oxygenation (something that can be all too easily overlooked in gently filtered shrimp aquaria). Crystal Red Shrimps will moult regularly whilst growing, and the sudden appearance of perfectly formed shrimp casings on the floor of the aquarium can cause alarm to fishkeepers who have not seen this before. The shrimps can sometimes be seen feeding on the casings - this is actually very nutritious for them, so do not rush to siphon them from the substrate. Once the shrimp has moulted, it will remain hidden for a time until the new shell hardens and it has a bit more protection. Be aware that these shrimp do not tend to fare well in water that is over 26 \u00b0C (79 deg F), and for greatest long term health, hard, alkaline conditions are best avoided. A grading system has evolved over time to separate Crystal Red Shrimps with different intensities of colour and size/number of white patches - the higher grades commanding quite astonishing price tags from some breeders. Acclimatise these shrimps very carefully and slowly, either by drip acclimatisation or using a Maidenhead Aquatics Fintro. Crystal Red Shrimps are considered somewhat delicate and so they are not recommended for beginners. Be extremely careful if using CO2 injection on planted aquaria containing these shrimps, as they will not cope with swings in pH. Many aquarists are tempted to mix Crystal Red Shrimps with Cherry Shrimps in the same aquarium, but this is not advised as their temperature requirements are rather different. Although you will always hear of cases where Crystal Red Shrimps have been kept in water with a higher pH or temperature, lifespan, overall health and breeding will be severely diminished under such conditions. May also be seen on sale as Red Crystal Bee Shrimp.",
        "feeding": "Will browse on algae and biofilm. Supplement the diet with algae wafers, sinking pellets, crushed flake foods, small frozen foods such as daphnia, baby brineshrimp, mini-bloodworm etc., and also offer some vegetable matter such as blanched spinach or courgette. It can be beneficial to add some dried Indian almond leaves (Terminalia catappa) to the aquarium as biofilm will form on these as they slowly rot, and this provides a great source of food for the shrimps, whilst helping to maintain a low pH in the aquarium.",
        "breeding": "Crystal Red Shrimps often breed freely in the home aquarium given optimal conditions. Best results occur when the water is slightly soft and acidic, and when temperature is maintained between 21-23 \u00b0C (70-73 deg F). Females may still carry eggs at the higher end of the preferred temperature range, but smaller numbers of young are produced compared to shrimps living in cooler waters. Colours also tend to be more vibrant at lower temperatures. The eggs are held underneath the female until hatching takes place (approx. 1 month), and will be visible within the abdomen. Unlike some species, the young do not go through a larval stage and, are instead, born as miniature replicas of the adult shrimp. On hatching, the offspring will be coloured red and white just like their parents, however, actual grading cannot be performed until they develop further with age, when the quality of features will be easier to determine. Many aquarists like to cover the intakes of power filters with fine sponges to prevent the tiny youngsters from being drawn in.",

        "care": "The Cuckoo Catfish is common throughout Lake Tanganyika, where it inhabits the littoral and benthic zones to a depth of 100m (328ft).\nTheir aquarium should be spacious with a soft sandy substrate in order to protect the sensory barbels. It should be decorated with a good amount of rocky caves/PVC tubes, some driftwood, and robust planting (that can cope with hard, alkaline conditions) to provide shady areas, but you should also ensure that a roomy swimming space is left along the front of the tank. Efficient filtration is recommended, as these fish are voracious eaters and can produce a fair amount of waste. The water should be well-oxygenated with a moderate current, and frequent partial water changes are a must to help keep nitrate to a minimum. These fish are most comfortable in aquaria with subdued lighting, and the use of blue-moon type illumination is highly recommended so that you may observe a few hours of the nightly goings-on in an aquarium containing these catfish. Ensure that heaters are covered with heater guards to prevent these catfish from being burned when looking for dark crevices to rest against. A gregarious species, S. multipunctatus should be kept in groups for their continued wellbeing. Companions should be relatively peaceful although these fish will use their pectoral spines to thwart attackers. They do well as part of a Tanganyikan community of medium-large sized fish but will also thrive and breed alongside mouthbrooders from Malawi or Victoria, which serve as great hosts for their eggs. Young 'multis' are surprisingly deep-bodied and very stocky, before growing into a more graceful adult body shape.\nConsidering how easily these fish will breed when kept in the right company, it's rather a shame to see that they're widely used to produce hybrids through artificial spawning. These hybrids share some features of both parents but with the commercial bonus of much larger brood sizes from a non-rift female fish. As these mass-spawned youngsters are cheaper to produce, they are occasionally exported as multipunctatus and it can be tricky to tell them apart. Price is often the best guide and thanks to their small broods of large eggs, real Cuckoo cats are never cheap.",

These are greedy fish and are easy to feed on a quality sinking staple diet.",
        "breeding": "Unlike the majority of Synodontis species, S. multipunctatus is routinely bred in the home aquarium. Interestingly, it has two reported methods of breeding: brood parasitism and egg scattering. For the former, which is much more common, the catfish coincides its spawning with that of a mouthbrooding cichlid (the catfish will come racing out of their caves the moment they become aware of the cichlids spawning) and stealthily lay eggs amongst those of the host fish. As the Synodontis eggs hatch more quickly than the cichlid eggs, the young catfish consume all the cichlid eggs, leaving the unsuspecting adult cichlid to guard the catfish fry as if they were its own. In the aquarium, well-conditioned S. multipunctatus are most likely to breed in the company of Malawian Haps or Peacocks - brood parasitism taking place if suitable host cichlids are present with tiny Synos being a surprise sighting as they bumble around the shelter of rocks. During egg scattering, the spawning clinch follows a period of excited chasing from the male fish. Eggs are deposited on the substrate or in a cave, often in the care of (uncooperative!) territorial cichlids which then guard the area.",

        "care": "The Cururu Stingray is a case of mistaken identity, having been referred to as P. hystrix for years. The real P. hystrix is known from Argentina and it's thought that this fish has never been present in the trade. By contrast, this 'Rio Negro hystrix' turns out to be the smallest species of ray available in the hobby. This beautiful bottom-dweller still grows quite large and requires a voluminous aquarium with powerful filtration to match. The length and width of the tank is generally much more important than the height, giving this fish as much floor space as possible and allowing for the fish to turn freely with the long tail. The aquarium must be biologically mature before adding this species. A soft sand substrate is essential, as stingrays spend the majority of their time on the bottom and like to bury themselves in the substrate from time to time (with just the eyes protruding), as well as searching out food items on the sand. When resting on or in the substrate, small openings located on the top of the head (known as spiracles) draw water into the gill chambers to facilitate oxygen exchange. Decor is not overly necessary for stingrays, as a large expanse of sand is much more important for their continued wellbeing. Some tangles of driftwood and smooth rocks could be incorporated, but these must be very secure, and not take up very much of the floor space. The Cururu Stingray is a voracious eater that produces a lot of waste, and requires continuous excellent water conditions. To this end, filtration must be powerful and the water well-oxygenated. A frequent partial water change regime is absolutely essential as this fish will not tolerate an elevated nitrate level. Several huge canister filters can be employed, but sump filtration may be more prudent as then equipment such as heaters can be kept in the sump and out of the main tank where they would be very easily damaged. Lighting should be fairly dim, as these fish do not enjoy bright illumination. Stingrays are not particularly sociable and are best maintained either singly, as a male/female pair, or one male with a group of females. Male fish can be rather rough with one another, so it's best to house only one male per tank. Tankmates (if desired) must be chosen very carefully, as stingrays are highly proficient predators; however, despite this, they will fail to thrive if housed with boisterous or territorial species. The best companions would be large, passive midwater or surface-dwelling fish. Avoid keeping with Loricariids (suckermouth catfish) as within the confines of the home aquarium, there are many documented instances of them attaching themselves and rasping away at the flat, disc-shaped body of stingrays, causing injury. Ensure the tank has tight fitting coverslides that are weighted down, as these fish are expert jumpers. Take extra care when offering food, as it is not unusual for the stingray to swim up and breach the water's surface during all the excitement of a feeding frenzy. Like all species from this genus, P. wallacei is equipped with one or more barbed spines that are found on the dorsal surface of the middle section of the tail. These spines are coated with an extremely toxic mucus that inflicts very painful wounds, and tends to be employed in defence or when the fish is alarmed. Always handle stingrays with much care. When these fish need to be moved, they should always be herded into a solid container, rather than using a net. If you are stung by a Potamotrygon spp. stingray, seek immediate medical help for pain relief and to ensure no part of the stinger remains in the wound (this could lead to a serious secondary infection). These fish shed their stingers every 2-3 months and new ones grow in their place. Be aware that discarded stingers can remain venomous for some time, so exercise caution when carrying out tank maintenance. This fish is long-lived (20+ years) and a fascinating species to look after, but it is quite the commitment so do ensure that all of its specific care requirements can be met before purchase. May also be seen on sale as the Porcupine Stingray.",
        "feeding": "Juveniles can be offered bloodworm, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, Mysis shrimp, and chopped krill. Adults should be offered larger foodstuffs such as cockles, mussels, prawns, river shrimp, silversides, whitebait, and pieces of white fish flesh. Stingrays have a fast metabolism and require feeding 2-3 times per day (which is why powerful filtration and a strict water change regime is absolutely essential).",
        "breeding": "The Cururu Stingray has been bred in the home aquarium, and like other Potamotrygon spp. reproduces via a breeding strategy known as matrotrophic viviparity. Stingrays take many years to become sexually mature, so patience may be required, particularly if starting out with fairly young fish. As the courtship ritual can be a somewhat violent affair, it is essential that the female is larger than the male so that she can defend herself adequately from the male's advances, which includes incessant chasing and rough biting. Always observe carefully just in case the female is not receptive, as the fish may need separating for safety reasons. When ready to spawn, the pair briefly go belly-to-belly, with the male inserting one of his claspers into the female's cloaca, fertilisation taking place internally. Gestation usually lasts 2-3 months, and a typical sized litter would number between 1 and 8 (the young often referred to as 'pups'). The pups develop inside the mother, nourished by secretions from her villi (umbilical filaments), and when they are born, they are fully-formed miniatures of the adults. It is essential that the female receives good, nutritious feedings during the gestation period as she will expend a lot of energy when carrying and nourishing her pups. Once the pups are born, it may be best to move them carefully to other quarters, as although predation is rare, it is not unheard of. There is also the matter of the water becoming very clouded during the birth when bodily fluids are released, so the main tank will require a large water change (which the pups might be sensitive to). The pups will feed from their yolk sacs for the first week or so, after which time they can be offered a variety of small meaty frozen foods. A compatible pair of stingrays may attempt to breed regularly, and as this can be rather hard on the female, it may be best to separate the pair after every couple of litters, in order for her to recover properly and have a rest from such an energy-intensive process.",

It is therefore prudent to carry out frequent partial water changes rather than large, infrequent changes. This species is not recommended for beginners. The Dadio naturally occurs in two distinct colour morphs. One sports a distinct solid blue horizontal line, whereas the other shows a series of dots along this line.

        "care": "The Daffodil Cichlid is widely distributed throughout the southern half of Lake Tanganyika, where it favours shallow, sediment-rich rocky habitats. Here, these elegant fish form large shoals (hundreds of fish) which forage for food together, although when of breeding age, they form monogamous pairs. The aquarium that houses this species should be at least 4ft long, with a good amount of filtration, water movement and oxygenation. The best choice of substrate would be coral sand or aragonite, which will help to keep the water hard and alkaline. Rocks should be used to create small outcrops and plenty of caves, ensuring that there are ample visual barriers. Daffodil Cichlids can be moderately aggressive towards one another in the confines of the home aquarium, so broken lines of sight amongst the decor will help. These cichlids can be maintained in a species-only aquarium or as part of a Tanganyikan community with fish of similar size and temperament. However, if a breeding pair forms within the group, they can become much more territorially aggressive, and it is often best to move them to a tank of their own at this stage. Combining Daffodil Cichlids with other species does not always work in the long run, as their breeding strategy of producing large numbers with generations of juveniles defending their burgeoning family and ever-growing home territory, will eventually leave no room for outsiders. Daffodil Cichlids are intolerant of poor water conditions, so ensure small partial water changes are carried out on a frequent basis.",

        "breeding": "Neolamprologus pulcher is a cave spawning species. The bond these fish form when breeding is strong and is retained during brood care and subsequent spawns. In the wild, spawning occurs in the females' preferred cave. The same process frequently occurs in the home aquarium, with the ripe female leading the chosen male from his territory to her cave. Other times, the pair may be seen excavating a cave from scratch. The female then deposits her eggs (averaging around 100) on the sides of the cave, the male immediately swimming over them and fertilising with his sperm. It is not always obvious when these fish have spawned, as oftentimes they are very secretive and the cave may be hidden from view. Once spawning has finished, the female will tend to the eggs, with the male fish guarding the perimeter of the cave. The eggs should hatch within 3-4 days (temperature dependent), with the fry becoming free swimming some 7-10 days later. The young can be started off on a diet of freshly hatched brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and finely powdered \"first foods\". Brood care is fairly prolonged, and the immature offspring may then help in guarding the subsequent generation of fry, coexisting within the same aquarium and forming a nuclear family. The cycle continues as the adults spawn again, and it is possible to have several generations living together.",

The brilliant red and iridescent blue colouration is quite remarkable for a ricefish, most known species being largely translucent silver. Even the females have a good deal of colour. When this species was discovered, it was found to be shoaling with a Nomorhamphus sp. halfbeak. Interestingly, at around the same time as the first exports of O. woworae began, another similar looking ricefish species was collected from Kendari on mainland Sulawesi, and has been traded under various names including Oryzias sp. \"kendari\", O. sp. \"neon\" and O. sp. \"sulawesi\". There are noticeable differences in the fish from Kendari, which distinguishes it from the true O. woworae, including much less red colouration on the lower jaw and a greater degree of blue along the flanks. It is advisable not to keep the two forms together in the aquarium for fear of hybridisation. In the wild, this species inhabits a slow-moving freshwater stream and some associated still ponds under fairly dense forest cover. The substrate is said to consist of mud and sand, with areas of leaf litter. The aquarium should be mature and well-filtered, with plenty of dark shady areas amongst aquatic vegetation and decor such as the spindly Sumatra wood presently available in many aquatic shops. As these fish are found shoaling in large groups in their natural habitat, it is appropriate to keep them in good numbers (6+ is recommended) in the home aquarium. Daisy's Blue Ricefish seem to be of a peaceful disposition and should only be kept with other fish of a similar size, temperament, and which also enjoy the same aquarium conditions.

It belongs to the Mbuna group of cichlids, but as yet remains undescribed. The aquarium should be at least 4ft long and aquascaped to emulate a rocky reef effect with some open expanses of sand. D\u00c3\u00a9cor such as ocean rock can be used to build sturdy structures which stretch from the base of the tank to near the surface of the water. These structures should be built with the purpose of creating many crevices for the fish to explore but constructed in such a way so as to keep the rocks stable if the fish start to dig around and underneath them. Although a substrate of coral sand or Aragonite is often recommended to help to keep the water hard and alkaline, Mbuna feel safer and show better colours over a darker substrate. The Aragonite or coral sand can always be placed into a mesh bag and kept inside the external filter for buffering purposes. Most rock-dwelling species are extremely aggressive and need to be kept under conditions of 'controlled-overcrowding' to prevent territorial disputes ending fatally - additional filtration may also be required to cope with a heavy bioload. The Daktari cichlid is a fairly belligerent species, and it is best to keep one male in a harem situation with several females (keeping just one female with a male will result in continual harassment and possibly death). This species can be kept successfully alongside other outgoing Mbuna, although it is best to avoid fish with a similar colour pattern. Interestingly, most mature males are bright yellow, but the population furthest south is particularly eye-catching as the males have a sky blue sheen overlaying the yellow colour. May also be seen on sale as Doctor's Mbuna.",

Vegetable matter such as cucumber, blanched spinach and romaine lettuce can be fed on a regular basis.",
        "breeding": "When ready to spawn, the colouration of the male will intensify and his aggression level will heighten. He will choose and clean a spawning site, then display to the female fish until one accepts him. They will circle each other in a head to tail manner a number of times, until the female deposits her eggs. These are deposited just one or two at a time and after doing so, she immediately turns around and picks them up. At the same time, the male will rotate so that he is almost on his side, at the same time shaking and extending his anal fin, releasing his milt. The female sees the egg spots on the male\"\u2122s anal fin and attempts to pick up those \"\u0153eggs\"\u009d whilst she is picking up the real ones that she deposited, and at the same time taking in milt.

This goodeid species lives in quiet, cool, shallow waters over silty or muddy substrates with algae-covered rocks and an abundance of plants such as Lemna (duckweed), Nasturtium (watercress), Potamogeton, and Salvinia (floating fern). The aquarium should be mature and well-filtered, with plenty of shady areas provided amongst aquatic vegetation and d\u00c3\u00a9cor such as spindly driftwood pieces and rocky caves. This is a fairly peaceful species that is best kept in a species tank environment, with 2 or more females to every male; this will reduce the amount of attention that any one female receives from the amorous males and will also further your chances of raising more fry. A shoal of at least 6-8 fish is preferable in a good sized tank, and although there may be a bit of minor chasing between rival males, they are rarely aggressive towards one another and generally do not cause damage. Tankmates are possible, but do ensure these are short-finned, fast-swimming, and are happy in the same cool conditions - although be aware that in such a community setting, the Dark-edged Splitfin fry may be at risk from predation. Be sure to keep the temperature cool as these fish do not fare well above 22 \u00b0C (72 deg F); a means of chilling the water may be necessary during the warmer summer months. Interestingly, the males of this species are capable of displaying a dark spot in the same area that you would expect to see a gravid spot on the females. A study found that it was largely sub-dominant males that displayed this marking, and it is thought they may use this to blend in and gain access to protected groups of females in order to reproduce. Unfortunately, the Dark-edged Splitfin is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN redlist for endangered species - as sadly it has disappeared from many of its known historic sites over the last century, and remaining populations are often  small and isolated. The future of this species is decidedly uncertain. The fish pictured here were commercially bred in the Czech Republic. May also be seen on sale as Golden Sailfin Goodeid.",

The adults are not usually a threat to the young, which may be as large as 8mm SL when born; however, do observe them carefully. A heavily planted aquarium will usually provide enough hiding places and negate the need for separation of adults and young.

Crenuchidae is further split into two sub-families, Crenuchinae and Characidiinae, together comprising 93 species across 12 genera, with many more species currently undescribed. The genus Characidium (sub-family Characidiinae) is the most speciose, with some 64 species, mostly from coastal South America. These fishes are small, usually around 7.5cm (3\"), and live on the bottom in fast-flowing, highly-oxygenated freshwaters, often in the vicinity of rapids and waterfalls. The elongate body shape and position of the fins are an adaptation for living in torrential waters and allow them to forage about on the substrate whilst maintaining position in the current. Darter Tetras are notoriously hard to identify to species level and most imports are labelled incorrectly. However, they do all share similar specialist care requirements, which we will detail here. A requisite for their long-term wellbeing is highly oxygenated, relatively cool water with plenty of current. Provide a sandy substrate along with plenty of nooks and crannies formed from pebbles, smooth rocks, pieces of slate, and tangles of driftwood - ensuring that there are a few visual barriers and some calmer resting areas out of the main flow. Although plants are not found in any great abundance in the fast-flowing waters of the natural habitat (so are not considered essential), robust species such as Anubias and Microsorum tied onto driftwood will help with water quality and will make the aquarium look more aesthetically pleasing, as well as creating more hiding places. Like other species that inhabit fresh running waters, these tetras will not tolerate a build-up of nitrates within the aquarium and require excellent water conditions at all times if they are to thrive - so powerful filtration and regular partial water changes are crucial. Additional water movement could be provided by extra powerheads, and a decent sized air pump is always a handy backup in warmer weather. The best way to keep these gregarious fish is in dense groups of at least 12, and many more where space allows. They may have minor squabbles amongst themselves from time to time, but no real harm should ensue, particularly if there are lots of hiding places available. Larger groups will certainly help to reduce any arguments, as then no single fish will bear the brunt of any antagonistic behaviour, with it instead being spread throughout the shoal. Darter Tetras are perfectly peaceful towards other fish, and good companions could include species which enjoy similar environmental conditions, such as some of the smaller Barbs, brook loaches, Crossocheilus, Danios, Devarios, Garras, hillstream loaches, other small, temperate characins, and small subtropical loricariids (suckermouth catfish). Ensure that the aquarium has tight fitting coverslides with no gaps where equipment feeds into the tank, as these fish are expert jumpers, and many species can actively climb up the glass with ease.

        "breeding": "Darter Tetras have been bred in the home aquarium. A separate breeding tank should be set up with soft acidic water and plenty of thick clumps of fine leaved plants such as Java Moss. There should be good water movement, but ensure that the filter inlet is protected with sponge to prevent eggs/fry from being drawn in. A well conditioned pair should then be carefully acclimatised across. Spawning may be triggered by a slightly cooler partial water change, with the fish often spawning first thing the next morning. Once the female is spent of eggs, the pair should be removed from the spawning tank to prevent predation. The eggs (which may number around 150) should hatch within 36-48 hours, and once free-swimming, the fry can be offered infusoria followed by baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) as they grow.",

The water should be well-oxygenated with a moderate current, and frequent partial water changes are a must to help keep nitrate to a minimum. These fish are most comfortable in aquaria with subdued lighting, and the use of blue-moon type illumination is highly recommended so that you may observe a few hours of the nightly goings-on in an aquarium containing these catfish. A gregarious species, S. decorus should be kept in groups of 5 or more for their continued wellbeing. Ensure that heaters are covered with heater guards to prevent these catfish from being burned when looking for dark crevices to rest against. Companions should be peaceful and larger than 5cm (2\") in length (otherwise they may be predated upon); good tankmates could include medium-large sized barbs and characins, adult rainbowfish, large peaceable cichlids, or Loricariids. Do not house with species renowned for fin-nipping, on account of the showy, lengthy dorsal filament that this catfish develops with age.

        "care": "The Deepwater Hap is known from the eastern side of the lake, at Chiwindi to Mara Point, and from Lumessi to Ntekete. Here, it is found in shallow waters of the sandy habitat, where it feeds on algae and invertebrates stirred up from the substrate by Taeniolethrinops praeorbitalis and other species which like to dig. It was previously believed to have occurred in much deeper waters, hence the common name, which is now a bit of a misnomer but has well and truly stuck. The aquarium should be at least 6ft long and aquascaped with open expanses of sand in addition to a few rocky areas and some thickets of Vallisneria. Decor such as ocean rock can be used to build sturdy structures which stretch from the base of the tank to near the surface of the water. These structures should be built with the purpose of creating many crevices for the fish to explore but constructed in such a way so as to keep the rocks stable if the fish start to dig around and underneath them. Although a substrate of coral sand or Aragonite is often recommended to help to keep the water hard and alkaline, these fish feel safer and show better colours over a darker substrate. The Aragonite or coral sand can always be placed into a mesh bag and kept inside the external filter for buffering purposes. The Deepwater Hap is a relatively peaceful species, and these fish are sometimes observed in large shoals in their natural habitat. In the home aquarium, groups can be maintained together, ideally consisting of one male with a harem of several females. However, if the tank is particularly voluminous, multiple males can be kept together (again with several females allocated to each), but do provide them with an abundance of hiding places/visual barriers so they are able to set up individual territories. Aggression will increase when ready to spawn, so careful observation is required. Suitable tankmates could include relatively peaceful rift lake fish such as other Haps, Aulonocara species, some of the more mild-mannered Mbuna, or Synodontis catfish etc. Several geographical colour variants exist, including 'Blue Otter', 'Gome', 'Londo', 'Mandalawi', and 'Undu'.",

Unfortunately, it can be a little prone to barbel infections/erosion, so it is of paramount importance that the fish are kept on a soft sand substrate (rather than gravel where waste can build up unseen) in order to protect these delicate sensory organs. Regular maintenance, including frequent partial water changes, should be carried out in order to keep these fish in good condition. Provide plenty of shady areas amongst driftwood, rocks, and areas of dense planting. Other peaceful species such as some of the smaller pencilfish, tetra, and rasboras make ideal tankmates, and their presence as \"dither fish\" in midwater will encourage the Corys out into view more often. Corydoras have the ability to breathe air intestinally, so a small gap should be left between the surface of the water and the cover slides in order for the fish to come up to the surface and take air in. It may do this numerous times per day.\nThe specific epithet 'delphax' means 'young pig' or 'piglet', and is in allusion to the fish's eating habits! May also be seen on sale as the False Blochi Catfish. Recent work on the previously enormous genus Corydoras has moved this species into Brochis, reflecting a close kinship despite some differences such as numbers of dorsal fin rays and a lack of senior synonyms used for the other groups/lineages of former Corydoras species.

This species can be kept successfully alongside other robust, outgoing Mbuna, although fish with a similar colour pattern absolutely must be avoided. We recommend that Demasoni cichlids are the last addition to an aquarium, as otherwise they can be exceptionally territorial when introducing new tankmates into what they perceive as their established domain (particularly the dominant male fish) and this can have fatal consequences, even to fish much larger than themselves. This is a beautiful and interesting fish to watch, as it tends to follow the contours of the rocks rather closely, swimming along at unusual angles and even going upside down as it does so.

In order to obtain a compatible pair, it is often best to purchase a group of juveniles and to allow a pair to form naturally, rehoming the remaining fish. The pair will choose a suitable cave as a spawning site, and when ready, the female will deposit her eggs (averaging 30-50) on the sides/roof of the cave, the male immediately swimming over them and fertilising with his sperm. It is not always obvious when these fish have spawned, as oftentimes they are very secretive and the cave may be hidden from view. Once spawning has finished, the female will tend to the eggs, with the male fish guarding the perimeter of the cave. The eggs should hatch within 2-3 days (temperature dependent), with the fry becoming free swimming a few days later. The young can be started off on a diet of freshly hatched brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and finely powdered \"first foods\". Brood care is fairly prolonged, and the immature offspring may then help in guarding the subsequent generation of fry, coexisting within the same aquarium and forming a nuclear family. The cycle continues as the adults spawn again, and it is possible to have several generations living together if the tank is large enough. However, if the aquarium is on the smaller side, and there becomes a shortage of territories, it may be best to rehome the eldest fry once they reach around 2.5cm/1\" in size, for their own safety.",

        "care": "Whilst many myths abound regarding the care of discus in the aquarium (and individual opinions will vary), there are a few tips that are best adhered to for successful maintenance. Firstly, the tank should be large enough to comfortably accommodate these majestic laterally-compressed fish. This means depth should be taken into consideration in addition to length and width. Secondly, the tank should be well-established, with warm, highly-oxygenated, soft & acidic water. It is important that excellent water quality is maintained at all times, so efficient filtration and regular partial water changes are a must. The output from the filter should be moderate (but not overpowering) for these relatively slow swimmers, and lighting should be slightly subdued or else diffused with some floating plant cover. Furnish the tank with plenty of bogwood pieces/twisted roots and plants, but leave a large open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Domestic discus dont always appreciate naturalistic surroundings at first and may be more comfortable in more familiar spartan surroundings. As Discus are very sensitive to the dissolved metals and organics found in many tap water supplies, an RO unit is definitely worth considering. Discus are best maintained in large groups, in order for them to form a natural hierarchy. Add 5 or 6 fish to start with, and assuming all goes well, add another few to the shoal a short while afterwards, choosing fish of similar size. Tankmates must be chosen with care. They should be of a peaceful nature and behave placidly at feeding times, not too small that they may be eaten by any adult Discus in the tank, and preferably diurnal so that they don't worry the discus overnight with boisterous activities. Ideal companions are warmth tolerant Corydoras catfish, Bristlenose (Ancistrus sp.) and peaceful dwarf cichlids such as Rams or Apistogramma sp. It should be mentioned that some European Discus suppliers are now keeping their Discus in conditions closer to neutral, and in some cases even in slightly alkaline conditions. Speak to your local store to find out where their Discus were sourced from and what conditions they are being kept in. You should always avoid mixing Discus from different sources (i.e. Asian vs European) wherever possible. Different colour strains (and there are lots of them!) from the same origin and the same supplier can be mixed without difficulty. At present, taxonomists consider there to be 3 separate species of Discus: Symphysodon aequifasciatus, S. discus, and S. tarzoo with geographical forms and instances of natural hybridisation.",
        "feeding": "Offer a varied diet, fed in small amounts at least 3 times per day e.g. flake, granular foods, and frozen foods such as brineshrimp, beefheart, bloodworm and special \"Discus mixes\". Adding a vitamin supplement to the foods can be beneficial. Try to vary up the food on a regular basis so that the Discus do not become hooked on one type of food only.",
        "breeding": "Soft, acidic water is a prerequisite for successful breeding. Eggs are laid on a pre-cleaned spawning site (usually a spawning cone or upright piece of slate) and are protected by the parents, who will fan them with their pectoral fins to ensure a gentle flow of water over them. The eggs should hatch within approx 72 hours, and after a further 48+ hours, the free-swimming fry will begin to feed on body mucus secreted by the parents (during this time, the adults will turn quite dark in colour). Generally it is best to separate the fry from the parents after 7-10 days to prevent the fry from overgrazing on the parent\"\u2122s skin. At this point they can be offered newly hatched baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii).",

        "care": "The Doctor Fish has a wide area of natural distribution, including the Jordan, Orontes, and Tigris-Euphrates River basins, along with coastal rivers in northern Syria and southern Turkey. Here, it is found in clear, swiftly-flowing, highly-oxygenated waters, with rocky substrates covered in aufwuchs-rich biofilms. The aquarium should be mature, and at least 4ft (120cm) long with vigorous water movement/high O2 level. This species will not thrive in a standard community set-up, so be sure to meet its requirements for highly oxygenated fast-flowing waters - ideally provided by powerful external canister filtration. The Doctor Fish is peaceful towards other fish, but a little territorial with its own kind and similar-looking species. In the wild it has been observed moving around in loose aggregations, so is best maintained in groups of 5 or more in aquaria with plenty of visual barriers amongst the decor. In numbers less than this, they may squabble amongst themselves every so often, so always aim for a good sized group in order that no single fish bears the continual brunt of any aggression. The aquarium should be aquascaped with a soft sand or very fine rounded gravel substrate, and furnished with cobbles, smooth rocks, and bogwood pieces. Lighting can be fairly bright to encourage algae growth, which the fish will enjoy browsing on for the micro-organisms it may contain. Shady areas can be provided with the layout of the rockwork/bogwood, and by growing canopies of hardy plants such as Anubias sp. or Java fern (both tied to the driftwood). Some thought should be given to creating a number of visual barriers within the aquarium at the time of aquascaping, so if any minor territorial disputes do arise, the fish can get away from the other\"\u2122s line of sight. An extremely important point to note is that Garra rufa are capable of climbing up the glass with ease, something they tend to do when newly imported or moved; therefore be absolutely sure the tank has tight fitting coverslides and that there are no small gaps that the fish can crawl out of e.g. where equipment power leads feed into the back of the hood. Bottom dwelling tankmates could include many of the peaceful botiid river loaches, the nemacheilid brook loaches, and the more robust members of the balitorid hillstream loach group. For the upper levels, consider some of the Barilius, Danio, Devario, Opsarius, and smaller members of the Puntius genus (research individual species to ensure compatibility before purchase though, as not every species from these genera will be suitable). Although these fish are relatively peaceable, they can be fairly boisterous at feeding times and are not recommended for housing alongside slow-moving laterally-compressed fish such as discus or angelfish (which do not benefit from the same water conditions anyway). Water quality is of utmost importance for the Doctor Fish - be sure to carry out regular partial water changes to ensure that nitrate levels remain at a minimum. May also be seen on sale as the Doctor Garra or Red Garra. Unfortunately, these fish are exploited in large numbers within modern beauty spas for pedicures, due to a very questionable ability to remove dead skin, with their wellbeing an afterthought. Under such circumstances, they will never thrive and reach their full potential, due to being kept in unsuitable conditions with no natural enrichment. They have to undergo stressful constant movement from holding tanks to treatment tanks, and are kept hungry in order to approach the dead skin on the feet, never receiving a nutritionally balanced diet.",

        "care": "Tropheus duboisi are found amongst the rocky habitat of Lake Tanganyika, grazing in slightly deeper water than their relatives and often in smaller numbers. It's best to keep Tropheus in groups of their own kind and these should be large in number to spread the aggression. Housing 15 or more of these feisty fishes requires a large aquarium and this should be 1.5m or more in length to allow individuals to avoid one another. Small groups inevitably dwindle as harassment and bullying proves too much for the females and weaker males. It is important that the entire group is added at the same time to avoid the aggression which would otherwise be directed towards any newcomers. When adding large numbers of fish in this manner, it's important that the filtration is cycled and capable of handling the waste load. Given the investment involved, the use of a matured filter and bacterial inoculation with products such as Microbe Lift are strongly advised. As always, water quality should be very carefully monitored over the first few weeks. Excellent water quality must be maintained at all times, with partial water changes carried out at least once or twice a week and this may require the addition of buffers to ensure the high pH and carbonate hardness levels required. Strong water movement will ensure high oxygen levels and helps to keep the fish fit and active.\nAlthough Tropheus can be kept in fairly bare aquaria, several separate piles of rocks should be created (instead of a continuous rocky reef) so that individuals can more easily evade one another thanks to broken sight lines. Lighting should be bright to encourage the growth of algae over the decor, which these herbivores will enjoy browsing upon. Sharp rocks (such as lava rock) should not be used as they can cause damage to the mouths of these fishes as they graze.\nAside from a tendency to kill one another best controlled by keeping them in big groups, diet is the other major factor in successful care. These fishes are very prone to bloating caused by excessive quantities of rich food and this should be considered when mixing them with other species. Prospective tank mates should be able to thrive on the same diet and this may limit selection.\nSeveral different races of Tropheus duboisi exist such as Maswa and Burundi and these can be distinguished by the width and colour of the white band that develops with maturity. Juveniles are beautifully spotted and females retain these baby spots a little longer than their male counterparts. T. duboisi are recommended for those starting with this challenging group of fish and are less aggressive than many of their congeners.",
        "feeding": "A staple diet based on algae such as spirulina is recommended, together with occasional feeds of high-fibre frozen foods such as Daphnia, Mysis and Cyclops. Avoid feeding these fishes too generously. Fine sand substrates may be useful in aiding gut health by providing beneficial indigestible matter.",
        "breeding": "Males should be outnumbered with females because of their constant desire to spawn, and this harassment (which can be quite intense) will then be spread, so that no one fish bears the brunt of the males' continual amorous attention. The trickiest part of conditioning females is ensuring they have sufficient opportunity to avoid being pestered by males. Properly kept, breeding occurs naturally and females mouth brood a small clutch (<20) of very large eggs for three weeks or more. Maternal care continues a little longer and fry are capable of feeding inside their mother's mouth. Young fish are preferentially released in shallow water with rich algal growth and fewer predators - having rockwork reaching the surface or piles of small stones will provide suitable areas.",

Unfortunately, it can be a little prone to barbel infections/erosion, so it is of paramount importance that the fish are kept on a soft sand substrate (rather than gravel where waste can build up unseen) in order to protect these delicate sensory organs. Regular maintenance, including frequent partial water changes, should be carried out in order to keep these fish in good condition. Provide plenty of shady areas amongst driftwood, rocks, and areas of dense planting. Other peaceful species such as some of the smaller pencilfish, tetra, and rasboras make ideal tankmates, and their presence as dither fish in midwater will encourage the Corys out into view more often. Corydoras have the ability to breathe air intestinally, so a small gap should be left between the surface of the water and the cover slides in order for the fish to come up to the surface and take air in. It may do this numerous times per day.\nThis species is easily confused with H. adolfoi with which it occurs sympatrically, and the specific epithet duplicareum is from the Latin meaning to duplicate, in allusion to the similar colour patterns. They can be very difficult to tell apart, as although duplicareum has serrations on the posterior edge of the pectoral fin spines (adolfoi does not), these are not easily seen by eye, and may require viewing from below with a magnifying glass. duplicareum generally tends to be slightly stockier than adolfoi, and the oblique black dorsal band is often broader in duplicareum. However, there is a degree of overlap in variation of colour and markings, so these should not be relied upon completely.

        "care": "Phalloceros caudimaculatus is a livebearing species known from densely vegetated streams and ponds, as well as the sluggish sections of rivers. They prefer a heavily planted aquarium with gentle filtration and water movement, in order to emulate the natural conditions. Choose robust plants or fast growers, as many soft leaved plants will be browsed upon, although not so much if the fish are kept well fed. Floating species such as duckweed (Lemna spp.) may be used to help diffuse bright lighting. Wherever possible, it is best to keep at least 2 or 3 females to every male; this will reduce the amount of attention that any one female receives from the amorous males and will also further your chances of raising more fry. A shoal of at least 6-8 fish is preferable in a good sized tank, and although there may be a bit of minor chasing between rival males, they are rarely aggressive towards one another and generally do not cause damage. Tankmates are possible, but do ensure these are short-finned, fast-swimming, and are happy in the same cool conditions - although be aware that in such a community setting, any P. caudimaculatus fry may be at risk from predation. Some wild populations of this species inhabit mildly brackish conditions, and although most that are offered in the trade are captive bred in freshwater, it is wise to check with your dealer what conditions they are being kept in. These fish are very sensitive to changes in water chemistry, so any adjustments in parameters must be carried out gradually, and much care should be taken when performing water changes (change very small amounts on a frequent basis, but add the new water very slowly). For this reason, we would suggest this species for advanced aquarists only. The natural colour form of P. caudimaculatus is a rather plain silvery fish with a small, dark, vertical elongated mark under the dorsal fin origin, and profusions of black patches on the fins. However, there are several tank bred colour forms available in the trade, which have been assigned erroneous scientific names that are not actually valid, but are mentioned here as they are so widely used. These include the spotted form P. caudimaculatus 'reticulatus' (pictured here), a golden variety known as P. caudimaculatus 'auratus', and a spotted, golden form referred to as P. caudimaculatus 'reticulatus auratus'. The pictured fish were captive bred in the Czech Republic. The wild form of this species was deliberately introduced to Ethiopia, Malawi, Australia, and New Zealand in efforts to help control mosquito numbers. The fish have become firmly established in these countries, yet unfortunately have had negligible effects on mosquito numbers, and in some areas have actually had adverse effects on local fauna.",
        "feeding": "Small frozen foods such as baby brineshrimp, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, mini-bloodworm, white mosquito larvae, and daphnia; plus crushed flake and micropellets. Will nibble on algae, aufwuchs, and soft-leaved plants. It is important to include a good proportion of vegetable matter in the diet, and this should also limit damage to any delicate aquatic plants.",
        "breeding": "Easy. P. caudimaculatus are livebearers, which means that the females give birth to live young. After fertilisation occurs, the female gestates for around 4 weeks (temperature dependent), after which time she will give birth to up to 50 free-swimming fry (although numbers will be fewer in younger females). Whilst the adults are not usually predatory towards the young, any other fish species in the same aquarium could predate on the fry if not separated. However, a few will normally manage to survive onto adulthood when kept in a well planted aquarium with lots of natural hiding places. The young are able to take baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and microworm as soon as they are born.",

This is a peaceful species that is ideally suited to spacious, planted community aquaria. The aquarium should be mature with a dark background, tangles of driftwood, and areas of dense vegetation - leaving an open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Filtration should be efficient and should provide moderate water movement. P. brachypopterus is best maintained in groups of 5 or more due to a tightly shoaling nature, and larger group sizes will give them more confidence to venture out into the open. This species can be kept alongside most community fish without problems, with the exception of tiny fish or fry; however, do not house with large, boisterous fish as they are easily intimidated. Good companions could include medium-sized peaceful barbs or rasboras, rainbowfish, small loaches, Erethistes hara or E. horai moth catfish, bristlenose catfish, deep-bodied tetras etc. Some shops refer to these fish as 'dwarf Pangasius', such is their resemblance to the shark-like tankbusters. However, despite similar appearances, these fish will grow no longer than 11.5cm, making them a much more suitable aquarium subject. Interestingly, the 8 long barbels may be held backwards and flat against the body, or manoeuvred forwards into a shape akin to an erect umbrella without its cloth - very effective for enveloping small items of food, and fascinating to watch. P. brachypopterus is very similar in appearance to its congener P. moolenburghae, which is from the same region and is also occasionally seen in the trade. P. brachypopterus has a much shorter anal fin with approximately 30 rays, compared with P. moolenburghae, which averages 40 rays.",

Provide shady hiding places and shelters from the current, in the form of pieces of driftwood, smooth pebbles, and robust aquatic plants. Dried Indian Almond leaves on the bottom of the tank in calmer areas also provide naturalistic refuges (these will need replacing periodically). It is important that the water is kept comparatively cool and is high in dissolved oxygen, in order to replicate the natural habitat and for the continued wellbeing of these delicate bottom dwellers; they will not fare well in warm, oxygen-depleted waters. Dwarf Anchor Catfish should always be maintained in good sized groups of 6 or more due to their gregarious nature. Tankmates must be petite, peaceable, and enjoy the same water conditions - some of the smaller danionins, diminutive coolwater barbs such as Pethia gelius, or badis species such as Dario dario would make ideal companions. Boisterous bottom dwellers should be avoided, as they will intimidate and outcompete the Dwarf Anchor Catfish for food. Be sure to feed just after lights out, as these shy fish are nocturnal feeders and will not usually eat during daylight hours. Capable of minor colour change, depending on surroundings. May also be seen on sale as Anchor Catfish, Asian Stone Catfish, or Moth Catfish (although the latter is also often applied to other Hara and Erethistes spp. in light of the fact they appear moth-like when viewed from above).

        "care": "The Dwarf Cory is a peaceful little species, ideally suited to smaller softwater aquaria. Due to its diminutive adult size, it is not suitable for the general community aquarium as it may be intimidated by or preyed upon by larger tankmates. Mature, densely planted nano tanks would be perfect for this pretty, shoaling catfish. There should be a sandy substrate in order to protect the delicate sensory barbels, and some shady hiding spots amongst driftwood and broad leaved plants. Floating plants can also be useful in helping to diffuse bright lighting. Peat filtration will help to keep the water soft and acidic, and the tannins released will result in the fish showing their best colours. Unusually for a Corydoras catfish, this delightful species spends a good deal of time hovering in midwater. In the wild, Dwarf Cories form shoals with the similar looking little Reed Tetra (Hyphessobrycon elachys). Dwarf Cories should always be maintained in large sized groups of at least 10 specimens; this will not only give them more confidence, but will result in a more effective, natural-looking shoal. Other tankmates could include tiny sized characins such as Ember or Reed Tetras, micro Rasboras (Boraras spp.), or small ornamental shrimps such as Red Crystals or Cherries. Frequent partial water changes are a must, as these fish can be very sensitive to elevated nitrate levels. Corydoras have the ability to breathe air intestinally, so a small gap should be left between the surface of the water and the cover slides in order for the fish to come up to the surface and take air in. It may do this numerous times per day. This species may sometimes be confused with G. pygmaeus, but the two can be told apart fairly easily as G. pygmaeus has a dark stripe that runs along the entire length of the lateral line from the tip of the snout and onto the caudal fin (this is lacking in G. hastatus).\nGastrodermus was recently split from Corydoras and contains all the elegans group, together with the pygmy corys.",

        "breeding": "This species is said to be a little more difficult to breed than other members of the genus, as it can be difficult to raise the miniscule fry. It may be easier to attempt reproduction of this species in a dedicated breeding tank, set up with parameters matching the main tank but instead filtered by a small air driven sponge filter which should prevent any fry from being drawn in. A cooler water change may trigger your fish into spawning in the classic Corydoras \"T-position\". Soft, acidic water seems to be essential (peat filtration suggested) and a ratio of 2 males to every female tends to work best. The 1mm eggs (numbering up to 100 per female) are individually deposited, usually on the glass or amongst fine-leaved plants. Once spawning is over, the adults should be acclimatised back to the main aquarium, and the eggs can then be raised in the safety of the breeding tank, away from any predators. Many aquarists find that the addition of a small amount of methylene blue or an alder cone helps to prevent the eggs from fungussing, but any that do still fungus should be immediately removed to prevent it spreading to healthy eggs. A sand substrate actually seems to work better than a bare bottomed tank in preventing disease in this species. All being well, the eggs should hatch within 3 to 5 days, depending on water temperature. The fry will initially feed from their yolk sacs and can then be offered microscopic foodstuffs such as infusoria for the first few days, moving on to baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and microworms as they grow.",

It should be decorated with a good amount of bogwood, rocky caves/PVC tubes, and robust planting such as Anubias spp. or Java Fern (tied to the decor - plants in the substrate will be uprooted) to provide shady areas, but you should also ensure that an unobstructed swimming space is left along the front of the tank. External canister filtration is recommended, as these fish are voracious eaters and can produce a fair amount of waste. The water should be well-oxygenated with a moderate current, and frequent partial water changes are a must to help keep nitrate to a minimum. These fish are most comfortable in aquaria with subdued lighting, and the use of blue-moon type illumination is highly recommended so that you may observe a few hours of the nightly goings-on in an aquarium containing this species. Dwarf Giraffe Catfish are highly territorial, particularly towards their own kind and other bottom-dwellers. Therefore, it is best to keep only one per tank. Companions should be sizeable and robust, otherwise they will be eaten; good tankmates could include some of the medium-large sized barbs, central American cichlids, and large characins such as Distichodus spp. or silver dollars.

These fishes may benefit from a cooler winter rest to aid longevity.\nRecent years have seen the rise of a species-specific iridiovirus that effects many established commercial strains of this widely bred community favourite. This incurable 'Dwarf Gourami Disease' has meant that we now take great care over sourcing this fish and it means that we generally pay more for the enhanced biosecurity involved. Peaceful towards other species of fish, males may become territorial at breeding time when kept together in smaller tanks. Sometimes offered in batchelor groups, males are better in odd numbers to avoid bullying. To see the best from these fish, outnumber the males with females to allow the smaller, more rounded females to escape excessive harassment should the male decide to court them vigorously. A well-planted aquarium with plenty of cover and a gentle water flow will help them to feel secure.\n  Recent research has resolved the confusion over the scientific name of this species, meaning that after years of familiarity their binomial has changed, having been applied in error to the Banded or Giant gourami (now renamed T. bejae).

There should be a good amount of floating plants, to help when the male constructs his bubblenest. Once the male has finished building this nest, which can be up to an inch thick and several inches across, he will begin courting the female. This is usually in the form of him \"\u02dcdancing\"\u2122 around the female and flaring his fins. If the female \"accepts\" the male, she will swim underneath the bubblenest, where the male will embrace her, wrapping his body around hers. He will turn her onto her side and then her back, at which point, she will release some of her eggs (up to 60), which the male fertilises immediately. The eggs will float upwards towards the nest, and any that stray will be collected by the male and placed into the nest. Once happy that all the eggs are secure, the pair will repeat their spawning/egg collecting actions several times until up to 600 eggs in total have been released. The male then secures the eggs by adding another layer of bubbles beneath the eggs, and it is at this point when the female should be removed. The male will vigorously defend his nest and surrounding territory when the tank is approached. After 12-24 hours, the eggs will hatch, and after another 3 days, they will become free-swimming. The male must be removed from the tank once the fry leave the bubblenest otherwise he will eat them. The fry should be fed on tiny foods such as infusoria or finely powdered fry food for the first week or so, moving on to larger foods as they grow. It is of extreme importance to maintain a warm layer of air between the surface of the water and the coverslides at all times whilst the fry are developing their labyrinth organ, critical during the first few weeks of their life.",

The water in the native habitat is very soft and acidic, and stained a tea colour from the tannins in the decaying leaves and wood. The home aquarium should be mature, with a dark substrate and background and with plenty of plant cover - both rooted and floating - in order for these peaceful mid-to-top-dwelling fish to feel secure. Filtration should be efficient but water movement gentle. These fish are best maintained in groups of at least 10, and more than this wherever possible. Dominant males may occasionally bicker with one other, but providing there is a good network of hiding places/visual barriers for them to retreat into if necessary,  no harm should ensue. Keeping more females than males will also help to reduce any minor aggression-related problems. In the wild, these fish are found alongside many other small characins such as Axelrodia stigmatias, and various Copella and Hemigrammus species. Dwarf cichlids from the Apistogramma or Mikrogeophagus genera could also be considered as good tankmates, as well as Corydoras catfish and small loricariids. Choose companions wisely as Dwarf Pencilfish can be fairly timid and will hide away and refuse to feed if tankmates are too boisterous. If unfussy about creating an exact biotope, some of the smaller Rasbora and Boraras species from Asia would get along well with the dwarf pencilfish, as would Kuhli loaches (Pangio spp.). The colours of these fish can vary slightly, depending on the geographical location that they originated from, and as with other Nannostomus species, they assume a cryptic colour overnight so may look a little pale when the lights first switch on. Acclimatisation should be carried out very carefully, and be sure to keep up with small regular water changes to keep nitrogenous wastes at a minimum. Tight fitting coverslides are a must, as these fish are capable of jumping from an open topped aquarium.",

One or more pairs of well-conditioned adults should then be carefully acclimatised across. When ready to spawn, and whilst swimming alongside one another, the male will nudge the female\"\u2122s abdomen. The eggs will be laid/fertilised a few at a time, and these should fall into the mass of plants or down into the safety of the marbles. This will continue until up the female is spent of eggs (eggs can number up to 100 per mature female), and the parents, being voracious egg-eaters, should be removed immediately. It should be noted that some aquarists find breeding is more successful with a single pair, rather than a group, as the smaller number of adult fish present will mean less chance of predation. The eggs should hatch after 36-72 hours (temperature dependent)  with the miniscule fry using up their yolk sacs and becoming free-swimming around 3-4 days later. Feed on infusoria, rotifers, and powdered first foods  to begin with, moving on to larger foods such as microworm and Artemia nauplii as they grow.

The relatively large eggs will be scattered over the plants a few at a time, usually totalling around 20-30 per day. These fish are known as 'continual spawners' which means that the spawning activity takes place over several days/weeks. This can present problems to the aquarist in that some adult fish may begin to consume the eggs as they are scattered, although this may not be a problem if the adults are kept well fed. However, many fishkeepers have found the eggs to be remarkably tough and have had great success in siphoning them out into another aquarium (containing matching water from the spawning tank) or else using spawning mops, which, when having caught a number of the eggs, can be moved to a separate tank (again with matching water) and replaced with a new mop, as and when each series of eggs are deposited. The eggs will usually hatch in 8-9 days (dependent on temperature) and once free-swimming, the tiny fry can be offered infusoria, moving onto larger foodstuffs as they develop.

Their diminutive size means that they are one of the better choices for smaller aquaria.

Soft-neutral conditions are recommended for Otocinclus, as are areas of moderate current. Small, peaceful tankmates such some members of the Tetra, Pencilfish and Corydoras families would be suitable.

These fish are most comfortable in aquaria with subdued lighting, and the use of blue-moon type illumination is highly recommended so that you may observe a few hours of the nightly goings-on in an aquarium containing these catfish. A gregarious species, M. batesii should be kept in groups of 5 or more, and they may often be observed resting in strange positions amongst plants or decor. Ensure that heaters are covered with heater guards to prevent these catfish from being burned when looking for dark crevices to rest against. Companions should be of similar size and temperament, avoiding any large, boisterous species which may intimidate these retiring catfish.

        "care": "The Eel-tailed Banjo Catfish is known from estuaries and the lower reaches of coastal rivers in fresh and brackish environments. The habitat typically consists of shallow turbid waters with soft, silty or muddy substrates in which they like to bury. These sedentary bottom-dwellers are best kept in a large, mature aquarium with neutral to slightly hard and alkaline conditions; indeed, they can even be acclimatised very carefully to moderately brackish waters. Soft, acidic environments should be avoided as these fish will not fare well under such conditions in the long-term. Provide a soft sand substrate (gravel must be avoided) with plenty of shady hiding places amongst driftwood and rocky caves. As these fish prefer dim lighting, open expanses of sand in brightly lit tanks should be shaded with large, broad-leaved plants. These fish will usually remain partially buried during daylight hours, and the addition of dried leaf litter would further help to emulate the natural environment. However, be sure the leaves are non-toxic and do not add them in significant amounts as this could acidify the water. The addition of some form of blue moon lighting to the aquarium (which switches on just before the main lights go out) will allow you to spend time observing them under their preferred subdued illumination. Eel-tailed Banjo Catfish are peaceful towards their own kind and should be kept in groups. Tankmates must be chosen with care, as these catfish will eat small fish and shrimps (particularly any they find overnight, when they are at their most active and other tank inhabitants are resting) so ensure that companions are too large to fit into their mouths, but are still of a peaceful disposition e.g. some of the medium sized characins, rainbowfish, or livebearers. The presence of such fish swimming around in open water may even encourage these reclusive catfish out into view a bit more. In the case of the Eel-tailed Banjos being maintained in brackish aquaria, many of the usual non-aggressive brackish community fish will work well as tankmates. Observe carefully to ensure that none of the other fish are continually nipping away at the inactive,  partially buried catfish. Good filtration along with frequent partial water changes are essential for keeping nitrogenous wastes to a minimum; however, the actual water flow within the aquarium should not be excessive. No two fish share exactly the same pattern. May also be seen on sale as the Banded Banjo Catfish,  Mottled Eel-tailed Banjo Catfish, or Whiptail Banjo Catfish.",

        "breeding": "This species has not spawned in the home aquarium; however ,egg-carrying females have occasionally been imported and the eggs nurtured from there. Eel-tailed Banjo Catfish are capable of emitting a bark-like sound via quick movement of their pectoral fins - this sound is thought to aid the fish in locating each other in turbid waters during the mating season (as well as an aid to deterring predators). Spawning itself takes place in brackish waters, and there is a most unusual method of egg incubation. The female fish carries the eggs firmly attached to the underside of her body by short hair-like threads called cotylephores, and these are thought to be an adaptation that functions rather like an umbilical cord in mammals, providing the developing embryos with oxygen and nutrients (particularly useful in muddy environments). It is unclear whether the female fish is still incubating eggs when she migrates back upstream to freshwater, or whether they hatch in brackish water and the young make their own way back.",

If a female is receptive, she will accompany him to the pre-dug pit, and they will circle each other. As the female deposits eggs, she immediately takes them into her mouth and then nudges the vent of the male fish with her mouth, signalling to him to release his milt, fertilising the eggs. Males can be quite hard on mouthbrooding females, so it is best to move the female to another aquarium at this point. She will mouthbrood the eggs for 9-11 days, at which point the free-swimming fry are released. The young will start foraging for food straight away and can be offered baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii), microworms, or crushed flake as soon as they are released.

A tank measuring a minimum of 4ft long would be suitable for a pair of these fish, and should be set up with a soft, sandy substrate and tangles of driftwood. Hardy plants can be included, but as these fish are enthusiastic diggers, it would be better to opt for species such as Anubias and Microsorum, which can be trained to grow on pieces of driftwood rather than those which root in the substrate itself. Floating plants are also a good addition to help diffuse the lighting. Filtration should be efficient, ideally an external canister to cope with the amount of substrate digging and the fair amount of waste that these fish produce.

The Llanos is a vast, periodically flooded tropical grassland plain with an astonishing biodiversity and its own well defined weather comprising dry and rainy seasons. Rams are a peaceful, but delicate dwarf cichlid species that are recommended for experienced aquarists. The home aquarium should contain soft, acidic water and be biologically mature before these fishes are added. Ideally there will be dark substrate and dense planting, with plenty of hiding places/territories amongst rocks, driftwood, upturned flower pots, coconut shells etc. Floating plant cover could be used to help diffuse the light. Peat filtration and the addition of dried Indian Almond Leaves (Terminalia catappa) would be beneficial to help create the favoured conditions. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement gentle, and frequent partial water changes should be carried out in order to keep nitrate at a minimum (essential for the successful keeping of this species). Rams are best maintained as a male-female pair in a peaceful community setting, and should not be housed with any aggressive species which may bully them. Small groups of Rams can be kept together, but you may find that certain fish pair off, and when breeding, they can become a little territorial towards others. Tankmates should be small and peaceful and good companions could include Corydoras catfish, hatchetfish, pencilfish, small tetras, and suckermouth catfish.",

Females can lay up to 400 eggs (although 250 is a typical average sized brood), which both male and female will take turns in guarding and fanning with their pectoral fins. These eggs should hatch after 48-72 hours and the fry will become free-swimming after 5 days, at which stage they can be offered tiny foods such as infusoria and microworms, moving on to larger foodstuffs as they grow. The parent fish will herd the youngsters around the tank, protecting them from any potential predators. If you wish to ensure a high survival rate for your eggs/fry, it would be prudent to set up a dedicated breeding tank for this purpose.",

        "care": "The Electric Catfish is known from much of Central Africa that lies north of the Zambezi River, although it is absent from Lake Victoria and the Congo basin. This is a beast of a bottom-dweller that not only attains a large, bulky size, but is capable of discharging up to 400V - enough to stun an adult human. This significant electrical charge, generated by a unique pectoral muscle that surrounds most of the body, is used for both capturing prey and for defence. It goes without saying that this is a species that must be kept on its own. The aquarium should be as long and wide as possible, as although this is a largely sedentary species, it obviously requires a tank that is spacious enough for it to turn around comfortably. The substrate should consist of soft sand or very fine rounded gravel as the Electric Catfish spends the majority of its time on the bottom and does like to wallow. The lighting should be subdued and there should be provision of one or more large shady shelters for this nocturnal catfish to take refuge in, built from large pieces of driftwood or rocks. Do ensure that all decor is stable though, as these fish are more than capable of rearranging things. A guard should be fitted to the heater in order to protect the catfish from burning its skin if it accidentally rests against it. Better still, opt for a canister filter that has a heater built in, so the element is not situated in the tank itself. Electric Catfish are voracious eaters, so filtration must be efficient. However, as these fish prefer sluggish waters, water movement must be gentle. Frequent partial water changes are essential to keep nitrate at a minimum. Although long-term captive specimens rarely discharge during routine maintenance, any routine work should be carried out with the utmost respect and caution. Always wear heavy duty rubber gloves, as it is not worth the risk to go without. The aquarium must have a tight fitting lid, and this may need weighting down for extra security. A blue moon light timed to come on just before the main lights switch off will allow you to observe your secretive catfish under subdued illumination for a few hours into the evening. In the wild, these fish are at their most active in the 4-5 hours following sunset, and this is also when maximum electrical organ discharge occurs as this is the optimum time for hunting. An albino variant of the Electric Catfish is sometimes available.",

Smaller specimens will take bloodworm, Mysis shrimp, chopped seafood, small pieces of meat etc. Larger specimens will enjoy earthworms, prawns etc. Some will also take tablet food, but this is very much trial and error.

This is a peaceful species which should be maintained in groups of 5 or more due to shoaling nature. In the wild, G. elegans is known from forest streams and tributaries of the middle and upper Amazon River basin where the water is soft and slightly acidic, so they will always be at their best in similar conditions in the home aquarium long-term. Unusually for Corydoras, this species often spends time shoaling in midwater. However, it should still be provided with a soft sand substrate to help protect the delicate sensory barbels for when it spends time on the substrate. Regular maintenance, including frequent partial water changes, should be carried out in order to keep these fish in good condition. Provide plenty of shady areas amongst driftwood, rocks, and areas of dense planting. Other peaceful species such as some of the smaller pencilfish, tetra, and rasboras make ideal tankmates, and their presence as \"dither fish\" in midwater will encourage the Corydoras out into view more often.

        "care": "Thorichthys maculipinnis is a medium sized Central American cichlid known from the slow-moving waters of the lower and middle river valleys of the Rio Papaloapan basin of eastern Mexico. They are usually found in groups, over sandy substrates where there is much driftwood and leaf litter for cover; the water clarity varies throughout its range, and in many places it is often a little murky and so vegetation is minimal. As these fish like to sift the substrate in search of food items, it is essential that they are maintained in an aquarium with a fine, soft sand substrate. Food morsels will be eaten, and any inedible material expelled through the gills, so it is important not to use sharp sand. Ample cover should be provided in the form of driftwood and smooth rocks, leaving an open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Plants, whilst not forming a large part of their natural habitat, can be grown if fairly robust types are chosen as these cichlids are not particularly destructive, and the addition of live vegetation may make the aquarium more aesthetically pleasing. Leaf litter (e.g. dried Indian almond leaves) can be provided to create a more natural environment, but do remember to leave a decent space in the sand for these cichlids to sift through. Good water quality should be provided at all times to ensure the continued wellbeing of these beautiful fish \"\u201c a high nitrate level makes them more prone to health problems, and is so easily avoided. The aquarium really should be at least 4ft long for juveniles and preferably 5-6ft long for adults, as these fish are rather territorial when breeding. Although a pair will reproduce in smaller aquaria, you will be able to observe T. maculipinnis behaving much more naturally if there is more space available - this being somewhat suppressed in smaller aquaria. Although territorial when breeding, these cichlids are not aggressive fighters the rest of the time. Instead they will often settle minor disputes amongst themselves through sheer bluff and bluster (in a similar manner to the closely related Firemouth, they will flare their gills \"\u201c which are complete with eye spots - to make themselves appear larger and more intimidating when viewed head-on), and do not follow up these threats to the same degree as some other cichlids might. In scuffles between other more boisterous cichlids, such as many of the assertive types from Central America, the T. maculipinnis could end up coming out of it quite badly; so for this reason it is best to keep them in a colony set-up or else with other relatively placid species such as Severums (Heros sp.) or Blue Acaras (Andinoacara pulcher), for example. Do not house them with large, aggressive species, as T. maculipinnis is essentially a shy, peaceful fish outside of breeding time. Likewise, any diminutive, slow-moving tankmates should be avoided. Many aquarists have a good deal of success keeping robust livebearers such as swordtails or goodeids along with their T. maculipinnis in a spacious environment, these acting as dither fish and encouraging the cichlids out into the open. Some of the small to medium Central American characins also make good tankmates, and if you are not fussy about creating a mix of fish from different continents, rainbowfish are another good option for shoaling mid-top water fish. Armoured suckermouth catfish should be quite safe for the lower areas of the tank, but avoid Corydoras as they are too easy a target should the T. maculipinnis commence spawning. Although now superceded the T. ellioti name is still very widely used by suppliers in the trade.",

Do also include some fresh vegetable matter in the diet.",
        "breeding": "Adults are sexually mature at around 6-7cm in length and breeding is quite straightforward. Females are smaller, more rounded and show a dark blotch in the middle of their dorsal fin. Both sexes will show a spawning dress of vertical bars and select a suitable territory containing a flat rock or piece of slate (they prefer a smooth, horizontal or slightly sloping piece of decor that is in a sheltered spot) and the female will deposit between 100-500 eggs here in small batches; after each batch is laid, the male will pass over them to release his milt, then the process is repeated. The eggs should hatch within 72 hours and the parents will move the larvae to a pre-dug pit in the substrate whilst they absorb their yolk sacs. The fry will be free swimming within 3-5 days and both parents will care for them, forcefully seeing off any intruders. The fry can be offered crushed flake/powdered baby fish food and baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii), moving on to bigger foodstuffs as they grow. The length of time that the parents guard the fry for does seem to vary a little, but they usually care for their offspring until they are between 1 and 2cm in length.",

The aquarium should be at least 4ft long and aquascaped to emulate a rocky reef effect with some open expanses of sand. D\u00c3\u00a9cor such as ocean rock can be used to build sturdy structures which stretch from the base of the tank to near the surface of the water. These structures should be built with the purpose of creating many crevices for the fish to explore but constructed in such a way so as to keep the rocks stable if the fish start to dig around and underneath them. Although a substrate of coral sand or Aragonite is often recommended to help to keep the water hard and alkaline, Mbuna feel safer and show better colours over a darker substrate. The Aragonite or coral sand can always be placed into a mesh bag and kept inside the external filter for buffering purposes. Most rock-dwelling species are extremely aggressive and need to be kept under conditions of 'controlled-overcrowding' to prevent territorial disputes ending fatally - additional filtration may also be required to cope with a heavy bioload. This is a reasonably belligerent species, and it is best to keep one male in a harem situation with several females (keeping just one female with a male will result in continual harassment and possibly death). This species can be kept successfully alongside other outgoing Mbuna, although it is best to avoid fish with a similar colour pattern. May also be seen on sale as Elongate Mbuna.",

These are deposited just one or two at a time and after doing so, she immediately turns around and picks them up. At the same time, the male will rotate so that he is almost on his side, at the same time shaking and extending his anal fin, releasing his milt. The female sees the egg spots on the male\"\u2122s anal fin and attempts to pick up those \"\u0153eggs\"\u009d whilst she is picking up the real ones that she deposited, and at the same time taking in milt.

The generic placement of Danio erythromicron has undergone much debate over the past few years, with some experts initially believing the species should belong to the Microrasbora genus. May also be seen on sale as Burmese Zebra 'Rasbora'.",

        "breeding": "A small shallow tank should be furnished with clumps of Java moss and spawning mops, and the conditioned fish acclimatised across. These fish are known as \"continual spawners\" and the females will lay several eggs each day. Check the plants/mops regularly for eggs and transfer them across to a hatching tank, away from the hungry parents. The easiest way to do this is to submerge a small container into the tank and place the egg-laden mop in it and remove. The mop can then be replaced by a new one and the egg-laden mop placed into the hatching tank (which must have matching water parameters). The eggs are approx 1mm in diameter and are translucent. After 5-7 days, it is wise to intervene in the spawning process so the females do not become exhausted. Carefully catch the fish out and acclimatise them back to the main aquarium, where they can rest and be bought back into condition with nutritious feedings. The hatching aquarium should be set up with a small airstone, and the eggs within the mops can be expected to hatch within 3 days or so, by which time they will appear more pigmented. Once free-swimming (usually after a week), the fry may be offered infusoria, moving on to larger foodstuffs e.g. finely powdered fry foods and nauplii in accordance with their growth. Snails (from a disease free source) can be added to the tank to help clear up any excess food, and any that is missed should be siphoned out during the daily partial water change regime which must be carried out carefully and slowly.",

        "care": "The Emperor Tetra is an ideal species for the mature community aquarium. These beautiful, peaceful, shoaling fish should be housed in a well decorated tank that contains plenty of plants (rooted and floating) and spindly driftwood. Male fish sometimes spar with one another as they vie for the attentions of the females, but no real harm should ensue; the displays are very eye-catching as the colours of the male fish intensify and the elongated fins are spread wide. It is best to try and outnumber males with females wherever possible, which is easiest to achieve in larger groups. This will also have the added benefit of making the fish feel more secure, and will result in a more effective, natural looking shoal. Tankmates could include other species of similar size and temperament e.g. other small peaceable tetras, Corydoras catfish, pencilfish, dwarf cichlids such as Apistogramma or Mikrogeophagus spp., and some of the dwarf Loricariids. There is one other species in the same genus as the Emperor Tetra, that being the Rainbow Tetra (N. lacortei). These fish are quite similar in appearance, but easy to tell apart as male Rainbow Tetras have bright red irises. A black colour variant of the Emperor Tetra is sometimes offered for sale in the aquatics trade as Black Emperor Tetra. This was once thought to be a third species in the Nematobrycon genus (N. amphiloxus) but is now considered a colour morph and synonym of N. palmeri. Another similar-looking fish, although from a different genus altogether, is the Blue/Purple Emperor Tetra (Inpaichthys kerri). Inpaichthys do not grow quite as large and also possess an adipose fin, which is not present in Nematobrycon.",

The temperature should be set at the higher end of their preferred range, and lighting kept subdued. Spawning mops or clumps of Java moss should be placed on the bottom of the aquarium, and a well-conditioned male and female carefully acclimatised across. The fish should spawn the following morning, with just a few eggs scattered at a time, over the course of several hours. The adults are non-guarders and should be removed after spawning to prevent predation on the eggs. The eggs should hatch within 24-36 hours (depending on temperature of the water), with the fry becoming free-swimming some 4-5 days later. They should be offered infusoria as a first food, moving on to baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and microworm as they grow.",

These fish are not particularly aggressive, so can be kept in good sized groups, but tiny tankmates may be seen as a snack so are best avoided. In the wild, adult Empire Gudgeon inhabit the lower reaches of rivers and are usually found in flowing streams amongst tree roots and vegetation. Juveniles, however, are often found in turbulent brackish estuaries. The adult fish breed in freshwater and after the eggs hatch, they are carried downstream by the currents to the sea. It is thought that the fry feed and develop in brackish water, and eventually make their way back to freshwater to begin the breeding cycle all over again. Ideally the aquarium will be furnished with dark substrate, decor and background, so that the fish feel secure in their environment, which in turn will make them feel settled enough to show off their beautiful colours. They will definitely appreciate shady areas amongst dense planting, but this may be difficult to achieve if you wish to maintain these fish in brackish water. In freshwater aquaria, good tankmates could include rainbowfish, medium sized peaceful barbs or tetras, or even livebearing species such as platies or swordtails. Be aware that very tiny species may be eaten, so are not recommended. Good filtration and regular partial water changes are a must. May also be seen on sale as Australian Empire Gudgeon.",

        "breeding": "Extremely challenging. There are currently no reports of successful captive breeding, no doubt due to the special conditions that the eggs and fry need to go through during their development in the wild. The male will set up a territory in a freshwater habitat near to the bottom and will entice the female to deposit her eggs upon rocks, driftwood, or vegetation. These eggs may number up to 3000. The male guards the eggs throughout the incubation period of 10-14 hours (this will be temperature dependent), and once the eggs hatch, they would be swept towards the sea. This is very difficult to replicate in captivity and is probably why there are no successful home spawnings to report. Even if this is somehow replicated, there are many problems associated with getting the tiny fry to feed.",

However, because of the close relationship to the common Guppy (Poecilia reticulata), they hybridize readily.\n  Endler's Guppies are known only from a small area in Venezuela where the water is typically greenish and shallow at around 15cm depth. These streams are surrounded by trees, which put much of the habitat into dappled shade at various times throughout the day. The fish graze on the substrate, aquatic vegetation and algae, moving around in large groups. Usually there are more females than males. This should be replicated in the home aquarium, ideally with 2 or 3 females to every male. The tank should be densely planted and include floating species which will help diffuse bright lighting. The water should be of a hard, alkaline composition. Endler's Guppies can be kept alongside other peaceful species which enjoy the same conditions. They will breed quite readily (see below) in a heavily planted tank, so keep an eye on stocking density.\n  Wild Endler's Guppies are found in several different forms, although they've also been crossed extensively with domestic guppies to produce a wide range of colours. The variety found in the Campoma lagoon (and immediate surroundings) is the standard form and has a prominent comma-shaped black mark on the flanks. It's well worth keeping pure strains of known wild forms seperate from their guppy kin, as once they disappear from our tanks they're unlikely to return - their wild habitats are threatened by pollution and destruction. Domesticated forms and hybrids (occasionally seen as 'Mini guppies') are often more resilient than highly-bred fancy guppies thanks to greater genetic diversity.",
        "feeding": "Flake, green flake, micropellets, and small frozen foods such as baby brineshrimp, daphnia, mosquito larvae and cyclops. Microworm is also a particular favourite. May nibble at some delicate fine-leaved plants, although damage should not be that noticeable, particularly if fast growing plant species are chosen.",
        "breeding": "Easy. Keep at least two females to every male amongst dense planting and the fish will do the rest! The male will transfer his milt into the female via his gonopodium, where it is then stored and used to fertilise her eggs. Just before the live young are released, the female starts to show a dark black \"gravid spot\" near the vent. Mature females typically give birth to 10-15 fry every 28 days, but XL specimens may have 20+. The adults do not usually prey on the young, although this has happened from time to time. Heavy planting will help to ensure most of the offspring swim to safety (alternatively they may be very carefully caught and transferred to a separate rearing tank). After about 5-6 weeks, the young are sexable, with the females able to breed after just 2 months. Every so often, it is best to separate some of the youngsters from the adults, otherwise inbreeding will occur and this can lead to deformities. It is also wise to introduce a few new adults to the breeding colony on occasion too, which will also help to keep a stronger gene pool.",

The aquarium should be at least 4ft long and aquascaped to emulate a rocky reef effect. Decor such as ocean rock can be used to build sturdy structures which stretch from the base of the tank to near the surface of the water. These structures should be built with the purpose of creating many crevices for the fish to explore but constructed in such a way so as to keep the rocks stable if the fish start to dig around and underneath them. Although a substrate of coral sand or Aragonite is often recommended to help to keep the water hard and alkaline, Mbuna feel safer and show better colours over a darker substrate. The Aragonite or coral sand can always be placed into a mesh bag and kept inside the external filter for buffering purposes. Most rock-dwelling species are extremely aggressive and need to be kept under conditions of 'controlled-overcrowding' to prevent territorial disputes ending fatally - additional filtration may also be required to cope with a heavy bioload. The Exasperatus cichlid is a fairly belligerent species, and it is best to keep one male in a harem situation with several females (keeping just one female with a male will result in continual harassment and possibly death). This species can be kept successfully alongside other outgoing Mbuna, although it is best to avoid fish with a similar colour pattern. May also be seen on sale as the Pearl of Likoma.",

They will circle each other in a head to tail manner a number of times, until the female deposits her eggs. These are deposited just one or two at a time and after doing so, she immediately turns around and picks them up. At the same time, the male will rotate so that he is almost on his side, at the same time shaking and extending his anal fin, releasing his milt. The female sees the egg spots on the males anal fin and attempts to pick up those \"eggs\" whilst she is picking up the real ones that she deposited, and at the same time taking in milt. This is the method of fertilisation, and this ritual may go on for some hours.

The tank must be mature and have myriad of hiding places amongst driftwood and thick vegetation, which should include floating species to help diffuse the light.

A dark coloured substrate and background will also help the fish to feel more confident and will bring out their best colours.

A second form (pictured here), known as the Emerald or Eyespot Rasbora - with the misnomer \"Rasbora dorsiocellata macrophthalma\" - is much more colourful, with bright green reflective eyes and hints of green/blue on the flanks and red on the caudal peduncle.

In densely planted aquaria with large groups of well-conditioned B. dorsiocellata, spawnings should occur regularly with eggs being scattered over vegetation and decor. The eggs and resultant tiny larvae will be seen as food by the adults, but if there is plenty of plant cover, some should survive into adulthood. If a greater number of fry is desired, a separate bare-bottomed breeding aquarium (with air powered sponge filter) should be set up with plenty of Java moss/spawning mops and a layer of mesh raised a small way from the tank bottom so that any eggs that fail to adhere to the plants/mops fall through to safety, away from the adults. Plastic aquarium grass matting also works well for this purpose. The water conditions should match that of the main aquarium, and the temperature should be set to the warmer end of the preferred range. Carefully add one or two well-conditioned pair/s of B. dorsiocellata, and once settled they should begin to spawn the following morning. If they do not appear to be forthcoming, some small, slightly cooler water changes are usually enough to trigger them into spawning. It is recommended that the adults are moved back to the main aquarium within 48 hours as the first eggs will be starting to hatch by then. The tiny fry will feed off their yolk sacs to begin with, but will soon require suitably sized foodstuffs such as infusoria and Paramecium, moving on to slightly bigger foods such as Artemia nauplii and microworms as they grow. A variety of foods may be needed for a while as you may end up with fry of slightly different sizes from the 2 days of continual spawning.

Its fast growing nature and large adult size dictates that this formidable predator requires an aquarium of huge proportions, with corresponding powerful filtration. A Fahaka Puffer will not tolerate any other fish within the confines of the same aquarium, so each individual must be maintained as a solitary specimen in a species-only aquarium. It is not unknown for these fierce creatures to 'go for' fish that can be seen in neighbouring tanks, and there are many reports of serious injuries to fishkeepers when carrying out routine maintenance on their Fahaka Puffer tank. Many prefer to section off areas of the tank with a special tank divider as they are working on each section, to avoid accidentally provoking the puffer, which sees anything that moves as food. The tank itself should be aquascaped with plenty of shady hiding spots amongst rocky caves, and lighting should not be too bright. The substrate should be smooth because of the length of time the puffer will spend laying on it, particularly after a large meal. When it comes to feeding time, add food with caution and never place the hands directly in the tank to offer up the food. Dropping it in from a height of several inches is best. As these voracious predators can consume a lot of food in one sitting, ensure that powerful filtration and aeration is used to cope with the metabolic rate. Regular partial water changes should be carried out on a frequent basis. It is best to either locate the heater in a sump, or use a thermo-filter (filter with built in heater) as these fish can, and will, bite through them with ease. As with other puffer species, this fish can inflate when frightened or cornered. It should never be provoked into doing so, and never above water where it can take on air, which can prove fatal. If moving a Fahaka Puffer to larger quarters, the fish should be herded into a solid container under the water so as to remove the necessity of netting and lifting it clear of the water.

Here, these elegant fish form large aggregations (hundreds of fish) which forage for food together, although when of breeding age, they form monogamous pairs. The aquarium that houses this species should ideally be at least 4ft long if housing other species, with a good amount of filtration, water movement and oxygenation. The best choice of substrate would be sand and the watermust be hard and alkaline. Rocks should be used to create small outcrops, ensuring that there are ample visual barriers. Fairy Cichlids can be aggressive towards one another in the confines of the home aquarium, so broken lines of sight amongst the decor will help. These cichlids can be maintained in a species-only aquarium or as part of a Tanganyikan community with fish of similar temperament. Combining Fairy Cichlids with other species does not always work in the long run, as their breeding strategy of producing large numbers with generations of juveniles defending their burgeoning family and ever-growing home territory, will eventually leave no room for outsiders unless the aquarium is thoughtfully planned.

The young can be started off on a diet of freshly hatched brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and finely powdered \"first foods\". Brood care is fairly prolonged, and the older siblings help in guarding the subsequent generations of fry, coexisting within the same aquarium and forming a nuclear family.

Unfortunately, False Network Corys tend to be quite prone to barbel infections/erosion, so it is vitally important that the fish are kept on a soft sand substrate (rather than gravel where waste can build up unseen) in order to protect these delicate sensory organs. Regular maintenance, including frequent partial water changes, should be carried out in order to keep these fish in good condition. Provide some shady retreats amongst bogwood and areas of dense planting, and keep only with small, peaceable tankmates, such as some of the smaller sized characins/cyprinids/anabantoids or dwarf cichlids.

Here this long-whiskered predatory species lurks amongst submerged roots during daylight hours, and emerges in the evening to feed. This is a very large growing catfish, in terms of both length and weight, and kept under the right conditions, one which can live for two decades or more. An adult is going to require a gargantuan aquarium, at least 10ft long and 3ft wide, along with powerful filtration to match, so really is quite the commitment. Substrate choice is important, as coarse gravel can cause irritation, with the fish spending a great deal of time on the bottom. Gravels can also be accidentally ingested when feeding, causing health complications for the fish. A sand substrate is better, but this will be rearranged somewhat as the fish wallows. Large round pebbles (too large to swallow) can also work as a substrate, as can a bare-bottomed arrangement which is easy to keep clean. There should be at least one large shelter for the fish to take refuge in during daylight hours, and this can be fashioned from sizeable pieces of bogwood, large slates, wide bore PVC tubing etc. Provision should also be made for a roomy swimming space along the front of the aquarium for the fish to use into the night. Lighting should be fairly dim. Some aquarists like to add a blue moon light timed to come on just before the main lights switch off. This way you can observe your catfish into the evening under its preferred subdued/moonlit conditions. False Perruno Catfish are voracious eaters that produce a lot of waste, and require excellent water conditions at all times. To this end, filtration must be powerful and the water well-oxygenated. Frequent partial water changes are essential as this fish will not tolerate an elevated nitrate level. Canister filters can be employed, but sump filtration may be better as then equipment such as heaters can be kept in the sump and out of the main tank where they would be easily damaged. False Perruno Catfish are territorially aggressive towards their own kind and similar-looking bottom-dwellers, and as such should be kept singly. Tankmates, if desired, must be chosen with care as this fish has a capacious mouth and will predate on smaller species overnight. Shoals of large, adult, deep-bodied characins or cyprinids would work well. May also be seen on sale as the Marbled Pim.",

The False Siamese Flying Fox is peaceful towards other fish, but a little territorial with its own kind and similar-looking species. In the wild it has been observed moving around in loose aggregations, so is best maintained in groups of 5 or more in aquaria with plenty of visual barriers amongst the decor. In numbers less than this, they may squabble amongst themselves every so often, \"\u02dcgreying out\"\u2122 as they do so, so always aim for a good sized group in order that no single fish bears the continual brunt of any aggression. The aquarium should be aquascaped with a soft sand or very fine rounded gravel substrate, and furnished with cobbles, smooth rocks, and bogwood pieces. Lighting can be fairly bright to encourage algae growth, which the fish will enjoy browsing on for the micro-organisms it may contain. Shady areas can be provided with the layout of the rockwork/bogwood, and by growing canopies of hardy plants such as Anubias sp. or Java fern (both tied to the driftwood). Some thought should be given to creating a number of visual barriers within the aquarium at the time of aquascaping, so if any minor territorial disputes do arise, the fish can get away from the other\"\u2122s line of sight. An extremely important point to note is that Garra cambodgiensis are capable of climbing up the glass with ease, something they tend to do when newly imported or moved; therefore be absolutely sure the tank has tight fitting coverslides and that there are no small gaps that the fish can crawl out of e.g. where equipment power leads feed into the back of the hood.

Many prefer to section off areas of the tank with a special tank divider as they are working on each section, to avoid accidentally provoking the puffer, which sees anything that moves as food. The tank itself should be aquascaped with plenty of shady hiding spots amongst rocky caves and areas of dense, robust planting. The substrate should be smooth because of the length of time the puffer will spend laying on it, particularly after a large meal.

Filtration should be efficient with areas of moderate water movement and some calmer resting spots out of the current. Regular partial water changes are a must to help keep nitrate to a minimum, as these fish are particularly sensitive to the build up of pollutants. As with other puffer species, this fish can inflate when frightened or cornered. It should never be provoked into doing so, and never above water where it can take on air, which can prove fatal. If moving a Fang's Puffer to different quarters, the fish should be herded into a solid container under the water so as to remove the necessity of netting and lifting it clear of the water.",

        "care": "The Fantail Goldfish is a selectively bred double-tailed strain of the common Goldfish. Fancy goldfish have long been popular aquarium pets, and are often the aquarists first venture into keeping aquarium fish. Given appropriate housing and care, these beautiful fish can attain quite a size and live for 15-20 years. The aquarium should be spacious with a large area for oxygen exchange; the length and width of the tank are much more important than the height in this respect. Fancy goldfish grow quickly so it is best to provide them with the largest aquarium that you can from the outset. Not only will this help to avoid stunting (and the associated health problems this can bring) but it will also provide a much safer, more stable environment for them. The larger the volume of water, the more stable it will be in terms of water chemistry and temperature. Fancy goldfish are notoriously messy fish; they are voracious eaters and continually stir up the substrate in their ongoing search for food - and such considerable amounts of waste can lead to water quality issues in smaller aquaria if not monitored very closely. The larger the aquarium, the better. Efficient filtration is essential, and regular partial water changes are advised in order to keep nitrate to a minimum. The water should be well-oxygenated (of particular importance during warmer spells of weather) and this is easily achieved by the use of spray-bar returns from filters, air pumps, small powerheads with flow diverter angled towards the water's surface etc, and may be aided further by the incorporation of oxygenating aquatic plants, which the fish will also enjoy nibbling at. Various species of coolwater tolerant plants can be added to the aquarium, but these will likely require periodic replacement due to them being uprooted/eaten - something most goldfish keepers accept and allow their fish to take pleasure in. The substrate can consist of rounded gravel or sand, and decor can include smooth rocks and ornaments with no sharp edges. Fantail Goldfish are sociable creatures and should be kept in groups, either with their own kind or with other varieties of fancy goldfish. It is best, however, to avoid keeping the standard 'single-tailed' common goldfish alongside the fancy varieties, as the common goldfish is a faster swimmer and may outcompete the fancies at feeding time. Several colour varieties of Fantail Goldfish are available, including red, red and white, yellow, and calico.",
        "feeding": "Flake, pellets, sticks, along with various frozen foods such as bloodworm, white mosquito larvae, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp etc, and some vegetable matter.",
        "breeding": "Well-conditioned fancy goldfish will spawn in the home aquarium. Female fish will be noticeably rounder bellied when full of eggs, and the male fish will develop tubercles (tiny raised bumps) on the gill plates and pectoral fins. A large, slightly cooler water change is often enough to trigger ready pairs into spawning. As the temperature slowly rises back up to its usual level, the male will pursue the female around the aquarium, but generally in a non-aggressive manner. This courtship ritual may last more than a day before spawning commences, and the colours of the fish often intensify at this time. The male fish will nudge the female into the fine-leaved plants (or spawning mops), where she will then scatter eggs which the male simultaneously fertilises. Spawning can last for a number of hours, and several thousand adhesive eggs may be scattered over the plants/spawning mop. The adults will be hungry and will start to devour as many eggs as they can find, so are best moved to another aquarium. The eggs take 4-5 days to hatch, depending on water temperature. Young fancy goldfish are often brown in colour (like their ancestors) and it can take up to a year before full colouration becomes apparent.",

This attractive bottom dweller has a beautiful colour pattern that changes as the fish matures; the reticulated markings gradually morphing into simple spots. A distinctive, high dorsal fin also develops with age, the first few fin rays becoming elongated and feathery, and when spread wide, it resembles an elaborate fan. The aquarium should be spacious (at least 4ft long for juveniles) with a soft sandy substrate in order to protect the long sensory barbels. It should be decorated with a good amount of bogwood, rocky caves/PVC tubes, and robust planting to provide shady areas, but you should also ensure that a roomy swimming space is left along the front of the tank. External canister filtration is recommended, as these fish are voracious eaters and can produce a fair amount of waste. The water should be well-oxygenated with a moderate current, and frequent partial water changes are a must to help keep nitrate to a minimum. These fish are most comfortable in aquaria with subdued lighting, and the use of blue-moon type illumination is highly recommended so that you may observe a few hours of the nightly goings-on in an aquarium containing these catfish. More than one may be kept together providing that there is an abundance of hiding places and visual barriers within the tank, and they may often be observed resting in the infamous upside-down Synodontis position underneath plants or decor. Ensure that heaters are covered with heater guards to prevent these catfish from being burned when looking for dark crevices to rest against. Companions should be peaceful and larger than 5cm (2\") in length (otherwise they may be predated upon) ; good tankmates could include some of the medium sized tetras, barbs, gouramis, knifefish, large loricariids, rainbowfish, or some of the robust West African cichlid species. These fish should not be kept alongside Malawi or Tanganyikan cichlids on account of the aggressive nature of Rift Lake cichlids, and incompatible water conditions. Although commonly available, this is not a good species for the average community aquarium ; indeed, for smaller set-ups it would be better to consider slightly more petite species such as the Upside Down Catfish (S. nigriventris).

Here they inhabit lakes and the lower reaches of rivers, preferring mesotrophic waters with a muddy or sandy substrate. Due to the large adult size of this fish (girth as well as length!), an aquarium measuring 6\" x 2\" x 2\" is required. A group of youngsters can be grown on in a 4ft tank, but in most cases they will eventually require separating into compatible pairs and rehoming into larger quarters. Excellent powerful filtration should be provided at all times and partial water changes carried out 2 or 3 times per week. The tank itself should have a substrate of sand or small rounded gravel. Bogwood and rocks/slate can be used to create sheltered areas, but these should be made secure as these cichlids are more than capable of moving decor around. Bonding pieces of rock together with aquarium grade silicon sealant prior to filling the tank is sensible. Plants are usually eaten or uprooted, but some aquarists have had success with well-rooted, established hardy motherplants which have had sturdy rocks placed around the stems to prevent uprooting. If this fails and plants are still desired, plastic or silk varieties will be the way to go. This is an aggressive species which is best maintained as an established male-female pair. They are intolerant of their own kind, but can usually be combined with other robust cichlids, if the aquarium is spacious. Not to be kept with small fish. Other Central American cichlids of a similar size and temperament make great tankmates, as do large armoured catfish. However, if breeding does occur, expect aggression towards the other fish and be prepared to separate them with a tank divider or move the other fish to another aquarium for their own safety.

Thought to be largely solitary in the wild when not breeding, the complex habitats typical of most Channa make it easy for individuals to avoid one another. \nAlthough small, its aquarium should be spacious with plenty of hiding places amongst driftwood, rocky caves, and areas of dense planting. Provide an abundance of surface cover in the form of floating plant species to help diffuse the light. Filtration should be efficient with areas of moderate water movement and quieter resting areas out of the current. It is essential that the aquarium has a tight fitting lid as these fishes are expert jumpers, and a small gap must be left between the surface of the water and the coverslides in order for the fish to come up and take in humid air. Using a tall aquarium with a low water level planted in a paludarium style, greatly reduces the likelihood of jumping, as well as providing plenty of surface cover and natural control of dissolved wastes. Snakeheads are obligate air breathers, which means they must have access to atmospheric air or they will drown. Young indivduals may be kept in groups until two fish pair up but pairs should be closely monitored for aggression. These fish are best maintained in a species-only aquarium, if tankmates are desired, they must be able to tolerate the seasonally low winter temperatures required as this species needs a seasonal change in temperature and maintenance to emulate the wet and dry months. During the winter period that coincides with the dry season, the fishes' metabolism will slow down and they will not show much interest in food. The water level can be dropped, the day length should be shortened and the reduction in waste levels means that water changes can be dramatically reduced. Successful set ups really do echo the swamps that these fish call home. These annual rest periods seem to be imperative for long-term health, vitality, and breeding potential.",

        "care": "The Fire Eel is known from sluggish waters including inundated floodplains and the slower-moving reaches of rivers. Here, this nocturnal bottom-dweller stays partially buried in the substrate during the day, emerging at night to feed on benthic insect larvae, small fish, worms, and some plant material. The Fire Eel makes a great addition to the peaceful fish community where there are no small fish present. The aquarium should be spacious and furnished with a soft sand substrate so that these diggers can wallow and bury themselves. Provide plenty of hiding places amongst plant thickets, bogwood, smooth rocky caves, PVC pipes and so on. Larger specimens are capable of undermining the decor, so do ensure everything is well supported and secure - many aquarists like to place the decor on the base of the aquarium prior to adding substrate around it. Indian Almond Leaves (Terminalia catappa) are also very much appreciated as 'leaf litter', but these must be replaced on a regular basis as they gradually decompose. Lighting should be diffused with the use of floating plants, and it is also a good idea to use a blue moon light timed to come on just before the main lights go out, so that you can view the antics of these nocturnal creatures under their preferred dimly lit conditions. Although they tend to stay buried for much of the day with just their snouts protruding from the cover, they do become very active at night. Fire Eels are not particularly aggressive, but adults will take small fish overnight, so tankmates must be chosen with care. Suggested companions could include large gouramis, good sized peaceful botiid loach species, knifefish, Geophagus spp., Severums etc. The Fire Eel can be rather territorial with its own kind, so is best kept singly. However, groups of 5 or more can be kept in the same aquarium if it is exceptionally spacious and there is an abundance of visual barriers amongst the decor. A larger group will ensure that no one fish bears the continual brunt of any territorial aggression. Clean, well-filtered water is absolutely essential, but keep water movement gentle. Make certain that the aquarium has tight fitting coverslides and no gaps left where equipment feeds into the tank (holes can be blocked tightly with oversized chunks of filter sponge) as these fish are great escape artists.",
        "feeding": "Must be given frozen foods such as bloodworm, white mosquito larvae, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, daphnia etc. Larger specimens will take bigger frozen foods such as Mysis shrimp, chopped krill, prawns, lancefish etc. Dried foods are rarely accepted.",
        "breeding": "The Fire Eel has been bred in the home aquarium, but it is a rare occurrence and details are scarce. The parent fish were over 20\" in length, with between 800-1200 eggs deposited in plants. Water parameters were neutral, with the temperature set at the high end of the preferred range. The fry are said to be very delicate and require excellent water conditions and minuscule foodstuffs, taking care not to over- or under-feed.",

        "care": "The Firecracker Tropheus is known from the south-western coast of Lake Tanganyika, where it is found amongst the rocky habitat, grazing algae in the sunlit shallows.\nCurrently these fishes are in need of classification and many of the forms are known as Tropheus sp. 'Black' or T. sp. 'Red' together with their location or common name. As hybridisation may occur, it's best to keep Tropheus in groups of their own kind and these should be large in number to spread the aggression. Housing 15 or more of these feisty fishes requires a large aquarium and this should be 1.5m or more in length to allow individuals to avoid one another. Smaller groups inevitably dwindle as harassment and bullying proves too much for the females and weaker males. It is important that the entire group is added at the same time to avoid the aggression which would otherwise be directed towards any newcomers. When adding large numbers of fish in this manner, it's important that the filtration is cycled and capable of handling the waste load. Given the investment involved, the use of a matured filter and bacterial inoculation with products such as Microbe Lift are strongly advised. As always, water quality should be very carefully monitored over the first few weeks. Excellent water quality must be maintained at all times, with partial water changes carried out at least once or twice a week and this may require the addition of buffers to ensure the high pH and carbonate hardness levels required. Strong water movement will ensure high oxygen levels and helps to keep the fish fit and active.\nAlthough Tropheus can be kept in fairly bare aquaria, several separate piles of rocks should be created (instead of a continuous rocky reef) so that individuals can more easily evade one another thanks to broken sight lines. Lighting should be bright to encourage the growth of algae over the decor, which these herbivores will enjoy browsing upon. Sharp rocks (such as lava rock) should not be used as they can cause damage to the mouths of these fishes as they graze.\nAside from a tendency to kill one another best controlled by keeping them in big groups, diet is the other major factor in successful care. These fishes are very prone to bloating caused by excessive quantities of rich food and this should be considered when mixing them with other species. Prospective tank mates should be able to thrive on the same diet and this may limit selection.\nAlthough uncertain, a xanthic or blonde fish seen as Firefox, Golden Firefox, Golden Phoenix or Moliro Gold may be a colour form of this species. As it may also be the same fish as Tropheus sp. 'Black' Red Bishop, it's best to treat it as a separate species and not mix the two forms.",
        "feeding": "A staple diet based on algae such as spirulina is recommended, together with occasional feeds of high-fibre frozen foods such as Daphnia, Mysis and Cyclops. Avoid feeding these fishes too generously. Fine sand substrates may be useful in aiding gut health by providing beneficial indigestible matter.",
        "breeding": "Males should be outnumbered with females because of their constant desire to spawn, and this harassment (which can be quite intense) will then be spread, so that no one fish bears the brunt of the males' continual amorous attention. The trickiest part of conditioning females is ensuring they have sufficient opportunity to avoid being pestered by males. Properly kept, breeding occurs naturally and females mouth brood a small clutch (<20) of very large eggs for three weeks or more. Maternal care continues a little longer and fry are capable of feeding inside their mother's mouth. Young fish are preferentially released in shallow water with rich algal growth and fewer predators - having rockwork reaching the surface or piles of small stones will provide suitable areas.",

        "care": "The Firemouth Cichlid is a gregarious species known from slow-moving or still lowland waters of the lower and middle sections of rivers, canals, ditches, lagoons, and rocky ponds. Here the substrates are muddy or sandy and strewn with smooth rocks, submerged branches, leaf litter, and these waterways are packed with dense aquatic vegetation along the shorelines. These beautiful cichlids are a very popular choice for the home aquarium, on account of their relatively easy going nature (unless spawning), medium adult size, and their dazzling bright colours. As Firemouths like to sift the substrate in search of food items, it is essential that they are maintained in an aquarium with a fine, soft sand substrate. Food morsels will be eaten, and any inedible material expelled through the gills, so it is important not to use sharp sand. Ample cover should be provided in the form of driftwood, smooth rockwork, and robust aquatic plants tied to the decor, leaving an open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Clean, unused, ceramic flower pots are also readily accepted as caves, although these may detract a little from the natural aquascape. Leaf litter (e.g. dried Indian almond leaves) can be provided to create a more realistic environment, but do remember to leave a decent space in the sand for these cichlids to sift through. Good water quality should be provided at all times to ensure the continued wellbeing of these beautiful fish \"\u201c a high nitrate level makes them more prone to health problems, and is so easily avoided. The aquarium really should be at least 4ft long for juveniles and preferably 5-6ft long for a group of adults, as these fish are rather territorial when breeding. Although a pair will reproduce in smaller aquaria, you will be able to observe your Firemouth Cichlids behaving much more naturally if there is more space available - this being somewhat suppressed in smaller aquaria. Although territorial when breeding, these cichlids are not aggressive fighters the rest of the time. Instead they will often settle minor disputes amongst themselves through sheer bluff and bluster - flaring their gills (which are complete with eye spots) to make themselves appear larger and more intimidating when viewed head-on - and they do not follow up these threats to the same degree as some other cichlids might. In scuffles between other more boisterous cichlids, such as many of the assertive types from Central America, the Firemouths could end up coming out of it quite badly; so for this reason it is best to keep them in a species only set-up or else with other relatively placid species such as Severums (Heros severus) or Blue Acaras (Aequidens pulcher), for example. Do not house them with large, aggressive species, as Firemouths are essentially a shy, peaceful fish outside of breeding time. Likewise, any diminutive, slow-moving tankmates should be avoided. Many aquarists have a good deal of success keeping robust livebearers such as swordtails or goodeids along with their Firemouth Cichlids in a specious environment, these acting as dither fish and encouraging the cichlids out into the open. Some of the small to medium Central American characins also make good tankmates, and if you are not fussy about creating a mix of fish from different continents, rainbowfish are another good option for shoaling mid-top water fish. Armoured suckermouth catfish should be quite safe for the lower areas of the tank, but avoid Corydoras as they are too easy a target should the Firemouths commence spawning. This species has been introduced to Colombia, Puerto Rico, Singapore, and the USA (including Hawaii) and has become established in these countries.",
        "feeding": "Omnivorous, but be careful not to feed too much protein as they can be prone to digestive issues. They will enjoy a variety of frozen foods such as vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, white mosquito larvae, bloodworm (sparingly), Mysis, daphnia, and various dried foods such as flake, green flake, crisps, slow sinking granules, cichlid pellets, and crushed algae wafers. Do also include some fresh vegetable matter in the diet.",
        "breeding": "Firemouths are bi-parental substrate spawners. They reach sexual maturity at around 6-7cm in length and breeding is quite straightforward. The male will choose a suitable territory containing a flat rock/piece of slate (they prefer a smooth, horizontal or slightly sloping piece of d\u00c3\u00a9cor that is in a sheltered spot); although they will sometimes alternatively select a piece of driftwood, broad plant leaves, flower pots, the aquarium glass, or even a shallow depression excavated in the substrate. Here the female will deposit up to 500 eggs in small batches, and after each batch is laid, the male will immediately pass over them whilst he releases his milt, then the process is repeated. Once the eggs hatch, the parents will move the larvae to a pre-dug pit in the substrate whilst they absorb their yolk sacs. The female tends to stay close to the young, whilst the male patrols the surrounding territory. The fry should be free swimming within 3-5 days and both parents will care for them, forcefully seeing off any intruders. The fry can be offered crushed flake/powdered baby fish food and baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii), moving on to bigger foodstuffs as they grow. The length of time that the parents guard the fry for does seem to vary a little, but they usually care for their offspring until they are between 1 and 2cm in length.",

However, if you wish to raise a larger number of young, a separate breeding aquarium should be set up for this purpose. A small tank filled with water from the main tank, filtered by a simple air-driven sponge filter, and fitted with a small sized heater to keep the temperature stable, along with several large clumps of Java Moss or spawning mops is all that is required. Acclimatise well-conditioned fish (either a pair, or one male with 2 or 3 females) to the breeding aquarium, and spawning should occur quite readily and without too much intervention (sometimes a small water change is required to get them started). The eggs will be scattered over the spawning medium, and incubation typically takes around 10-14 days depending on the water temperature. It is best to move the adults back to the main aquarium after a good number of eggs have been deposited, as the adults will predate on their own eggs and fry. Newly-hatched fry will require feeding with cultured infusoria and tiny rotifers, moving on to slightly bigger foodstuffs such as vinegar eels and baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) as they grow. Vinegar eels are especially useful as a growing-on food as they tend to stay towards the top of the water, which is the area the fry will primarily feed from, so there is less wastage and less danger of fouling the water. If the clumps of plants that are used in the breeding aquarium are mature specimens, the fry will likely browse on the microorganisms present as an additional source of food. It is essential that high standards of water quality are maintained throughout.",

A substrate of sterilised marbles can be used, or else add a good amount of Java moss clumps. The well-conditioned pair should be carefully acclimatised to this aquarium and allowed to settle in to their new surroundings. Once ready to spawn, the female will scatter up to 250 eggs, the male following behind, simultaneously fertilising them. Most of the eggs should fall to the safety of the marbles/moss, but the hungry parents should be removed as soon as spawning has ceased to prevent predation. The eggs should hatch within 24-36 hours and the fry will become free-swimming after a further 4 days or so. Infusoria should be offered as a first food, moving on to newly hatched brineshrimp as they grow. The fry are particularly sensitive to any deterioration in water quality, so excellent conditions must be maintained at all times. Ensure that any (dechlorinated) fresh water used in partial water changes is of the same temperature as the breeding aquarium water, of a similar chemistry, and added very slowly to avoid any unnecessary losses.",

These cichlids feed primarily on invertebrates that live in the substrate, small molluscs being a particular favourite. The aquarium that houses this species should be at least 5ft long, with a good amount of filtration, water movement and oxygenation. The best choice of substrate would be coral sand or aragonite, which will help to keep the water hard and alkaline. Rocks should be used to create small outcrops, crevices, and caves, ensuring that there are ample visual barriers - but do also leave some generous expanses of sand. Hardy plants could also be incorporated into the aquascape if desired. Five-bar Cichlids can be very aggressive towards one another in the confines of the home aquarium; providing as much space as possible, along with plenty of broken lines of sight amongst the decor will help. These cichlids can be maintained in a species-only aquarium or as part of a robust Tanganyikan community with fish of similar size and temperament. However, if a breeding pair forms within the group, they can become exceptionally territorially aggressive, and it is often best to move them to a tank of their own at this stage. Five-bar Cichlids are intolerant of poor water conditions, so ensure small partial water changes are carried out on a frequent basis. May also be seen on sale as the Five-barred Lamprologus.",

The pair will select a suitable cave, either one that has been provided in the aquascape, or one they have excavated themselves. The female deposits her eggs (which may number up to 400) in the cave, the male immediately swimming over them and fertilising with his milt. It is not always obvious when these fish have spawned, as oftentimes they are very secretive and the cave may be hidden from view. Once spawning has finished, the female will tend to the eggs, with the male fish aggressively guarding the perimeter of the cave. The eggs should hatch within 2-3 days (temperature dependent), with the fry becoming free swimming some 5-7 days later. The young can be started off on a diet of freshly hatched brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and finely powdered \"first foods\". Brood care lasts for a further 2-3 weeks.",

This strikingly patterned bottom dweller is the only known species of Cory that sports a horizontal pattern of black and white stripes on the caudal fin, hence the common names of flagtail or bannertail. This sociable species should be kept in groups of 5 or more; this will not only create a beautiful display, but it will give these shoaling fish much more confidence to venture out into the open. Unfortunately, Flagtail Corys tend to be quite prone to barbel infections/erosion, so it is vitally important that the fish are kept on a soft sand substrate (rather than gravel where waste can build up unseen) in order to protect these delicate sensory organs. Regular maintenance, including frequent partial water changes, should be carried out in order to keep these fish in good condition. Provide some shady retreats amongst bogwood and areas of dense planting, and keep only with small, peaceable tankmates, such as some of the smaller-sized characins/cyprinids/anabantoids or dwarf cichlids.

A couple of weeks prior to the spawning attempt, ensure that your fish are well-conditioned on a varied diet of live and frozen foods. Mature fish (preferably a ratio of 2 or males to every female) may be triggered into spawning by performing a large, cool water change and increasing oxygenation. Pairs will adopt the classic T position where the male fertilizes the eggs that are held between the female's pelvic fins. The adhesive eggs will then be deposited onto plants, decor, or the sides of the aquarium etc and the process repeated. The eggs generally take around 4 days to hatch, and once free-swimming will be able to take finely-powdered first foods, microforms, and newly hatched brineshrimp. To avoid predation and to ensure a higher success rate, many fishkeepers prefer to set up a separate breeding aquarium with water parameters matching that of the main tank, along with a gentle air-driven sponge filter and clumps of Java moss. The conditioned adult can be carefully acclimatized to this tank, and once they have been triggered into spawning, they can then be moved back to the main tank after all of the the eggs have been deposited, thus hopefully ensuring a larger yield.

There should be a soft sand substrate which will be kinder on the long sensory barbels and plenty of shady hiding places amongst bogwood, rocks, robust planting, and leaf litter. Flagtail Porthole Catfish do like to dig, so be sure that all structures are secure. Filtration should be efficient, although water movement need not be too vigorous. Dim lighting is preferable; however, brighter illumination can be employed if it is diffused with floating plant species, and the use of a blue moon light is highly recommended for viewing this nocturnal species in the late evening time. A good maintenance and water change regime is a must, as these fish are sensitive to a build-up of organic wastes. Typical tankmates could include medium sized or deep bodied characins e.g. Bleeding Heart Tetras, Black Widow Tetras etc, Rainbowfish, medium-sized Rasbora species, Corydoras catfish, medium-sized Loricariids (suckermouth catfish), and more.

Firstly the tank should be biologically mature and must contain an abundance of bogwood, as this forms an essential part of the diet (these fish can actually be heard rasping their way around the aquarium!). There should be plenty of sheltered retreats created from the bogwood as well as from smooth rockwork, so that these nocturnal catfish feel comfortable during the day. They do not enjoy overly bright illumination, so ensure that there are many shady areas formed by driftwood, caves, and even floating plants, which will help to diffuse the light. Robust plants such as Anubias and Java Fern could be included (tied to the wood for best results) but avoid soft-leaved or delicate plants as these will be uprooted or eaten. Excellent water conditions should be maintained at all times via the use of a powerful filtration system that can cope with the amount of \"wood waste\". A good current and high level of oxygenation will serve the fish well, and may even tempt them into breeding. Flash Plecs are generally very peaceable, but males will squabble with one another over territory, so if planning on maintaining more than one specimen, ensure the tank is spacious and furnished with enough visual barriers and caves to keep everyone happy. These catfish are peaceful towards other types of fish and should only be kept alongside small quiet species e.g. small tetras, hatchet fish, pencilfish, rainbowfish, Corydoras catfish etc. Avoid keeping with nippy species which may find the long lyretail of the Flash Plec too tempting.\nColouration changes as this fish ages, with mature fish almost appearing to outgrow their stripes",

D\u00c3\u00a9cor such as ocean rock can be used to build sturdy structures which stretch from the base of the tank to near the surface of the water.

They will circle each other in a head to tail manner a number of times, until the female deposits her eggs. These are deposited just one or two at a time and after doing so, she immediately turns around and picks them up. At the same time, the male will rotate so that he is almost on his side, at the same time shaking and extending his anal fin, releasing his milt. The female sees the egg spots on the male\"\u2122s anal fin and attempts to pick up those \"\u0153eggs\"\u009d whilst she is picking up the real ones that she deposited, and at the same time taking in milt. This is the method of fertilisation, and this ritual may go on for some hours. The eggs may be incubated for around 3 weeks until they hatch and the resultant fry held for a further few days afterwards.",

        "care": "Tropical fish do not come much more controversial than the Flowerhorn Cichlid. This man-made hybrid is quite the 'Marmite fish' - people tend to either love 'em or hate 'em. The parentage of these impactful fish has always been something of a closely guarded secret, but when they were first glimpsed in Malaysia during the 1990s, there was much speculation that they were a cross between the Three-spot Cichlid (Amphilophus trimaculatus) and another Central American cichlid, the offspring of which was then crossed again with another cichlid, possibly a Red Parrot Cichlid (a man-made hybrid itself). Some sources claim up to 5 species were involved from multiple genera, and it remains a closely guarded secret with those who developed them. As their popularity increased, more species have been crossed in to bring in desired traits such as increased 'pearling' from species such as Herichthys. Whatever the parentage, and love them or hate them, it seems that these fish are here to stay in the fishkeeping hobby. Indeed, in parts of Asia, the Flowerhorn Cichlid is highly prized and is considered by many to bring good luck or create good 'Feng Shui', with some specimens valued at hundreds of thousands of pounds. These cichlids are of heavyset appearance, are vividly coloured, and have a distinctively shaped profile with the enormous nuchal hump. Like other large Central/South American cichlids, they are highly territorial and require a voluminous aquarium with oversized filtration to match. Provide a substrate of soft sand or small rounded gravel. Sizeable pieces of driftwood and rocks/slate can be used to create sheltered areas, but these should be made secure as these hefty cichlids are notorious diggers and they more than capable of moving decor around. Bonding pieces of rock together with aquarium grade silicon sealant prior to filling the tank is sensible. As large quantities of substrate are likely to be bulldozed on a daily basis, plants cannot be cultivated. A guard should be fitted to the heater in order to protect it against breakages, or better still, opt for a canister filter that has a heater built in, so the element is not situated in the tank itself. Partial water changes should be carried out on a very frequent basis to help keep nitrate to a minimum.\nThis is an exceptionally pugnacious fish which is best maintained singly as a pet. Tankmates could include other Central/South American cichlids of a similar size and temperament, or large armoured catfish, but always observe carefully and have a means of separating them if necessary. A significant percentage of male fish are sterile; however, if two fish do pair off intending to reproduce, expect a huge amount of aggression directed towards the other fish and be prepared to move the tankmates to another aquarium for their own safety. Sometimes the male can be very persistent when wanting to breed, and if the female is not receptive, he may harm her. So always observe carefully and have a tank divider on hand, should the need arise to separate an overly amorous male from his female. Ensure the aquarium has a tight fitting hood that is weighted down, as these sturdy fish are expert jumpers. Despite its controversial origins with a seemingly unprecedented level of hybridisation, large adult size, and belligerent nature, this remains a popular fish with many cichlid enthusiasts. Several colour varieties exist including the original Louhan, along with forms that have been hybridised further such as Golden Monkey, Kamfa, Fader, and Zhen Zhu.",
        "feeding": "Omnivorous. This species requires a balanced diet in order to retain good colours. Slow sinking pellets/sticks, frozen foods such as Mysis shrimp, krill, chopped cockle, chopped mussel meat and prawns will all be taken with much enthusiasm. Be sure to provide a vegetable component to the diet, such as spinach, kale, lettuce and cucumber.",
        "breeding": "The Flowerhorn Cichlid has been bred in the home aquarium, but it can be difficult establishing a compatible pair, plus there is the added problem that male fish are not always fertile. Simply placing a male and female together is unlikely to work and may have disastrous consequences. It is far better to obtain a group of juveniles and grow them on, letting a pair form naturally from the group. However, you would need to have a plan in place for rehoming the remaining fish. Even then, if the female is not receptive, the male may end up killing her, so always have a tank divider on hand should things get violent. Courtship is a vigorous affair, with much mouthing and tail slapping. Again, have the tank divider handy in case things get a bit out of control. Eggs are usually deposited on a vertical piece of slate, a flat piece of driftwood, or in a rocky cave. Up to 1000 eggs will be laid/fertilised, and these can be expected to hatch within 72 hours. The parents will then move the wrigglers to a pre-dug pit. They will become free-swimming after a further few days when their yolk sacs are used up, and can be offered baby brineshrimp or crushed flake. At this point, it would be wise to separate the male from the female using the tank divider, as the male will be hyper-aggressive in defence of the fry. If carrying out maintenance on the tank, he is quite likely to attack your hands, so be very careful. Parental care usually continues for around 6 weeks. Please be aware that a bonded pair may reproduce on a regular basis, and always in exceptionally large numbers. Therefore, it is important to consider whether you should really allow your Flowerhorns to reproduce in the home aquarium, and should have a homing plan in place for the potentially hundreds, if not thousands, of juvenile fish (that are going to attain a substantial size), which are going to quickly overwhelm an aquarium. Once the fry have been removed from the aquarium, observe the adults carefully as the male may attempt to spawn again immediately, and the female may not be ready.",

        "care": "The Flying Fox is known from the Indonesian islands of Borneo, Java, and Sumatra, plus Peninsular Malaysia, and southern Thailand. Here, it is found in rivers and streams with moderate current, over rocky and sandy substrates. It is frequently observed underneath floating objects such as boats, floating houses, and dense pockets of surface vegetation. The aquarium should be mature, and at least 4ft (120cm) long with areas of decent water movement and a good level of oxygenation. The Flying Fox is usually reasonably peaceful towards other fish, but adults can be rather territorial with their own kind and similar-looking species. It is best maintained singly or in groups of 5 or more in aquaria with plenty of visual barriers amongst the decor. In numbers less than this, they will frequently squabble amongst themselves, so always aim for a good sized group in order that no single fish bears the continual brunt of any aggression. The aquarium should be aquascaped with a soft sand or very fine rounded gravel substrate, and furnished with cobbles, smooth rocks, and bogwood pieces. Lighting can be fairly bright to encourage algae growth, which the fish will enjoy browsing on for the micro-organisms it may contain. Shady areas can be provided with the layout of the rockwork/bogwood, and by growing canopies of hardy plants such as Anubias sp. or Java fern (both tied to the driftwood). Some thought should be given to creating a number of visual barriers within the aquarium at the time of aquascaping, so if any minor territorial disputes do arise, the fish can get away from the other\"\u2122s line of sight. Bottom dwelling tankmates could include many of the peaceful botiid river loaches, the nemacheilid brook loaches, and suckermouth catfish. For the upper levels, consider some of the Barilius, Danio, Devario, Opsarius, and smaller members of the Puntius genus (research individual species to ensure compatibility before purchase though, as not every species from these genera will be suitable). Flying Foxes can be fairly boisterous at feeding times and are not recommended for housing alongside slow-moving laterally-compressed fish such as discus or angelfish. As with other fish that inhabit flowing waters, these fish are sensitive to the build-up of organic wastes, so ensure the tank is efficiently filtered and regular partial water changes are carried out in order to keep nitrate to a minimum. Ensure that the tank has tight fitting coverslides and there are no gaps where equipment feeds into the tank, as Flying Foxes are expert jumpers.

        "care": "The Forktail Loach is known from the marginal areas of shallow rainforest streams that often cut through ancient acidic peat bogs, and mostly (but not always) where the water is soft, tannin-stained and clear. Here, these elongate bottom-dwellers tend to reside amongst the marginal vegetation and underneath the leaf litter that has fallen from the shady canopy above. Water movement may be quite variable depending on the time of year and altitude, although in general it is moderately fast, becoming swifter during the rainy season. The aquarium should be mature, spacious (4ft long +), and aquascaped with a soft sand substrate, plenty of smooth water worn pebbles/cobbles, bogwood, and areas of dense planting. Plants will need to be fairly robust to cope with the reasonable water flow, so species such as Java Fern and Anubias sp. that can be tied to the decor are recommended, as is Cryptocoryne balansae which can be planted into the substrate. If housing smaller specimens, be sure to protect them from any filter or powerhead intakes as they do like to try and squeeze into tiny nooks and crevices. It is best to maintain this species in good sized groups (this is more natural), however, they can be a little territorial towards their own kind at times, so it is important to allow several hiding places per fish, with lots of visual barriers breaking up lines of sight. Tankmates should be small and peaceful, as nippy species may target the long dorsal and caudal fin of the Forktail Loach. Good companions could include some of the smaller/more peaceable Nemacheilid loaches, Lepidocephalus/ Lepidocephalichthys spp., Yunnanilus spp., many small cyprinids such as Danios and Rasboras, and small Rainbowfish species. Like other fish that inhabit fresh running waters, these loaches will not tolerate a build-up of nitrates within the aquarium and require excellent water conditions at all times if they are to thrive - so efficient filtration and regular partial water changes are essential. In fact, the fish will often swim out in the open and into the current when a percentage of the water is changed, in obvious enjoyment. As Forktail Loaches are largely nocturnal, it is worth investing in a blue moon light that can be timed to come on for a few hours just as the main lights switch off. This should enable you to view some of their natural behaviour during the evenings. Ensure that the aquarium has tight fitting coverslides with no gaps where equipment feeds into the tank, as these fish can jump - particularly when newly acclimatised. In summary: a very special and much sought after loach species that is only sporadically seen in the trade, which will require a dedicated set-up if it is to thrive.

These diminutive fish are members of the family Pseudomugilidae (Blue Eyes). They make wonderful additions to the small-medium planted aquarium housing other petite, peaceful species, or even showcased as a single species shoal in a high end aquascape. The tank should be mature and have areas of dense vegetation, including some floating species, along with several tangles of driftwood (the spindly Sumatra wood is ideal) to help diffuse the light. Dark background and substrate choices will help to bring out the colours of these active fish. Filtration should be efficient, and the water well-oxygenated, but the flow should not be too strong. Always maintain Forktail Rainbowfish in groups of 10 or more specimens, ideally with one or two females to every male. Not only will this make the fish less nervous, but it will also result in a more effective, natural-looking display. Male fish will put on quite a show as they compete with one another for female attention, but no real damage should ensue during such sparring sessions.

Avoid keeping alongside slow-moving fish that have long trailing fins, such as gouramis, as they may be nipped at.

The eggs, which are relatively large, should be removed to another tank (with matching water conditions) after each spawning, as otherwise the hungry parents will consume them. Each batch of eggs becomes progressively smaller. The eggs usually hatch within 14-21 days, the timescale being very dependent on water temperature. The fry should be offered infusoria and powdered fry foods, moving on to baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) as they grow. Frequent partial water changes should be carried out with the utmost of care, as the fry are extremely sensitive to changes in their environment. Sexually mature at 3-4 months of age.",

It belongs to the Peacock group of cichlids and is found in the intermediate zone, where rocky shores give way to wide expanses of sand. Unusually, it shows a preference for rocky caves, which is in contrast to many other Aulonocara species that prefer an open expanse of sand in which they can forage for sand-dwelling invertebrates. The aquarium should be at least 4ft long and aquascaped with open expanses of sand in addition to a number of rocky areas including caves. D\u00c3\u00a9cor such as ocean rock can be used to build sturdy structures which stretch from the base of the tank to near the surface of the water. These structures should be built with the purpose of creating many crevices for the fish to explore but constructed in such a way so as to keep the rocks stable if the fish start to dig around and underneath them. Although a substrate of coral sand or Aragonite is often recommended to help to keep the water hard and alkaline, Peacocks feel safer and show better colours over a darker substrate. The Aragonite or coral sand can always be placed into a mesh bag and kept inside the external filter for buffering purposes. This is a relatively peaceful species (as far as Malawi cichlids are concerned), however, whilst it may be tempting to add more of the colourful males than females to your setup, this is unnatural for a Peacock colony and will result in territorial disputes and stress. The ideal combination would be one or two males with a larger group (5+) of females. This species can be kept successfully alongside midwater Haps such as Copadichromis, Cyrtocara, Placidochromis etc and some of the more easygoing Mbuna (such as Labidochromis caeruleus). However, it should be the only Peacock species in the aquarium in order to avoid hybridisation. May also be seen on sale as the Malawi Butterfly Peacock.",

He will choose a spawning site and dig a small depression in the substrate after which time he will pursue and show off to all the females in the tank until one accepts him and follows to the spawning site. They will circle each other in a head to tail manner a number of times, until the female deposits her eggs. These are deposited just one or two at a time and after doing so, she immediately turns around and picks them up. At the same time, the male will rotate so that he is almost on his side, at the same time shaking and extending his anal fin, releasing his milt. The female sees the egg spots on the male\"\u2122s anal fin and attempts to pick up those \"\u0153eggs\"\u009d whilst she is picking up the real ones that she deposited, and at the same time taking in milt. This is the method of fertilisation, and this ritual may go on for some hours. The eggs may be incubated for around 3 weeks until they hatch and the resultant fry held for a further few days afterwards. Typical brood size numbers around 50.",

Create plenty of hiding places using smooth rocks/cobbles, large shells, tangles of driftwood, and dense clumps of hardy vegetation. Species such as Anubias and Vallisneria will cope well with harder water. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement fairly gentle. Small, frequent water changes will help keep nitrate to a minimum, particularly important as this species is especially sensitive to deteriorating water conditions. It may be beneficial to longterm health to give this species occasional exposure to brackish conditions and they are also suitable for a low salinity aquarium. Also known as the Schooling Bumblebee Goby, this species is more social than others in the genus so it is always best to keep a large sized group (8 or more) so that any territorial behaviour is spread evenly throughout the group, with no single fish bearing the continual brunt of it. Smaller groups do not often fare as well. Ensure there are plenty of caves and crevices (visual barriers) in order for males to form their territories when in the mood for spawning. Tankmates are largely ignored but problems can occur with competition at feeding time, when fast-moving midwater fishes are likely to consume most of the food before these fussy bottom-dwellers get to it. Thawing frozen foods and pouring them from a container of water can allow particles to disperse around the aquarium to help ensure that all of the inhabitants get their share.

There should be a multitude of hiding places amongst rocky caves, pvc tubes, and hardy plants such as Java fern or Anubias. Filtration should be efficient with areas of moderate water movement, and some quieter resting areas out of the current. Frequent partial water changes are essential to keep nitrate to a minimum. A high KH is important in keeping this fish healthy and it can also be kept in brackish or marine aquaria. Longterm health may benefit from the addition of saltwater, especially for females which appear gravid. Moray Eels are highly predatory, however, they may be kept in groups in spacious aquaria and are usually compatible with other placid species too large to swallow. Although their eyesight is rather poor, moray eels have a keen sense of smell and can detect movement vibrations very well, quickly lunging at any potential prey. This includes the hands, so much care should be taken when carrying out maintenance on the aquarium - they are capable of giving a nasty bite! In order to prevent building an association between fingers and food, it's wise to avoid hand feeding morays of any kind.

Here it lurks concealed in the soft mire until prey items unwittingly swim past, are lunged at with lightning speed, and are swallowed whole. Due to the capacious mouth, it is capable of taking fish that are almost as big as itself. It goes without saying that this is a fish best kept in a species-only environment. However, groups of Frogmouth Catfish can be kept together, but all specimens should be of very similar size and all should be added simultaneously. Sedentary by nature, this species does not require huge quarters and it will be at home in a tank around 3ft long (larger for a pair or group). The substrate must consist of soft sand as this is a species that habitually burrows. Lighting should be dim and there should be a few shady retreats constructed from driftwood or rocks. Plants that can cope with low levels of lighting, such as Java Fern (Microsorum spp.) may be attached to and trained to grow on some of the decor. Anything planted into the substrate is at risk of being uprooted when the catfish wallows. Leaf litter is also a welcome addition to the Frogmouth Catfish aquarium, as it will enjoy concealing itself beneath these. Dried Indian Almond Leaves (Terminalia catappa) are readily available in many stores and are ideal, but these will require periodic replacement. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement gentle. Frequent partial water changes are a must to prevent the build up of nitrate. Interestingly, the Frogmouth Catfish appears to lower the pH of the water within the confines of the home aquarium (this phenomenon is particularly noticeable in smaller tanks), so it is important to test the water regularly and add a buffer if necessary. It is not clear why this occurs, and several theories abound, but it is something that the aquarist should be prepared to monitor from week to week.",

        "care": "The Frontosa Cichlid is endemic to the northern half of Lake Tanganyika, where it inhabits the deep, rocky habitat, and is most abundant at depths of 30-120m. Here, this species gathers in large aggregations of up to 1000 individuals, feeding on smaller fish and macro-invertebrates. Interestingly, individual size seems to increase with depth, with the largest specimens found in the deepest waters. The eventual adult size and fast-growing nature of these hefty fish necessitates a very spacious aquarium from the outset. A minimum 5-6ft long tank is recommended for growing on a group of juveniles, and these will require much larger quarters (around 8ft x 2ft x 2ft) within a few years if stunting is to be avoided. This is a long-lived fish, with 25 years not unusual under optimal conditions, so it is quite the commitment. Filtration must be powerful, ideally provided by one or more external canisters, and there should be a good level of oxygenation. The best choice of substrate would be coral sand or aragonite, which will help to keep the water hard and alkaline, and, as these fish are deep water dwellers, the aquarium lighting must not be excessively bright. Smooth rocks should be used to create outcrops and plenty of large, shady caves and crevices, ensuring that there is more than one hiding place per fish. However, do also be sure to leave ample open swimming space for these fish to cruise along, and ensure that all structures are stable. Frontosa Cichlids are susceptible to deteriorating water conditions, so frequent partial water changes are absolutely essential, ideally around 25% twice per week. As a gregarious species, Frontosas should always be maintained in good sized groups of 5 or more (7-10 is better) allowing the fish to form a complex social hierarchy with a distinct pecking order. These cichlids are not overly aggressive and can be maintained as part of a Tanganyikan community with fish of similar size and temperament. However, do not mix them with much smaller fish as they will be eaten, and likewise, belligerent species may intimidate them so are best avoided. Interestingly, C. frontosa is restricted to the northern half of the lake, whereas the similar-looking congener, C. gibberosa is allopatrically distributed in the southern half. There are many geographical variants of the Frontosa Cichlid, and these are usually imported under the name of the locale at which they were collected, for example 'Bulu Point', 'Burundi', 'Chaitika', 'Ikola', 'Kapampa', 'Kavala', 'Kipili', and 'Mpimbwe'. There is a particularly sought-after form from Kigoma that displays 7 dark vertical bars instead of the usual 6, and the popular variant known as the 'Blue Zaire' is actually a form of the southern congener, C. gibberosa.",

He will select a suitable area which he will weakly defend and attempt to entice a female into. This could simply be a moderately secluded area in the tank or a cave/ large flowerpot on its side etc. When he has her attention, they will clean the spawning site together, then he will slowly swim around the area with his fins folded and will release some milt (this is thought to trigger the female into laying her eggs). She then passes slowly over the same area, and after releasing an egg into the milty water , immediately backs up and picks it up. This process is repeated several times, during which the male may or may not release additional milt, until a total of 20-50 large eggs have been taken up into the female's mouth. She will hold the eggs for a lengthy period of 5-7 weeks, and once hatched, the young fry will begin feeding on inhaled particles of food whilst still inside her buccal cavity.",

Once the nest has been constructed, the male will then display around it, shaking and showing off his intense colouration, attempting to attract a female. He may be quite insistent in his pursuit, which is why it is best to spawn this species in a harem situation in order to help diffuse his amorous intentions. If a female is receptive, she will deposit eggs in the spawning site and then immediately take them up into her mouth. The male stays very close by during this time, and as the female turns to pick up the eggs, the male drags his elongate ventral fins over the sand. The yellow fin tips attract her attention, and she follows, attempting to snatch up what she perceives to be eggs and instead takes up sperm from the male, fertilising the eggs in her mouth. The female will carry the brood of 15-40 eggs in her mouth for 3-4 weeks before releasing the free-swimming fry. She will not eat during this time.

Here, this piscivorous species is found in shallow, vegetated areas, and the intermediate sand-rock habitat. The aquarium should be at least 6ft long and aquascaped with open expanses of sand in addition to a few rocky areas and some thickets of Vallisneria. Decor such as ocean rock can be used to build sturdy structures which stretch from the base of the tank to near the surface of the water. These structures should be built with the purpose of creating many crevices for the fish to explore but constructed in such a way so as to keep the rocks stable if the fish start to dig around and underneath them. Although a substrate of coral sand or Aragonite is often recommended to help to keep the water hard and alkaline, these fish feel safer and show better colours over a darker substrate. The Aragonite or coral sand can always be placed into a mesh bag and kept inside the external filter for buffering purposes. The Fusco Hap is solitary in nature and can be kept singly in the aquarium, or one male with a harem of several females. Tankmates must be chosen with care as smaller fish will be eaten. Suitable companions could include other large rift lake species such as Dimidiochromis compressiceps, Fossorochromis rostratus, other sizeable Haplochromis/Nimbochromis species, large Synodontis catfish etc.",

Here, they are found in clear, cool, swiftly-flowing hillstreams over pebbly substrates. These pretty, torpedo shaped loaches are members of a group of bottom dwellers referred to as Brook Loaches, and they occupy a similar, but not quite so harsh niche to that of the balitorids (Hillstream Loaches). Nemacheilidae is a huge and diverse family, currently containing over 450 species and is comprised of many popular genera, including Aborichthys, Acanthocobitis, Mesonoemacheilus, Nemacheilus, Schistura, and Yunnanilus. A requisite for their care is highly oxygenated water with plenty of current, and tight fitting coverslides are a must. The Galaxy Loach can be a little territorial with conspecifics, and should be kept in spacious aquaria with plenty of \"\u02dcvisual barriers\"\u2122 amongst the d\u00c3\u00a9cor. Their antagonistic behaviour is not so much of an issue in the wild, where fish can easily move from one territory to another, but it can certainly present problems within the confines of the aquarium. Provide a sandy substrate along with plenty of nooks and crannies formed from pebbles, rocks, pieces of slate, and tangles of driftwood - ensuring that lines of sight are broken up. Plants are not found in any great abundance in the fast-flowing waters of the natural habitat of the Galaxy Loach, so are not considered essential; however, robust species such as Anubias and Microsorum tied onto driftwood will help with water quality and will make the aquarium look more aesthetically pleasing, as well as creating more hiding places. The best way to keep these loaches is either singly, as a known compatible pair, or in dense groups (10+). Larger groups mean that any territorial aggression is spread amongst the shoal, so that no one fish bears the continual brunt of any sporadic antagonistic behaviour. Galaxy Loaches do not usually show aggression towards other current-loving fish, providing that they are not other nemacheilids. Nonetheless, tiny placid tankmates are best avoided, as are species with long fins. Good companions could include some of the smaller Barbs, Barilius/Opsarius, temperate Bitterlings, Crossocheilus, Danios, Devarios, or Garras, and shoals of these will act as 'dither fish', encouraging the loaches out into the open. Like other species that inhabit fresh running waters, these loaches will not tolerate a build-up of nitrates within the aquarium and require excellent water conditions at all times if they are to thrive - so powerful filtration and regular partial water changes are essential.

Their koi heritage brings either a gold or silver metallic sheen, which adds colour to a fish with rapid growth rate and vigour. 'Ghosties' have all the charisma of koi in a cheaper and hardier package, making them very popular with pond keepers. Like koi, they grow large and often show a faster growth rate thanks to their food fish ancestry, particularly those with reduced 'mirror carp' scalation.\nThere's no denying that their price puts them in more typical garden ponds than purebred koi but they're equally large and destructive fish, so bear this in mind before adding youngsters. To see them at their very best, keep them as you would koi - in big, deep, well-filtered ponds. To ensure healthy development and maximise water volume, a pond designed for carp should be at least 1.2m/4' deep but the bigger the better. These are pets that get better with age and tend to outgrow smaller facilities, this leads to serious owners often upgrading their ponds as their fishes mature. Large, greedy carp in big ponds need serious filtration and this is a factor to be considered at the planning stage, with helpful hardware such as bottom drains installed in the early stages of construction. The fact that many standard garden ponds have one or two swimming amongst goldfish and orfe is a tribute to how hardy they are, and they'll enjoy uprooting the plants and foraging in the mud in the same way their wild ancestors did. The fact that dedicated carp ponds tend to be bare is testament to the fact that they demolish most attempts at planting, so ensure any vegetation is out of reach and consider adding a 'plant filter' where the benefit of waste removal can be harnessed safe from the fishes. Unlike wildlife ponds, carp ponds are best filled using tap water to ensure healthy mineral content - keepers in soft water areas are advised to add buffers to increase KH levels and monitor these alongside the usual parameters such as ammonia and nitrite. As these conditions favour the growth of algae, an ultraviolet clarifier is usually an essential piece of equipment to maintain the clear water that allows you to appreciate your pets.\nAs well as a few variations such as White ghost and Golden ghost, these fishes may also be seen on sale as Ghost Carp.\nAs Koi are now reclassified as Cyprinus rubrofuscus and Common carp remain Cyprinus carpio, these fish should now be considered hybrids.",
        "feeding": "Good quality specialised diets are available for all sizes of these fish including pellets and sticks. Take care to avoid the temptation of overfeeding - adding food little and often will soon train the fish to associate their owner with food. Feeding is linked to temperature and it's important to offer a cold weather formulation in late autumn, winter and early spring. Prawns, earthworms, lettuce and even orange segments are all good treats to be fed now and again.",
        "breeding": "Although Ghost Koi are able to reproduce with one another, expect a high percentage of offspring that revert to the original parent fish. Spawnings will occur naturally in the pond if sexually mature males and females are present, where conditions are to their liking (water quality, water temperature, light levels etc), and where there is a medium such as mops/ropes/brushes where the eggs can be scattered. However, many spawnings go unnoticed as the eggs are often consumed quickly by the parents and other fish in the pond (and even other predators such as dragonfly larvae, snails, and tadpoles). To ensure survival of the eggs/fry, the aquarist will usually have to intervene, collecting the eggs before they are devoured, and keeping them in a spacious container with pond plants and some continuous form of gentle oxygenation. The eggs typically hatch within 4-5 days, and the fry will feed on their yolk sacs for the first few days, after which time a constant supply of small live foods such as infusoria and daphnia will be required. Koi, of course, can be selectively bred in separate breeding ponds if the aquarist is fortunate to have access to this type of set-up. In this scenario, the water of the breeding pond should match that of the main pond, and it should be lined with spawning ropes and the like. A well-conditioned selected pair can then be added and observed regularly for signs of spawning. Once the eggs have been deposited over the spawning medium, these can be separated from the parents and grown on in an independent container as described above.",

Most,if not all exports come from various West African countries. These large sizedshrimps may appear rather fearsome at first glance, but they are actually verypeaceful aquarium residents with modified claws (chelae) that resemble fans,which they splay wide like nets in order to catch tiny particles of food. Agood sized, mature aquarium is required, with areas of vigorous current andplenty of shady hiding places. Some wood, flat stones and rocks should beplaced in the path of the flow so that the shrimps may perch there, fanning thewater for food particles. Good filtration, clean and stable water conditions,along with decent water circulation is obviously a must for this species. Thecurrent within the aquarium can be further enhanced by the use of smallpowerheads (be sure that the model you use comes with a protective cage orfilter-sponge underneath to prevent the shrimp from being drawn into themotor). Giant Fan Shrimps are sociable and should be kept in large groups. Onoccasion, they may become a little territorial with each other; however, thisis more noticeable in smaller tanks, which is why it is important to give themspace. These shrimp can be kept safely with plants, although due to the watermovement, hardier species should be chosen. Tankmates should be small andpeaceful - avoid all pufferfish, large barbs, large aggressive botiid loaches,most cichlids etc. These shrimp are often seen in a variety of natural coloursin the shops, from sky blue, mid blue, navy blue, to grey and brown.

There are also reports of the occasional maleshrimp turning orange or red \"\u201c this is thought to be a display of dominance,but further study is needed. Smaller specimens will moult fairly often, untilthey attain their adult size. Moulting usually takes place overnight, and theshrimp may hide for a few days afterwards whilst the new casing hardens, asnaturally this is when they are at their most vulnerable to predators. Caremust be taken when carrying out partial water changes, as Giant Fan Shrimp,like all shrimp species, are sensitive to fluctuating water temperatures.

Although itis not uncommon to see eggs being carried by the females, raising thenewly-hatched miniscule translucent larvae presents quite a problem as theyrequire brackish water to change into miniature shrimp (known as post-larvae).The adults will not tolerate salt in the aquarium, which makes transferral andacclimatisation of the larvae into brackish conditions very difficult andrisky. In nature, the larvae would be washed into saltier waters where theywould develop whilst drifting in a planktonic state, and return to freshwaterafter several moults and taking on a miniature shrimp appearance. The minisculesize of the larvae means that an appropriately sized sponge medium must be usedon the sponge filter in the brackish growing-on tank so that the larvae do notget dragged into the sponge filter. The larvae will not tolerate nitrate, sofeeding can also present problems. Small amounts of green marine water aresuggested as a first food.",

        "care": "A popular food fish in its homeland, the Giant Gourami has a wide area of distribution. As such, is found in a variety of different habitats, including canals, lakes, marshes, rivers, swamps, and even bodies of stagnant water. Here, it lurks amongst aquatic vegetation, feeding on both plant and animal life, including frogs, insects, shrimps, smaller fish, and worms. This is a sizeable surface dweller, in terms of both length and weight, and kept under the right conditions, one which can live for two decades or more. An adult is going to require a voluminous aquarium, at least 2m long and 70cm wide, along with powerful filtration to match, so really is quite the commitment. Substrate choice is unimportant, but do provide several large shelters in the form of rocky caves and driftwood tangles, making sure that all structures are secure. All but the most robust of plants will be uprooted and eaten, although some aquarists have had a degree of success with mature Anubias sp. and Java Fern motherplants tied onto the decor, and tough-leaved floating species which will help diffuse the light. Otherwise, plastic or silk varieties could be used to create the illusion of a green and leafy aquascape. Provision should also be made for a roomy swimming space along the front of the aquarium, particularly the upper levels. Giant Gouramis are voracious eaters that produce a lot of waste and filtration must be powerful and the water well-oxygenated. Frequent partial water changes are essential to help keep nitrates to a minimum. Canister filters can be employed, but sump filtration may be better as then equipment such as heaters can be kept in the sump and out of the main tank where they would be easily damaged. The Giant Gourami regularly takes breaths of air, so a suitable gap should be left between the surface of the water and the coverslides at all times. This species is best maintained singly in all but the largest of aquaria, as adults will often show territorial aggression towards their own kind. Although generally quite peaceful with other species of similar size, the Giant Gourami should not be kept with fishes small enough to swalow as they may be eaten. Can be kept successfully alongside other sizeable, non-aggressive fish. There are reports of very aggressive rogue individuals, but this behaviour only tends to manifest if the fish is housed in quarters that are too cramped. ***Please note that Maidenhead Aquatics does not specifically order this species for our stores, but we do help to rehome the occasional specimen, hence why we are providing care information here. ***",
        "feeding": "Offer a varied selection of meaty foods along with some fresh vegetable matter. Smaller specimens will take bloodworm, Mysis shrimp, chopped seafood etc. Larger specimens will enjoy earthworms, prawns, crab, crayfish etc. Most will also eat pellet foods.",
        "breeding": "The Giant Gourami has been bred in the home aquarium. As this species is sexually mature from around 6 months of age, breeding can be attempted with relatively small sized pairs. The breeding tank should be spacious, with plenty of surface vegetation, and the temperature set to the higher end of the preferred range. The male fish will construct a bubble nest in amongst the floating plants, and when spawning is underway, the male fish will place the eggs in the nest. The female will be driven away fairly aggressively at this point, and it is best to move her to the safety of another aquarium. The eggs should hatch within 24-36 hours, with the fry becoming free-swimming some 3-5 days later. In the wild, the male has been observed guarding the fry for a further 2-3 weeks, but it may be prudent to move him to another aquarium when breeding in captivity. Once free-swimming, the fry can be offered baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and powdered flake first foods. Giant Gouramis always reproduce in large numbers. Therefore, it is important to have a homing plan in place for (potentially) hundreds, if not thousands, of juvenile fish (which are going to get very big) - as they can quickly overwhelm an aquarium.",

Here it favours heavily vegetated, slow-flowing backwaters, inundated fields, marshes, oxbow lakes, quiet streams, and swamps.\nThis elongate surface dweller attains quite a length, and as such, requires a spacious aquarium that is at least 6ft long. The greater the length of the tank, the better, as this will help reduce the likelihood of these fish damaging the needle-like snout. The tank should be biologically mature with a sandy substrate and plenty of cover in the form of driftwood and tall, robust planting. Floating vegetation can also be used to help diffuse bright lighting and will make the fish feel more secure. It is important that the aquarium lights switch on and off gradually, as these fish can be a little skittish and react nervously to sudden changes in illumination. Likewise, the tank should be situated in a quiet area so that it doesn't receive continual foot traffic going past. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement fairly gentle, and frequent partial water changes will help keep nitrate to a minimum - especially important as this species is rather sensitive to the build up of pollutants. Although the Giant Halfbeak is predatory, it is a peaceful species that can be kept alongside fish that are too large to swallow, and can be maintained in a community aquarium of medium-large sized peaceable fish. Juvenile fish are gregarious and may be seen schooling in large sized groups, and although this instinct isn't as marked in adult fish, they tend to do best when maintained in groups of 5 or more. Avoid keeping with small fish or with boisterous fish that may outcompete the Giant Halfbeaks at feeding time. Ensure that the tank has tight fitting coverslides, as these fish are expert jumpers.\nMay also be seen on sale as the Freshwater Needlefish.",
        "feeding": "Can be tricky, particularly when first introduced to new surroundings. The diet should be tailored to the size of your particular specimens. Small live or (defrosted) frozen foods are best for younger fish e.g. bloodworm, white mosquito larvae, daphnia, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp etc. Larger specimens will take bigger foodstuffs such as Mysis shrimp, river shrimp, chopped prawns, small pieces of white fish, chopped mussel meat, and small earthworms (make sure these are clean and free of any pesticides). May eventually take some dried foods, but is unlikely. Observe to make sure any dried foods that are offered are actually taken, as otherwise the rotting uneaten food can easily foul the aquarium water. Warning: Will eat any fish that can fit into their deceptively cavernous mouths!",
        "breeding": "This oviparous species has been bred in the home aquarium, but it is not a regular occurrence. When ready to spawn, the male swims parallel to the female and begins shuddering from side to side. The pair then position themselves close to aquatic vegetation, with the male assuming a slight head-down position as he curls his anal fin under the female's vent. The pair remain entwined until a single large egg is released and attached via sticky threads to plant leaves. These fish are continual spawners, with each female producing around 12 eggs per day. As soon as they are seen, the eggs can be carefully transferred to a separate aquarium with matching water parameters in order to avoid predation. There is no parental care. The eggs typically take 7-10 days to hatch (temperature dependent), and the fry can be offered baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) soon after hatching. The youngsters may need separating by size as they grow, as larger individuals will consume their smaller siblings.",

Larger groups should be given much more territory. The substrate should consist of natural coloured sand or fine gravel, and dark shady areas should be provided with plenty of plants, bogwood, and caves. Java moss covered coconut shells or clean new flowerpots are particular favourite hideaways, and a pair is likely to choose such a location as a spawning site. Excellent water quality should be maintained at all times, and boisterous tankmates are not advised. If kept in cramped quarters, breeding pairs will become quite aggressive towards their tankmates, so adequate space must be provided.\nAs mentioned above, the giant aspect of this fish probably stems from the size of imported specimens rather than a tendency to grow larger than the common kribs which they resemble. They may be seen occasionally as Green krib, which may cause confusion due to the various colour forms. Typically sacrimontis displays darker colouration and females have an unmarked dorsal fin.

Courting pairs are easy to spot as they select and modify a spawning site, with the female displaying her belly as a sign of her readiness to deposit eggs. The male\u2019s primary role is to defend the territory and he will require an outlet for this aggression to ensure that he does not direct this hormonally induced behaviour at his mate. Without a common enemy, many cichlid pairs tend to bicker, and a threat is required in the form of target fish (which must be able to escape the defended territory to safety for their own welfare) or even a mirror attached to the outside of one of the aquarium panes. Often, the first signs that spawning is occurring is when the pair disappear for some time into one of their favourite caves. Once the eggs have been deposited and fertilised, they will take approximately 5 days to hatch and a further 3 or 4 days to become free-swimming. A typical brood size would be around 40-50 young. The parents are very defensive of the fry and will be seen herding them around the aquarium, where they will forage on live foods such as newly hatched brine shrimp and microworms. Once the young fishes are independent it\u2019s best to remove them before the adults attempt to drive them away.",

The home aquarium should be biologically mature and well filtered, but water movement should be kept as gentle as possible. Soft, acidic water is preferable, and this can be helped along with the addition of peat to the aquarium filter. Dark d\u00c3\u00a9cor and plenty of bogwood, caves, and planting - including floating species - will all help these fish to feel secure. It is imperative that the tank has tight fitting coverslides as these fish are highly skilled jumpers (in the wild this species has been observed leaving the water and flying some 2.75m/9ft); and do ensure there are no escape holes where equipment feeds into the tank (block any gaps with filter sponge). Giant Silver Hatchetfish are a timid shoaling species, which congregate in large numbers in nature; for this reason, they must be kept in groups of 6 or more (10+ is better) in order to feel secure and display natural behaviour.

Good companions could include small peaceable tetras, pencilfish, Corydoras catfish, dwarf cichlids such as Apistogramma or Mikrogeophagus, and some of the smaller Loricariidae (suckermouth catfish). Much attention must be paid to water quality since Giant Silver Hatchets can be sensitive to elevated nitrates and swings in water chemistry.

This hefty, characterful bottom-dweller requires a very spacious aquarium with a soft sand substrate. The footprint of the tank (length and width) is much more important than the height, so always aim for a tank as long and wide as possible. Juveniles grow quickly and so a voluminous aquarium is required from the outset. There should be a number of hiding places/visual barriers amongst large driftwood pieces, rocky caves, and wide-bore PVC pipes. The more hiding places that are provided, the more the catfish is likely to venture out and about, as it will get to know it has safe places to quickly retreat to if it feels the need. Dim lighting is preferred, but this can be brighter if it is diffused with robust motherplants such as Anubias or Java Fern tied onto the decor, or floating vegetation. A blue moon light timed to come on just before the main lights switch off will provide you with time in the evening to watch the nocturnal antics of this catfish under its preferred subdued conditions. These fish are messy eaters and therefore produce a lot of nitrogenous waste, so it is essential to run powerful filtration on the aquarium - ideally with 2 or more canister filters, so that if one should fail or requires maintenance, there is back up. Frequent, partial water changes are an absolute must in order to keep the nitrate level as low as possible. There should be areas of brisk water movement, coupled with calmer areas, and a balance of shady retreats and ample swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Ensure that your heater has a safety guard fitted, as these catfish have a habit of resting up against the heater and can end up with severe burns. Despite its adult size, this is a gentle giant that is best maintained in groups if space permits. It can even be trusted with smaller fish, although to be absolutely sure, these should be at least 25% of the length of the catfish.

Giraffe Catfish can be very characterful and are famed for developing into real \"pet fish\" that recognise and interact with their owners. Young specimens grow very quickly, so it is vital that they are provided with vast quarters from the outset, in order to prevent stunting and associated health problems. The footprint of the tank (length and width) is much more important than the height, so always aim for a tank as long and wide as possible.

There should be areas of brisk water movement, coupled with calmer areas, and a balance of shady caves and ample swimming space along the front of the aquarium.

Good tankmates could include several of the larger African characins (Distichodus spp., large tetras etc.) or medium-large sized barbs. Many aquarists have had success in keeping them alongside their large rift lake cichlids, but long-term, the extreme hard, alkaline water is not ideal for the Giraffe Catfish. Frequent, large, partial water changes are an absolute must. Juvenile fish (as pictured here) show a mottled giraffe-like pattern, which becomes uniform grey-brown as they grow.

This medium sized danionin is best suited to large sub-tropical river type aquaria with decent current and high level of oxygenation. Giraffe Danios are generally quite peaceful, although they tend to be rather boisterous at feeding times; slow, shy, and long-finned tankmates are best avoided. As a shoaling species, these fish should be maintained in groups of 6 or more (10+ is better if space allows). The tank should be furnished with smooth rocks (pebbles, cobbles etc) as well as tangles of driftwood. Robust plants that are able to cope with some current, such as Java Fern (Microsorum spp.) and Anubias spp. could be tied onto the wood. A spacious swimming area should be left along the front of the aquarium for these active fish to enjoy. As riverine fish that are used to continual fresh, clean waters being conveyed to them, regular partial water changes on the aquarium are absolutely essential as they are very sensitive to the build-up of organic wastes. Good companions could include many of the subtropical loaches (nemacheilids or botiids), catfish, Garra spp., Barilius/Opsarius spp., bitterlings etc. Be sure that the tank has tight fitting coverslides with no gaps where equipment feeds into the aquarium, as these fish are accomplished jumpers.

        "care": "The Glass Fish is known from a variety of different sluggish or standing, heavily vegetated, lowland habitats - chiefly freshwater, but some mildly brackish - including inner estuaries, marshes, impoundments, lakes, rivers, and streams. The home aquarium should be mature, with a dark substrate and background and furnished with driftwood and plenty of plant cover - both rooted and floating - in order for these peaceful fish to feel secure and show their best colours. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement gentle, and small frequent water changes will help keep nitrate to a minimum. Glass Fish are gregarious and should be kept in large sized groups of 6 or more (10+ is better). This is a peaceable and somewhat shy species that can be kept alongside other fish of similar size and temperament, although the water conditions (freshwater or mildly brackish) will dictate which companions are suitable. In freshwater aquaria, they could be kept alongside dwarf gouramis, small barbs, dwarf rainbowfish, Rasboras, small loaches, or some of the larger Erethistes catfish, and under mildly brackish conditions, small livebearers would make good tankmates. Unfortunately, for many years, these transparent fish have been injected intramuscularly with coloured fluorescent dyes at Asian fish farms in a bid to make them more eye-catching/sellable. This is a repugnant and totally unnecessary process that is carried out using a large needle to repeatedly inject the unfortunate fish, which are then quickly sold on as 'disco fish' or 'painted glass fish'. Most fish do not live long after this painful process has been carried out, due to shock and infections at the injection sites. Thankfully, dyed fish are seldom seen in the UK these days due to high-profile campaigning to try and prevent them from being imported and sold. Glass Fish are beautiful in their natural form, and such practices are abhorrent and must be discouraged. It should also be noted, that despite old literature implying these fish should be kept in brackish conditions, such information is erroneous. They are primarily freshwater fish and are only ever found in few very mildly brackish habitats - so for best long-term health, should never be added to full strength brackish aquaria.

        "breeding": "The Glass Fish has been bred in the home aquarium, but the fry can be tricky to raise. In the wild, this species spawns at the onset of rains during the monsoon season. When in breeding condition, the subtle colours of the male will intensify and the females will become visibly fuller bodied. A separate spawning tank should be set up with matching water parameters, gentle air-driven filtration, and numerous clumps of fine leaved plants such as Java Moss. A large partial water change in the evening may encourage the fish to spawn early the next morning, when the first rays of sunshine hit the aquarium glass. Up to 500 adhesive eggs per female will be scattered over the plants. The adults will predate on the eggs, so it is best to acclimatise them back to the main aquarium once spawning has ceased. The eggs are very prone to fungussing, so many aquarists like to dose the tank with a weak methylene blue solution to help prevent this. The eggs should hatch within 24 hours, with the fry becoming free-swimming after a further 3 days or so. The young do not seem to actively seek out food, instead waiting for it to drift past, so it will need to be presented to them in the form of heavy feedings of infusoria, powdered fry foods, and baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) borne on a gentle current within the tank. However, with such heavy feedings, it is obviously essential to keep on top of water quality at all times via testing and frequent small water changes.",

        "care": "The Glass Knifefish is widely distributed across South America, from the Rio Magdalena drainage east of the Andes in Colombia, to the La Plata River basin in eastern Argentina. It can be found in a variety of different biotopes due to the large area of distribution, but in general, it prefers deep ponds with aquatic substrates rich in plant debris, and is also found underneath islands of floating meadows in the floodplains. This nocturnal oddball is a micro-predator of insect larvae and small fish, and possesses a weakly discharging neurogenic electric organ and ampullary electro receptors that are distributed from head to tail. This means that the fish can not only sense electrical impulses, but can send them as well. These electrosensory systems are used mainly for electro-location, navigation, and communication, and are relatively weak as electric fish go, so pose no risk to the aquarist. This is a endearing fish which has an elongate, semi-transparent body. It moves in a graceful manner by undulating the long anal fin - which stretches the length of the belly, from just under the base of the pectoral fins to the caudal peduncle - and is capable of swimming forwards or backwards with ease. The Glass Knifefish is reasonably easy to keep, provided that some key requirements are met. Firstly, the male fish in particular grow very large, and, like other knifefish, cannot really bend - so a voluminous aquarium (at least 6ft long and a minimum 2.5ft wide) is a must. Secondly, the knifefish must be provided with a choice of shady hiding spots e.g. wide PVC tubes, rocky caves/overhangs (do ensure such structures are stable), large tangles of driftwood, and leaf litter (dried Indian Almond leaves are ideal, but will require periodical replacement). The lighting should not be too bright as these nocturnal fish are sensitive to intense illumination; if the tank must be brightly lit in some areas, provide plenty of broad leaved aquatic plants and floating species to help diffuse the light. Nonetheless, there absolutely must be areas of darkness within the tank that the fish can retreat to during the day as necessary. The substrate should consist of soft sand in order that the fish may grub about safely when searching for food, and so that the delicate anal fin does not become torn in any sharp gravel. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement not too vigorous. A consistent maintenance regime encompassing regular small partial water changes is important, as these fish are sensitive to elevated nitrate and sudden changes in water chemistry. Glass Knifefish are of a peaceful nature and are somewhat timid. They can be safely kept alongside other fish of similar size and temperament, and their gregarious nature means they should be kept in good sized groups of 6 or more. It is not recommended, however, that they are kept with any other knifefish species, any boisterous species, or any small species (which includes shrimp and snails) that would be considered a snack. Blue moon lighting, timed to come on just before the main lights switch off in the evening, is useful in observing your knifefish for a few hours under their preferred subdued illumination. Hopefully, if the tank is maintained appropriately and new fish are quarantined carefully before adding the main aquarium, the need for medications should not arise. However, if treatment is required, take much care as these fish are classed as 'scaleless' and are particularly sensitive to medications (always check with the manufacturer before using - some treatments are not safe, and others may need half dosing). Many aquarists also find that running a UV steriliser on the tank helps to eliminate pathogens and safeguards against the need for putting treatment in the water. This is a long-lived and fascinating species to look after, but this fish is quite a commitment so do ensure that all of its specific care requirements can be met before purchase.

Vegetation planted into the substrate is likely to be dug up, so is best avoided. Filtration should be efficient with areas of moderate water movement and some calmer resting spots out of the current. Frequent partial water changes will help keep nitrate to a minimum, particularly important as this species is sensitive to deteriorating water conditions. These eartheaters are best described as semi-aggressive and should be maintained as a multi-male (3 or more) mixed sex group in large aquaria, or as a single male with a harem of several females in smaller set ups. Male fish will spend much of their time competing with rival males, particularly when ready to spawn. Tankmates should be chosen with care, avoiding small fish; ideal companions could include other South American cichlids of similar size and temperament, deep-bodied tetras, Loricariids (suckermouth catfish), and large Brochis catfish.\nDespite its current scientific classification, this cichlid does not actually have all that much in common with the true eartheaters, and together with the rest of the Red hump group (steindachneri, pellegrini, crassilabrus and a few other undescribed fishes) it's very likely that it will be moved from the Geophagus genus at some point.",

She will then immediately back up and take the eggs into her oral cavity, and will then position herself near to the male's vent to take in milt, which fertilises the eggs intrabucally. This will be repeated many times, until ~60 eggs have been fertilised and taken into the female's mouth for incubation. Once the female has gathered up all the eggs, the pair disperse, with the female providing broodcare on her own. Many aquarists choose to remove the male from the tank at this point to prevent stress or injury to the holding female. Incubation takes around 14-21 days, and upon release, the young can be offered baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and crushed flake foods. The female demonstrates excellent broodcare and will offer the fry shelter in her mouth for a further 3 weeks or so, after which time the youngsters will have become too large to all fit in her mouth at once.",

Males are inclined to be rather competitive with one another and show the marbled pattern seen in other forms when at their most assertive. These fish have long been used as a larger accent fish amongst smaller shoaling species and the key to successful cohabitation is to keep them occupied. Although gouramis are often sold as pairs, these are not monogamous fish and males will court females in the knowledge that they'd leave his territory if they weren't interested. In the confines of an aquarium this is not an option, so add multiple females to spread the male's attention. The sexes can be easily distinguished by the shape of their dorsal fin - small and rounded in females, long and pointed in males. As this fish comes in many colour forms such as Blue, Opaline, Three-spot, Gold and White (a very pale strain of gold) these can all be mixed if you so desire. To allow them to avoid one another on occasion, the aquarium should be over 90cm/36\" in length, with a good amount of aquatic planting to provide shelter and break the sightlines.

        "care": "One of the most iconic suckermouth catfish in the hobby, the Gold Nugget Plec is a spectacular species from the highly oxygenated, fast-flowing waters of the Xingu river basin in Brazil. Younger fish form groups of several individuals, where they live under flat rocks in warm, shallow stretches of rapids, whereas adults inhabit larger spaces amongst submerged boulders where water is forced past the rocks at speed and is saturated with oxygen. The aquarium should be mature, with a soft sand substrate and various pieces of smooth rockwork and bogwood arranged to create lots of shady caves and crevices. There should be brisk water movement and a high level of oxygenation, perhaps provided by a river-tank manifold or powerheads (in addition to the current generated by the filtration). These large bottom-dwellers require warmer than average water temperatures, and will not do well below 25 \u00b0C. Unless the aquarium is of vast proportions and provides a plethora of visual barriers, it is best to keep only one per tank, as these fish can be fiercely territorial with conspecifics and other bottom dwellers that occupy the same niche; indeed, it is not unknown for mature specimens to harass and kill other Golden Nuggets and similar species when kept in slightly cramped quarters, so choose tankmates cautiously and observe carefully. Companions should ideally occupy the middle and upper levels, be reasonably peaceful, and be able to thrive in warm, soft water with decent current - some of the medium sized characins or rheophilic cichlids are an excellent choice. Although these fish prefer a diet high in vegetable matter, they will not make any real impact on nuisance algae and must be offered a varied diet (see below). When they are actively grazing, they are actually searching for their natural food source - aufwuchs - which is a type of algae biofilm that contains small invertebrate life. Robust aquarium plants are rarely eaten, but larger fish may uproot them in their ongoing search for food items. Ensure that regular partial water changes are carried out as these catfish produce a fair amount of waste and will not tolerate an elevated nitrate level. Several fish that, have in the past, been assigned different L-numbers, are now considered to be geographical variations of one and the same species of Gold Nugget (Baryancistrus xanthellus): these are L018, L085, L177, and LDA060. The fish sold under these name tags have a combination of features that, with the exception of the similar-looking L081 (another Baryancistrus with very fine spotting, at this time thought to be a different species from the lower rio Xingu), is specific to this group of Gold Nugget Plecs. These characteristics include yellow distal bands on the dorsal and caudal fin and numerous yellow spots over the entire body. L018 is thought to be the juvenile version of L085, both being found along the stretch of water known as Volta Grande do rio Xingu and from the rio Iriri (a major tributary of the rio Xingu). L177 is from further upstream near where the rio Iriri joins the Xingu and this population tends to display much larger yellow spots than the other variants. LDA060 is a form that shows irregular shaped spots or blotches. It is also worth noting that there is quite a large variation in markings from one individual to the next, which further confuses matters. Additionally, the striking yellow fin margins tend to disappear with age in these fish, but they nevertheless remain a very eye-catching species. Recommended for mature aquaria and experienced aquarists only.",

Simply placing a male and female fish together is unlikely to work long term, and the male could end up injuring the female if they are not compatible. It may be possible to spot juveniles pairing off in your dealer's tanks, otherwise, it is best to use a clear divider and let the fish get used to seeing one another for a few weeks before removing the divider and observing carefully. Tankmates are not an option if these cichlids decide to breed, so if there are other fish in the tank, they will need to be moved for their own safety. In order to encourage successful breeding, the water should be soft and slightly acidic, with the temperature set at the higher end of the preferred range and the fish conditioned on plenty of frozen foods. Spawning often follows a large, cool water change. The pair will chose and clean a spawning site, usually a flat rock or a pit dug in the substrate. The female then deposits a line of eggs before moving away and allowing the male to move in and fertilise them. This process is repeated until up to 600 eggs are laid/fertilised, and these should hatch within 3-4 days. The female will tend to the eggs during this time, whilst the male vigorously defends the perimeter. Upon hatching, the fry are moved to a pre-dug pit in the substrate, where they will stay until the yolk sac has been absorbed. The young should become free-swimming within a further week, and can then be offered baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and powdered first foods. It is always best to leave the fry with the parents until broodcare begins to cease (usually 4-6 weeks) because if they are removed early, the male may attempt another spawning with the female, and if she is not receptive, he may kill her.

        "care": "Possibly more familiar to anglers than pond keepers, tench are a native fish that have found a place in garden ponds thanks to their bottom-dwelling lifestyle. Wild fishes are found in still waters with muddy bottoms, where they grub around in search of insect larvae and edible detritus - a feeding style that endears them to pond keepers as they have a reputation for cleaning up any scraps overlooked by other fish. Their value as working fish comes more from the fact that their activity stirs sediment which can then be removed by filtration. Tench have small scales and thick body mucous, so much so that they gained a folklore reputation as \"doctor fish\" which other species would rub against to benefit from the healing power of their slime. This is obviously untrue but it's unusual to see these hardy fish looking unwell, apart from when they occasionally lay on the sides to rest during cold winter weather.\nA quietly social species, tench are best kept in pairs or small groups whose activity can often be tracked by watching for bubbles rising from any pockets of sediment they disturb while feeding. Once they learn where the food comes from, these fish may well feed from the surface alongside goldfish and other species. Tench are totally unaggressive but will feed on a range of invertebrates that includes small pond snails and may be uncomfortable in the bare surroundings of a koi pond.\nGold can be a very generous description of colour for these fish and they'll often show dark spots and blotches, with exceptional fish sometimes showing white patches too. These distinctive markings are a good way to tell individuals apart - a useful thing when happy tench may be a bit elusive in a well-planted pond. Gold tench are often smaller than their green cousins and may be a better choice for more modestly sized garden ponds, although still growing larger than goldfish.",

        "care": "The Gold Tetra is known from the slower moving portions of rivers and their tributaries, plus coastal creeks and floodplains, where they sometimes enter slightly brackish waters. These fish are actually fairly modest in colour, but in some regions, populations are exposed to a certain type of trematode parasite which induces a cutaneous reaction; the fish excreting guanin as protection, in turn rendering the fish a dazzling metallic colour (hence the common name). This has led to some taxonomic confusion in the past, with the golden coloured tetras initially being described as a new species - H. armstrongi - but now that the skin reaction is well documented, this is now considered a synonym of H. rodwayi. It's highly likely that the slimmer silver fishes seen in the trade are actually Hyphessobrycon saizi, with rodwayi being deeper bodied and more rarely seen. Tank bred fish do not display the gold or silver colouration, as they are not exposed to the parasite in captivity. Wild imports of metallic fish are available from time to time, and these highly reflective specimens are truly spectacular. \nThe aquarium for these fish should be well-established and contain soft, acidic water. There should be a sandy substrate and an abundance of driftwood tangles for the fish to explore, along with some dried Indian almond leaves (Terminalia catappa) scattered on top of the sand (these will require periodic replacement). The tannins leached from  the wood and leaves should impart a clear, tea-coloured tint to the water, which will not only help to acidify the environment, but will also ensure the fish feel more secure and will bring out their natural colours. Peat added to the aquarium filter will also be very beneficial. Plants are not abundant in the natural habitat of this species, but may make the tank more aesthetically pleasing. Gold Tetras are a peaceful shoaling species that should always be maintained in good sized groups; we would suggest a minimum of 6 specimens, but preferably 10 or more. Tankmates should be small and peaceable and enjoy the same softwater conditions. Other peaceful Hemigrammus or Hyphessobrycon spp. tetras, pencilfish, hatchet fish, dwarf cichlids (Apistogramma sp. and Mikrogeophagus sp.), Corydoras catfish, and smaller Loricariids (suckermouth catfish) make excellent companions. Acclimatisation should be carried out carefully, and be sure to keep up with small regular water changes to keep nitrogenous wastes at a minimum. Filtration should be efficient but water movement not too vigorous.",
        "feeding": "Offer a varied diet including a good quality flake, micropellets, and small frozen foods such as bloodworm, white mosquito larvae, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, and daphnia.",
        "breeding": "This egg-laying species is relatively easy to breed, and in the confines of a well planted tank, you may see small numbers of young appear from time to time. Bear in mind that the young will not display the metallic sheen of their parents. However if you wish to raise a good number of fry, a small separate breeding aquarium should be set up for the purpose. This tank should also contain soft, acidic water, and the temperature should be set towards the high end of their preferred range. Prior to the spawning attempt, condition your fish on plenty of small meaty live or frozen foods. Clumps of Java moss or a few bunches of fine-leaved plants should be added to the breeding tank to give the fish somewhere to scatter their eggs, and very gentle filtration should be provided via an air-driven sponge filter (a small bag of peat can be incorporated here). No dedicated lighting should be used, as eggs and fry tend to be light sensitive. Acclimatise a mix of both sexes across to the new tank very carefully during the evening, and in the morning, when sunlight hits the tank, spawning should commence. The parents should be removed immediately after spawning ceases as they will predate on the eggs. Some aquarists like to use a fine mesh in the tank so that the scattered eggs can fall to safety, away from the attention of the adult fish. Ideally try and keep the tank in darkness once eggs have been scattered, to protect them and the resultant sensitive young fry from being damaged by bright light. The eggs should hatch within 24-36 hours (temperature dependent) and the young will initially feed from their yolk sacs. Once free-swimming (usually after 3-4 days), microscopic foodstuffs such as infusoria/Paramecium should then be offered, followed by baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and microworm as they grow.",

Although much of their care requirements will be similar to the more familiar Congo tetra (P. interruptus) these fish are considerably less domesticated and should be kept in softwater with low nitrates. Low lighting will make them feel more comfortable and floating plants can help to provide this, as well as helping with water quality. As a shoaling species these fish are best kept in large numbers, which will give them greater confidence and inspire the males to develop their best colouration as they compete to intimidate each other and impress the females. Under these circumstance they will tend to ignore most tankmates but long-finned species may prove too tempting to ignore.

As plants are not found in any great abundance in the natural habitat, they can be omitted from the aquascape, although a few areas of hardy vegetation (that can cope with current) will make the aquarium look more aesthetically pleasing and will help with water quality. Ample hiding places/visual barriers amongst the decor will enable you to keep a group of these fish together and will obviously further your chances of breeding them. Male Hypancistrus are fairly territorial and care should be taken to provide plenty of caves. Tankmates must be small and peaceful, and able to thrive in warm, fast-flowing water.

The temperature of the water should be raised to 28 \u00b0C and it must be extremely well-filtered and highly oxygenated. Provide a selection of small caves which have an entrance only marginally bigger than the fish. These can either be formed from arranging the rockwork in such a way that small, secluded crevices are created, or pre-constructed from small pieces of slate siliconed together. It is crucial that these caves are situated in an area with decent water movement. When in spawning condition, males will choose a preferred cave and defend it from any other males present, whilst at the same time, will try to entice a ripe female inside. Spawning does not always take place straight away; indeed, it can be some days before the female is ready to deposit her eggs, but the fish will remain inside the cave together during this time, the male usually blocks the entrance. Once the eggs have been laid and fertilised, the male fish often has to force the female out of the cave before he begins his parental guarding duties. The female plays no further part in brood care, but the male will be seen fanning the eggs with his pectoral fins and blocking the cave entrance from any intruders. Eggs typically number around 45 and take around a week to hatch. The fry will feed from their sizeable yolk sacs for the first few days, and after this has been consumed, they will require very regular feedings of baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii), microworms, and various small or crushed dried sinking foods. It is important that food is available to the fry at all times as they can all too easily starve but keep a very close eye on water quality when feeding constantly and perform lots of very regular but very small partial changes to keep nitrogenous waste levels as low as possible. The adults pose no threat to the fry, but other fish sharing the same tank might do.

This is linked to the extreme cold in parts of its native range and this tolerance is seen in their colourful descendants, as Orfe will feed and function in much colder water than Koi or Goldfish. This preference for oxygen-rich water means that these fish can struggle in small ponds with slow-moving water and are renowned for jumping from ponds during summer storms. The fact that these active fish don't eat plants and are seldom affected by disease made them very popular with pond keepers for decades, until their place was usurped by the more friendly and colourful Koi carp. Orfe still make an excellent choice for large ponds that have good water movement but are too shallow for carp, or where lush planting is desired. If this includes a waterfall or stream then they'll be very happy as this will help keep oxygen levels high overnight when submerged plants are busy producing CO2.\nThe active nature of these sociable fish makes them popular with keepers who enjoy watching them leaping for insects in summer and cruising in active shoals, but this activity can make other fishes such as koi a bit more nervous. Large specimens are also predatory enough to make an impact on small fish, although they will ignore anything too large to swallow. Insects are eagerly taken and young fishes have an insatiable appetite for mosquito larvae, driven by a rapid growth rate.

In the wild, these fish are found in slow moving rivers, streams and lakes, the locations of which are of a high altitude and they are also heavy with aquatic vegetation. It is not unknown for them to move into swamps, paddy fields and even slightly brackish waters in some areas, and they thrive on eating the mosquito larvae which land on the water's surface. The aquarium itself should be aquascaped with plenty of plants, including floating varieties wherever possible. This will give the fish a natural network of hiding places and territories. Tangles of driftwood can also be added to give additional shelter. Golden Wonder Panchax are accomplished jumpers, so it is essential that the tank has tight fitting coverslides. These fish are predatory and have surprisingly wide mouths (view them head-on). Therefore they should never be combined with small community fish e.g. Neon Tetras, as these will soon become a snack. Golden Wonder Panchax are best maintained with medium sized fish of a peaceful disposition, and which do not occupy the same extreme top level of the aquarium.",

In the wild, this species is known from flooded savannahs of the low-lying coastal zones; consequently in the home aquarium they will appreciate a densely planted set up with plenty of driftwood and small caves. The most appropriate tankmates are other small, peaceful fish, particularly those who occupy higher levels in the tank such as some of the smaller characins or rasboras. Although generally very peaceable, N. anomala will become quite aggressive towards tankmates when breeding. For this reason it is best to avoid slow species which occupy the lower reaches of the tank where these fish spend a lot of their time. Wherever possible, try to keep one male and several females together; multiple males should not be kept together unless the tank is extremely spacious and contains numerous visual barriers amongst the decor. When more than one male is kept in larger quarters, the dominant male will grow largest and display the brightest colours, the subdominant male taking on the appearance of a female in order to avoid aggression from the dominant male. If the dominant male was removed from the tank, the subdominant male would then develop into the alpha fish. Filtration should be efficient but the water flow not too powerful. Wild caught fish are sometimes available, but the vast majority of N. anomala seen for sale in the trade will have been captive bred in Europe or Singapore.

Up to 300 eggs will be laid/fertilised, after which the female takes sole responsibility for guarding the clutch and at this time she can become very aggressive. In some cases the male may defend the larger territory from intruders, particularly in a community type setting, but in smaller quarters do observe carefully and move the male to another aquarium if the female starts attacking him. The eggs usually hatch within 2-3 days depending on water temperature, and the female will frequently move the fry to shallow depressions made in the sand, until they are free swimming (typically another 5-7 days).",

They're one of the world's most popular pets and that does have some drawbacks for them, as they don't always get the treatment they deserve. A sociable species, goldfish should be kept in groups but these can consist of a mixture of similar varieties - just make sure that female fish aren't outnumbered by the more long-finned and lightly-built males, which chase them relentlessly during spawning. \nGoldfish are a great choice for the garden pond. Hardy and long-lived, they'll happily live amongst pond plants and don't place too much of a burden on filtration, even as mature fish. When kept alongside varieties such as shubunkin and sarasa comets they'll freely interbreed, with fry showing dark colouration that protects them from predators until they grow large enough to look after themselves.\nIn their long history as pets, it's become common practice to keep goldfish indoors in containers that are much too small for them. As you can imagine, housing a 30cm pond fish in a bowl is not ideal and a suitable indoor aquarium should be at least 100 litres in capacity and well-filtered for young specimens. Far better alternatives are available for indoor keeping and tropical fish are far easier and a good deal less work. If your heart is set on goldfish as a pet, consider starting with small fish in a large aquarium which can then be upgraded to a spacious pond as they grow \" obviously, this is only an option with pond-hardy varieties. Kept properly, these fish should live for decades, with the current record standing at 43 years. \nGoldfish are hardy and adaptable fishes, but they prefer hard water whether indoors or out and soft, acidic conditions are to be avoided. To minimise the stresses of cold winter weather and hot summer days, a fishpond should be at least 60cm (2\") deep in places. During the coldest weather, this area should remain undisturbed by vigorous water circulation and will be used as a refuge from extreme cold.\nGoldfish have been bred into a great variety of shapes and colours and these are generally split into two categories - Fancy forms with modified body shapes and single-tailed forms. Fancy goldfish are less hardy and are considered aquarium fish, whereas their more fish-shaped kin are generally regarded as pond fish. You'll find more detailed profiles on the databank that go into the care requirements of each. In terms of the classic orange pond goldfish, short-finned fish are referred to as common goldfish and long-finned are known as comets. It's best not to mix fancy and single-tailed forms.",

        "breeding": "At temperatures of 15c and above, male goldfish will start to pursue females in a spawning chase, driving them into suitable egg laying sites. Mature goldfish will breed on a regular basis in established ponds so do make occasional checks to ensure that the pond is not becoming overstocked. In larger ponds, keeping fish that will consume the goldfish eggs - such as orfe - is a natural way of keeping the population in check. Goldfish lay their eggs amongst aquatic vegetation (or on artificial spawning mops) and these usually hatch within 48-72 hours depending on water temperature. Young goldfish are brown in colour (like their ancestors) and it can take up to a year before brighter colouration becomes apparent. Some fish will remain the bronze colour of their wild ancestors and enjoy the benefits of being harder for predators such as herons to see.",

Ideally, try to provide a dark sand substrate and plenty of shady hiding spots amongst driftwood, caves, and dense planting. Floating plants can also be used to help diffuse the light. Peat filtration and the addition of Indian Almond Leaves (Terminalia catappa) would be very beneficial in helping to create and maintain the favoured conditions.

In general, N. aureocephalus are very peaceful, and can be kept with other small peaceable species. However, a word of caution: the female can become extremely aggressive when breeding; this is something to be aware of as such behaviour can cause problems if they are housed as part of a community. Such issues are less likely to arise in larger tanks with an abundance of visual barriers amongst the d\u00c3\u00a9cor. It is usually advisable to keep just one male and one female together.

The semi-adhesive eggs will then be deposited onto plants, decor, or the sides of the aquarium etc and the process repeated. The eggs generally take around 5-6 days to hatch, and after a further few days the fry will become free-swimming and are able to take finely-powdered first foods and newly hatched brineshrimp. To avoid predation and ensure a higher success rate, many fishkeepers move the parents to another aquarium after the eggs have all been deposited. If younger males happen to engage in the act of spawning, it is quite likely that a number of eggs will go unfertilised. In this instance be sure to remove the unfertilised eggs from the aquarium as soon as possible, as they will quickly attract fungus, which could spread to the healthy eggs.",

        "care": "The Granulosus Catfish is endemic to Lake Tanganyika, where it is most abundant at depths between 20-40m (66-131ft). It is less abundant in the lake than other Synos and more likely to be seen singly than more sociable relatives such as Syno. multipunctatus.\nThis is one of the most eye-catching species of Synodontis with its dark grey body and thick, bright white edging to all fins (except the adipose) and white barbels. Juveniles may appear a lighter brownish-grey and typically display dark spotting on the flanks, but the contrast diminishes with age to a point where the spotting is no longer visible. The aquarium should be spacious with a soft sandy substrate in order to protect the sensory barbels. It should be decorated with a good amount of driftwood, rocky caves/PVC tubes, and robust planting (that can cope with hard, alkaline conditions) to provide shady areas, but you should also ensure that a roomy swimming space is left along the front of the tank. Efficient filtration is recommended, as these fish are voracious eaters and can produce a fair amount of waste. The water should be well-oxygenated with a moderate current, and frequent partial water changes are a must to help keep nitrate to a minimum. These fish are most comfortable in aquaria with subdued lighting, although this is less of an issue for tank-bred fish that are used to aquarium conditions. Ensure that heaters are covered with heater guards to prevent these catfish from being burned when looking for dark crevices to rest against. Syno. granulosus is territorially aggressive towards conspecifics, so a spacious set up is needed to keep adults together. Companions should be relatively peaceful and they do well as part of a Tanganyikan community of medium-sized fish.\nThanks to its scarcity in the lake, this was at one time a rare and expensive collector's catfish with a price tag of around \u00c2\u00a3750. Captive breeding has changed this and brought them within the range of most enthusiasts. May also be seen on sale as the White Seam Synodontis and like other Tanganyikan species, hybrids may be seen with creative names.",

The body is an elongated, but chubby, torpedo shape that is dark olive dorsally, fading to a silvery brown on the flanks with a white belly and large outlined scales. In ideal conditions, Grass Carp can grow alarmingly quickly, consuming up to three times their own body weight of freshwater vegetation daily, and as such, require an extremely voluminous home from the outset. Adults can live for around 20 years and have been known to attain 1.5m (60\") in length and a whopping 45kg in weight in the wild, so these are not suitable fish for small ponds. Given their appetite for aquatic plants and potential size, these fish are best reserved for large koi ponds or features where planting is not a priority. When other options are limited, they'll happily eat blanketweed and duckweed. Grass carp can be quite nervous and readily jump to avoid dangers, either real or imagined. This is less of a problem when housed in large ponds.\nAs well as the dark wild form, an albino strain is available which combines high visibility with more modest adult size.",

In the wild, Grass Carp consume an extensive range of plants including - but not limited to - species from the following genera: Acorus, Azolla, Butomus, Calamagrostis, Calla, Carex, Ceratophyllum, Chara, Egeria, Eichhornia, Elodea, Equisetum, Fontinalis, Hydrilla, Hydrocharis, Juncus, Lemna, Lysimachia, Myriophyllum, Najas, Nasturtium, Nitella, Nuphar, Nymphaea, Phragmites, Pistia, Polygonum, Potamogeton, Ranunculus, Sagittaria, Scirpus, Spirodela, Stratiotes, Trapa, Typha, Utricularia, Vallisneria, and Zizania, in addition to filamentous algae (Chladophora spp.).",

Provide plenty of rockwork and create numerous shady caves for the fish to hide amongst. Try to ensure that the strongest areas of current flow through these hiding places, as this would be where these fish reside in their natural environment. Bogwood is not strictly necessary, although it may make the tank look more aesthetically pleasing. Larger specimens will uproot plants, so if these are desired, opt for robust species such as Anubias or Java Fern as these can be attached to the decor.

Ensure that the fish have been rested after import and that they are feeding well before purchase, as they can sometimes be a little sensitive to the shipping process. The body color and size/distribution of the spots can vary depending on collection location; the darker forms have been collected from the northern part of the range, with the fish becoming progressively lighter as the river wends its way south. At the very northernmost part of the range, this species appears to be displaced by the Blue Phantom Plec L128. To add to the confusion, another Green Phantom Plec (Baryancistrusdemantoides), which is also known as L200, is found at the confluence ofthe Rio Orinoco and Rio Ventuari. H.subviridis lacks a connective membranous tissue between the dorsal and adipose fins, whilst the dorsal and adipose are connected in B. demantoides.

There is some debate as to whether this species is best maintained in fresh, brackish or marine water, and we believe that brackish conditions result in healthier, longer-lived Green Spotted Puffers.

If keeping more than one Green Spotted Pufferfish, ensure that all fish are of the same size and that they are introduced simultaneously \"\u201c newcomers to an established group are not normally welcomed. Although pufferfish personalities are often very variable, in general Green Spotted Puffers are somewhat aggressive (becoming more belligerent as they mature), so do observe carefully. This species grows to a good size and requires a roomy tank; when confined to quarters that are too small, forceful biting will occur amongst the group. As with other puffer species, these fish can inflate when frightened or cornered. They should never be provoked into doing so, and never above water where they can take on air, which can prove fatal. If moving Green Spotted Puffer/s to larger quarters, the fish should be herded into a solid container under the water so as to remove the necessity of netting and lifting them clear of the water.

        "care": "The Green Tiger Loach is known from a variety of habitats including lakes, rivers, and upland streams. During the rainy season, when water depth/flow increases and the water temperature drops, they migrate into flooded areas to spawn, usually staying close to submerged trees/logs/roots or under the structures of stilted river houses. The waterways are usually lined with riparian vegetation, and the substrate is comprised of rounded gravel, water-worn cobbles, and small boulders, creating an endless labyrinth of effective hiding places. In some areas there will be fast current as water is forced past haphazard rockwork. As with all botiids, these loaches must only be added to aquariums that are biologically mature. However, unlike their close relatives, the Botia spp., the pointy-faced Syncrossus genus of loaches grow larger and are exceptionally aggressive and territorial. It is essential that a spacious aquarium is provided, and numerous hiding spots and \"\u02dcvisual barriers\"\u2122 created with driftwood, smooth rounded rocks, cobbles, and pebbles of varying sizes. Ensure that the substrate has no sharp edges as these loaches will enjoy digging around the bottom of the tank in their search for titbits of food, and it is important that nothing damages their delicate sensory barbels. Dim lighting is preferable, and a well-covered tank is a must as these loaches are expert jumpers and can escape through the smallest of openings. Powerful filtration (ideally provided by external canister/s) and a decent level of oxygenation are requisite, as are frequent partial water changes. Like other fish from riverine habitats, these loaches are intolerant of a build up of organic pollutants, so ensure that a regular partial water change schedule is in place. As mentioned above, Green Tiger Loaches are extremely hostile towards other fish, and in the confines of the home aquarium, this can include their own kind. However, despite the hostility, they do form fascinating highly complex social structures within a group, and their physical health will suffer if they don\"\u2122t have contact with more of their own species. To this end, they should always be maintained in large groups of 8 or more. This will not only meet their social needs but it will help spread any aggression amongst the shoal, so that no one fish bears the continual brunt of the antagonistic behaviour. It is also why adequate space and visual barriers are so important. Tankmates, if desired, must be chosen with much care - only large, robust, fast-swimming species that can hold their own should be considered (large but placid species, even if larger than the loaches, will be mercilessly bullied). Some aquarists like to keep more than one species of Syncrossus loach together; this usually works well, but do make sure there are several of each species and not just single specimens. In addition to the tiger loaches, some of the Yasuhikotakia species of loach also cohabit well with Syncrossus due to their similar belligerent behaviour and environmental needs. The Green Tiger Loach is sometimes confused with the similar looking Banded Tiger Loach (S. helodes). They can be told apart by the presence of a dark blotch on the dorsal fin in S. hymenophysa (absent in S. helodes). S. helodes also sports a series of small dark spots on the lower half of the flanks, whereas S. hymenophysa has none. S. hymenophysa is adorned with 12-15 vertical bars with green iridescent borders, and S. helodes displays 10-12 vertical bars without green iridescent borders.",

The water in the native habitat is very soft and acidic, and stained a tea colour from the tannins in the decaying leaves and wood.\nThe home aquarium should be mature, with a dark substrate and background and with plenty of plant cover - both rooted and floating - in order for these peaceful mid-to-top-dwelling fish to feel secure. Filtration should be efficient but water movement gentle. These fish are best maintained in groups of at least 10, and more than this wherever possible. Dominant males may occasionally bicker with one other, but providing there is a good network of hiding places/visual barriers for them to retreat into if necessary, no harm should ensue. Keeping more females than males will also help to reduce any minor aggression-related problems. In the wild, these fish are found alongside many other small characins, including representatives from the Axelrodia, Carnegiella, Copella, Hemigrammus, Moenkhausia, and Tyttocharax genera, along with the congener Nannostomus marginatus (the Dwarf Pencilfish). Dwarf cichlids from the Apistogramma and Mikrogeophagus genera could also be considered as good tankmates, as well as Corydoras catfish and small loricariids. Choose companions wisely as Pencilfish can be fairly timid and will hide away and refuse to feed if tankmates are too boisterous. If unfussy about creating an exact biotope, some of the smaller Rasbora and Boraras species from Asia would get along well with the pencilfish, as would Kuhli loaches (Pangio spp.). As with other Nannostomus species, N. marilynae assume a cryptic colour overnight so may look a little pale when the lights first switch on. Acclimatisation should be carried out very carefully, and be sure to keep up with small regular water changes to keep nitrogenous wastes at a minimum.

One or more pairs of well-conditioned adults should then be carefully acclimatised across. When ready to spawn, and whilst swimming alongside one another, the male will nudge the female's abdomen. The eggs will be laid/fertilised a few at a time, and these should fall into the mass of plants or down into the safety of the marbles. This will continue until up the female is spent of eggs (eggs can number up to 100 per mature female), and the parents, being voracious egg-eaters, should be removed immediately. It should be noted that some aquarists find breeding is more successful with a single pair, rather than a group, as the smaller number of adult fish present will mean less chance of predation. The eggs should hatch after 36-72 hours (temperature dependent) with the miniscule fry using up their yolk sacs and becoming free-swimming around 3-4 days later.

Once inseminated, the female will gestate for approximately 20 days, after which time she will give birth to between 5 and 60 young. A single mating will father broods for a number of months, meaning that further contact with a male is not needed for months. This factor makes line breeding more tricky, as females must be separated from males as soon as the sexes are discernible to ensure the right pairings take place. Parents will attempt to eat their young but if kept in a planted aquarium, plenty of fry usually manage to survive on to adulthood. Guppies are relatively short-lived but usually leave a lot of descendents.",

        "care": "The curious Hairy Pufferfish is known from the vast Mekong River and its tributaries. Here it is found in rocky habitats amongst swiftly flowing, highly oxygenated waters, where it is habitually observed nestled tightly in between crevices in the rocks on the substrate, ready to ambush any small fish or crustaceans that venture past. The Hairy Puffer requires a good sized, mature aquarium with a soft, sandy substrate and plenty of rocky caves and crevices to hide between. As these fish are voracious eaters and can create a fair amount of waste, decent filtration should be employed (an external canister is ideal). There should be areas of moderate water movement and a high level of oxygenation, perhaps achieved by a powerhead with flow diverter angled up towards the surface of the water, or by keeping a slightly dropped water line so that water returning from  the filter splashes down onto  the water's surface. Hairy Puffers are belligerent, territorial fish, and generally, should only be kept singly in a species-only aquarium. On occasion, however, compatible mated pairs are available, and this is the only circumstance in which two can be kept together. Even so, do observe very carefully and be ready to separate them if the need arises. If two incompatible fish are placed together, much aggression will ensue, with the fish inflicting serious bite wounds on one another with their beak-like mouths, which can end up being deadly. The same outcome will await any other fish species in the confines of the same aquarium, so never house Hairy Puffers with tankmates. In the case of being fortunate enough to maintain a compatible pair, do ensure that there are plenty of visual barriers amongst the rockwork and driftwood, should the fish need to spend time apart and out of the line of sight of the other. Robust plants are also safe with these fish, and can be used to create additional hiding places. As with other puffer species, this fish can inflate when frightened or cornered. It should never be provoked into doing so, and never above water where it can take on air, which can prove fatal. If moving a Hairy Puffer to larger quarters, the fish should be herded into a solid container under the water so as to remove the necessity of netting and lifting it clear of the water. Hairy Puffers are capable of fairly dramatic colour change, depending on their surroundings or mood. It is thought that mature male fish display a greater number of cirri on the body, compared to females of a similar size and age. Interestingly, juveniles of less than 3cm (1.2\") SL exhibit no cirri at all. As a scaleless species, be aware that these fish are very sensitive to medications. Lastly, please remember that pufferfish can vary in temperament, and there may be exceptions to the expected behaviour of the species - even a pair that has been deemed 'compatible'. It is always a good idea to have some sort of tank divider - or even a spare aquarium - handy, should circumstances necessitate their use. Hairy Puffers are intolerant of poor water quality - as already mentioned above, make use of a decent filtration system and perform plenty of regular partial water changes.",

        "care": "The Hairy Snail is endemic to freshwater and brackish habitats on the island of Bohol in the Philippines. These unusual-looking gastropods, with delicate, rear-facing, needle-like protrusions on the shell, are found in shallow river waters (typically 1-3m) and estuaries that undergo tidal influence. These are fairly active, but largely nocturnal snails that will roam quite widely in their search for food. When at rest, they usually bury themselves into a soft substrate, so a layer of fine aquatic sand on the bottom of the aquarium is preferable to gravel, as it will protect the fragile periostracum spikes. These snails are great for planted community aquaria, where no predatory fish are present (i.e. loaches, pufferfish, large cichlids etc) and are fairly efficient algae grazers. Robust, fast-growing plants are normally perfectly safe (well-fed snails by and large only browsing on dead or decaying plant matter) and they usually only turn to eating healthy aquatic plants if other food sources are scarce. The water should be moderately hard and alkaline to allow for healthy shell development. In softer water, where the calcium concentration will be lower, the snails will be very prone deterioration of the shell. It is best to maintain a water line slightly lower than is usual (about the same gap as the height of the largest snail will be sufficient) to allow them to move in and out of the water if they choose. However, do ensure that the coverslides are kept tightly shut and any small gaps plugged, as these snails are excellent escape artists. Tankmates should be peaceful and enjoy the same water conditions e.g small tetras, rainbowfish, honey gouramis, guppies/Endler's livebearers, Caridina/Neocaridina shrimps etc. Ensure that the tank is well filtered and that regular partial water changes are carried out, at the same time vacuuming the substrate to ensure that the mulm that can accumulate from the snail\"\u2122s waste products is removed. In the wild, Hairy Snails inhabit waters with a moderate flow, so do ensure that there are areas of good water movement within their aquarium. The only downside with these beautiful snails is that they are unable to breed in freshwater conditions - although this may actually be a blessing to some as they will not over-populate the tank in the same way some 'pest' snail species can. Be very careful when handling these snails as the long, thin spines can pierce the skin. Never use treatments containing copper when snails are present.

Offer a variety of foodstuffs, including spirulina-based foods, algae wafers, sinking pellets and slices of vegetables, plus occasional offerings of small meaty items.

This provides an ongoing source of natural greenfoods.",

Indian Almond Leaves (Terminalia catappa) are very much appreciated as 'leaf litter', and will help to simulate blackwater conditions, but they must be replaced regularly. The footprint (length and width) of the tank is much more important than the height. Lighting should be diffused with the use of floating plants, and it is also a good idea to use a blue moon light timed to come on just before the main lights go out, so that you can view the antics of these nocturnal creatures under their preferred dimly lit conditions. Although they tend to stay buried for much of the day with just their snouts protruding from the cover, they do become very active at night. Be sure that the aquarium has no gaps at the top, as these fish are great escape artists. Half Banded Spiny Eels are not aggressive, but adults are capable of taking small fish overnight, so tankmates must be chosen with care. Neon Tetra sized fish, for example, are not recommended.

The parents should be removed as soon as spawning has ceased, otherwise they will predate on the eggs. The eggs are light-sensitive, so it is important that the sides of the tank are covered in order to keep the tank in darkness and prevent the eggs from fungussing. After 24 hours, the eggs will hatch, and after a further 72 hours, the wrigglers will become free-swimming. The tiny fry will require very small foods, starting with infusoria, and gradually moving on to bigger foodstuffs as they grow. Small frequent partial water changes should be carried out with much care as the fry are incredibly sensitive to changes.

This species is also, unfortunately, most antisocial and should be kept as a solitary specimen. Never try and house more than one in the same aquarium, or with similar-looking species/other bottom-dwellers. The temperament of each individual does tend to vary from fish to fish, but on the whole, they can be extremely territorial and very troublesome towards other species, even those considerably larger than themselves and which you may have thought previously could hold their own. If, however, despite its unfriendly disposition, you would like to keep a Harlequin Shark, do ensure that it has a spacious aquarium in which to roam (6ft x 2ft x 2ft would be considered a minimum) with good filtration and a powerful flow rate. As a river-dwelling species, it will swim against the current in obvious enjoyment. Lighting should be fairly bright in order to encourage algal growth, which this species will graze upon with its fleshy mouth. The substrate should consist of fine sand or rounded gravel in order to protect this delicate mouth and sensory barbels. Sharp decor such as lava rock must be avoided. Darkened areas can be constructed out of bogwood and rocks, ideally providing the fish with many different territories to choose from. Plants can be included, although they should be of a robust nature to withstand the grazing behaviour of the Harlequin Shark. Many aquarists have had better success housing their Harlequin Shark with fast medium-sized robust tetras, barbs or danios rather than larger slower fish and similar bottom-dwellers, which usually succumb to relentless bullying. Due to the intensely territorial nature of this species, it is best to add this fish to the tank as the last specimen. It will persecute any newcomers to its environment.

These streamlined bottom-dwellers inhabit highly-oxygenated torrential waters in hillstreams and river rapids, and have a special thoracic adhesive apparatus (folded pleats of skin along the underside of the body) which allow them to maintain position and feed in strong currents. This specialised rheophilic habitat must be replicated in the home aquarium if Hillstream Catfish are to thrive. Extra powerheads (in addition to the return flow from filters) can be used to create a river type effect; the surface of the water should be visibly moving to ensure that there is a high amount of oxygenation within the water at all times. An additional air-pump is also a handy back-up (but should not be relied upon as the sole means of oxygenation, as it is not enough). Without such a combination of cooler-than-average water temperature and high level of oxygenation, these catfish will not fare well. It is important to provide a soft sand substrate in order to protect the impressive but delicate sensory barbels, and be sure to make a good number of shady hiding places available such as slate caves, driftwood, and PVC pipes for these nocturnal fish to take refuge in during the day - as they do not enjoy bright lighting. Glyptothorax spp. are peaceful and can be kept in groups, but do provide several shady refuges per fish. Adding a blue moon light to your aquarium (which switches on just before the main lights go out) will allow you to spend time observing them under their preferred subdued lighting. Adding some suitable \"dither fish\" to the aquarium may also encourage them to venture out a little more during the daytime, and some of the medium sized species from the barb, Barilius, Danio, and Rasbora families make great companions, as do balitorid hillstream loaches. Plants can be incorporated into this type of specialist aquarium, but not all species will cope well with fast current. Having said this, many aquarists have had a good deal of success with Anubias species, Java moss (Taxiphyllum barbieri), Java fern (Microsorum sp.) and some species of Cryptocoryne. Plants are not found in great abundance in the natural habitat of the Hillstream Catfishes, so are not considered essential, but they will help with water quality and will make the aquarium look more aesthetically pleasing.

Hillstream Loaches have evolved to live in extremely fast-flowing waters, where they use their pectoral and pelvic fins to form a \"suction cup\" in order to hang on to smooth rocks amongst rapids.

Without such a high level of oxygenation and water movement, Hillstream Loaches will not fare well at all, and for these reasons, these fish are totally unsuitable for keeping alongside goldfish, which will not appreciate the same conditions. Hillstream Loaches should only be added to aquariums that are biologically mature. Such tanks will have a good established growth of algae for the fish to graze upon in order to consume the micro-organisms within, and will provide a source of nourishment whilst the fish may be adapting to the taking of prepared foods. The front glass can be wiped free of algae, but it is recommended that you allow algae to freely colonise the sides and back glass, and over the decor. Lighting should be bright in order to encourage a decent amount of algal growth. Ideally, the aquarium will be at least 36\" long, and contain a multitude of hiding spots amongst rocks, cobbles and bogwood. Flat smooth rocks should be placed in the path of the flow, where these fish will often congregate. Plants can be incorporated into the Hillstream Loach aquarium, but not all species will fare well under the extreme flow conditions.

Plants are not found in the natural habitat of Hillstream Loaches, so are not considered essential, but they will help with water quality and will make the aquarium look more aesthetically pleasing. Hillstream Loaches deserve a specialist aquarium to meet their needs. Their quirky behaviour is something totally out of the ordinary and is a joy to observe. They can be kept alongside other sub-tropical current-loving species such as White Cloud Mountain Minnows and many species from the Danio family.",
        "feeding": "Although these fish will graze upon the natural algae within the aquarium for the small micro-organisms it may contain, the diet must be supplemented with small frozen foods such as mosquito larvae, daphnia, brineshrimp etc. Many specimens will also adapt to taking dried foods such as sinking catfish pellets and algae wafers, although frozen foods tend to be preferred. Will also enjoy cucumber, blanched spinach and kale etc.",
        "breeding": "Most species have not yet been bred in the home aquarium; however, a few hillstream loach enthusiasts have had success in breeding one species in particular: Pseudogastromyzon cheni. There is often an elaborate courtship display where the male will be seen \"dancing\" around his chosen female, until she \"accepts\" him and starts to follow him about. The male positions himself on top of a flat rock or cobble and slides backwards off of it, at the same time swishing his tail, in order to dig a small pit within the substrate. The female then follows in a similar manner and deposits her eggs into the pit, which the male fertilises. He then covers up the eggs with some of the substrate. Youngsters can be expected to rise out of the substrate in approximately 2 weeks and will start to graze on the surfaces in the aquarium for micro-organisms. The adult Hillstream Loaches will not harm the tiny fry, although other fish species within the aquarium may show an interest.",

        "care": "The Hippo Point salmon cichlid is named after the region of Lake Victoria where it was first discovered, where it inhabits muddy and sandy areas feeding on snails. Like all of the endemic cichlids from this lake, wild populations were almost driven to extinction by the introduction of the highly predatory Nile perch (Lates niloticus) and aquarium populations are important to their continued survival.\nThe aquarium should be spacious and aquascaped with rocky outcrops which break the sightline and enable territorial fishes to avoid one another. These structures should be built with the purpose of creating many crevices for the fish to explore but constructed in such a way so as to keep the rocks stable if the fish start to dig around and underneath them. Filtration should be efficient, with moderate water flow and a good level of oxygenation. Regular partial water changes will help keep nitrate to a minimum. This seems to be one of the more assertive Victorian cichlids and should be kept in groups, ideally with 2 or more females to every male. Suitable tankmates could include some of the more easy going mbuna or peacocks from Lake Malawi, but do research individual species thoroughly to ensure compatibility.",
        "feeding": "A good quality flake or granular food should be supplemented with a variety of frozen foods such as bloodworm, white mosquito larvae, daphnia, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, and Mysis shrimp. Live foods are eagerly accepted. Although snails feature heavily in their diet in the wild, they don't seem to be an important part of their diet in captivity.",
        "breeding": "This species is easily bred in the home aquarium. When ready to spawn, the colouration of the male will intensify and his aggression level will heighten. He will choose and clean a spawning site, then display to the female fish until one accepts him. He can be rather aggressive in pursuit of a female, so spawning should always be attempted in a harem situation where the male is outnumbered by females and aggression is dispersed amongst the group. When a female is receptive, the pair will circle each other in a head to tail manner a number of times, until the female deposits her eggs. These are deposited just one or two at a time and after doing so, she immediately turns around and picks them up. At the same time, the male will rotate so that he is almost on his side, at the same time shaking and extending his anal fin, releasing his milt. The female sees the egg spots on the male's anal fin and attempts to pick up those dummy eggs whilst she is picking up the real ones that she deposited, and at the same time taking in milt. This is the method of fertilisation, and this ritual may go on for some time until the female is spent of eggs. She will incubate the eggs in her mouth for up to 3 weeks before releasing free-swimming fry, which can immediately be offered baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and crushed flake food.",

        "care": "The Hockeystick Pencilfish is a small shoaling species known from tributaries, backwaters, and swamplands, where the water is sluggish or almost still, and crowded with dense vegetation and an abundance of leaf litter. The water in the native habitat is very soft and acidic, and stained a tea colour from the tannins in the decaying leaves and wood.\nThe home aquarium should be mature, with a dark substrate and background and with plenty of plant cover - both rooted and floating - in order for these peaceful mid-to-top-dwelling fish to feel secure. Filtration should be efficient but water movement gentle. These fish are best maintained in groups of at least 10, and more than this wherever possible. Dominant males may occasionally bicker with one other, but providing there is a good network of hiding places/visual barriers for them to retreat into if necessary, no harm should ensue. Keeping more females than males will also help to reduce any minor aggression-related problems. In the wild, these fish are found alongside many other small characins, including representatives from the Copella, Hemigrammus, Hyphessobrycon, and Paracheirodon genera. Dwarf cichlids from the Apistogramma or Mikrogeophagus genera could also be considered as good tankmates, as well as Corydoras catfish and small loricariids. Choose companions wisely as Hockeystick Pencilfish can be fairly timid and will hide away and refuse to feed if tankmates are too boisterous. If unfussy about creating an exact biotope, some of the smaller Rasbora and Boraras species from Asia would get along well with the pencilfish, as would Kuhli loaches (Pangio spp.). As with other Nannostomus species, N. eques assume a cryptic colour overnight so may look a little pale when the lights first switch on. This species also swims in an oblique position with tail slightly down and head angled towards the water's surface, a trait that, amongst congeners, is shared only by N. unifasciatus (the One-lined Pencilfish). Acclimatisation should be carried out very carefully, and be sure to keep up with small regular water changes to keep nitrogenous wastes at a minimum. Tight fitting coverslides are a must, as these fish are capable of jumping from an open topped aquarium.\nThis species is often imported in mixed batches alongside the One-lined pencil (N. unifasciatus) which is pictured here for comparison. May also be known as the Knight pencilfish.",

        "breeding": "This species has been bred in the home aquarium, although it is challenging and reports are few and far between; this would make an excellent breeding project for the dedicated hobbyist. A separate softwater breeding aquarium should be set up (peat filtration recommended as the water should ideally have a pH below 6) with plenty of fine-leaved plants, a substrate of marbles, subdued lighting, and gentle air-driven filtration. One or more pairs of well-conditioned adults should then be carefully acclimatised across. When ready to spawn, and whilst swimming alongside one another, the male will nudge the female's abdomen. The eggs will be laid/fertilised a few at a time, and these should fall into the mass of plants or down into the safety of the marbles. This will continue until up the female is spent of eggs, and the parents, being voracious egg-eaters, should be removed immediately. It should be noted that some aquarists find breeding is more successful with a single pair, rather than a group, as the smaller number of adult fish present will mean less chance of predation. The eggs should hatch after 24-36 hours (temperature dependent) with the miniscule fry using up their yolk sacs and becoming free-swimming around 5-6 days later. Feed on infusoria, rotifers, and powdered first foods to begin with, moving on to larger foods such as microworm and Artemia nauplii as they grow.",

Plenty of shady planted areas should be provided, but as this is a species that loves to dig, attaching plants such as Anubias and Java Fern to bogwood can be more successful than planting into the substrate. Also include some rocky caves and pieces of driftwood to give the fish additional cover. Corydoradinae species have the ability to breathe air intestinally, so a small gap should be left between the surface of the water and the cover slides in order for the fish to come up to the surface and take air in; it may do this numerous times per day. As these fish grow relatively large, a deeper than average tank (18\" or so) will be appreciated. Ensure the aquarium has tight fitting coverslides as Hog-nosed Brochis are capable of jumping. Good filtration and frequent partial water changes are a must for this species, as they can be rather sensitive to elevated nitrate levels. Ideal companions could include angelfish, dwarf cichlids, tetras, or medium-large peaceful loach species. Handle these fish with care as the sizeable pectoral and dorsal spines can easily become tangled in netting. These fish are usually imported at a length of 5cm or larger, and they do tend to command a relatively high price tag - something to bear in mind as a good sized shoal is required for the wellbeing of these sociable fish. Brochis species can be distinguished from Osteogaster and Corydoras species by the presence of more dorsal fin rays (10 or more in Brochis species, fewer in Corydoras). Brochis multiradiatus differs from the other species of Brochis by its pronounced \"hog-like\" snout and larger number of dorsal fin rays.\n\nBrochis was a synonym of Corydoras for a time, but taxonomic work saw the genus revalidated.

Here they inhabit rivers and streams with gravelly substrate and moderate to strong current. The aquarium should be large enough to allow any tankmates to escape the potential breeding territory of a single pair, with a much more spacious tank required for multiple specimens. There should be plenty of hiding places amongst driftwood and rocky caves, and flower pots laid on their side are also much appreciated. If plants are desired, choose tough species such as Java Fern (Microsorum sp.) or Anubias sp. tied onto the wood, as plants rooted in the substrate will be dug up. Filtration should be efficient with areas of moderate water movement, along with some quieter resting spots out of the current. Although clearly close to Convicts, 'HRPs' are considerably less aggressive and can usually be maintained as a compatible pair as long as suitable target fishes are present to give them a common enemy. Companions can include shoaling fishes such as Buenos Aires tetras and livebearers such as Swordtails and Goodeids, other cichlids should be of similar size and temperament but avoid keeping this fish alongside close relatives such as other Amatitlania or Cryptoheros, to avoid hybridisation.\nA gold form of this fish has been produced, which may have arisen through crosses with the pink strain of Convict. It maintains the iridescence seen in normally coloured fish and this also seems to be a feature of the short-bodied hybrid traded as the Polar parrot cichlid. Away from the obvious hybrids, you may see this fish labelled as HRP or Blue Convict.",

Whilst the female is busy cleaning the spawning site, the male patrols the perimeter, ready to defend against any intruders that may, or may not, be present. When ready, the female will swim over the spawning site in a series of dry runs, after which she will begin depositing eggs. The male immediately follows behind her and fertilises them. The act of spawning has been known to continue for well over an hour in some cases, after which time, the female will start hovering above the eggs, fanning them with her pectoral fins. The male resumes his sentry duty, guarding the perimeter once more. If kept in a larger mixed community type setting, other fish usually cotton-on pretty quickly that it's best to stay well away from the protective parents and this prevents the pair taking out their protective urges on one another. After 3 or 4 days, the eggs should hatch into wrigglers, and the parents will move them into one of their prepared pits. The wrigglers will initially feed on their yolk sacs, and should become free swimming after another 4 or 5 more days. Baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii), microworms, or egg layer first foods should be offered at this stage, followed by crushed flake after a week or so.

        "care": "In the wild, these benthic loaches are known from swiftly flowing, highly oxygenated riverine environments. The channels are often lined with solid bedrock, rounded gravel, cobbles, and small boulders, creating an endless labyrinth of effective hiding places and areas of extreme flow as water is forced past haphazard rockwork. The natural habitat should be emulated as closely as possible in the home aquarium by employing powerful filtration and using additional powerheads to create strong currents and to oxygenate the water efficiently. Depending on your location, a means of chilling the water may be needed during the warmest parts of the year. As with all botiids, these loaches must only be added to aquariums that are biologically mature. Create a multitude of hiding spots and \"visual barriers\" with smooth rounded rocks, cobbles, and pebbles of varying sizes. Ensure that the substrate has no sharp edges as these loaches will enjoy digging around the bottom of the tank in their search for titbits of food, and it is important that nothing damages their delicate sensory barbels. Dim lighting is preferable, and a well-covered tank is a must as these loaches are expert jumpers and can escape through the tiniest of openings. Tankmates should be chosen with care, as most Leptobotia tend to grow to a reasonable size and have capacious mouths - other temperate botiids, some of the torpedo-shaped nemacheilid loaches, Crossocheilus spp., Garra spp., and some of the medium sized Devario or barb species would all make good companions. As with all botiids, L. taeniops fares best with company of its own kind; 3 specimens should be considered the absolute minimum housed together, with 5 or more being much healthier. This peaceful species is not commonly seen in the trade and tends to command a fairly high price, so be prepared to budget for a good sized group. This will allow these fish to form a complex social hierarchy and behave naturally within a shoal. Unfortunately, much of the natural habitat of L. taeniops has been despoiled by man. Along the Yangtze River, damming activity and pollution have inevitably taken their tolls and it is thought that spawning grounds have been adversely affected in some areas. Colouration and pattern varies immensely within this species and no two fish look quite the same. As L. taeniops has quite a wide distribution area, there are resultant geographic differences; some specimens are predominantly black with a bluish sheen, others display more of a mottled to heavily reticulated purpley-brown pattern, both pink and xanthic specimens have occasionally been seen, and there are some which display spectacular dorsal surfaces that are almost luminous yellow.",

Juveniles are known to dwell in smaller streams and oxbow lakes.\nThis species grows to a substantial size and will require a spacious, mature aquarium with soft, acidic water. Provide plenty of shady retreats amongst bogwood and sturdy rocky caves, ensuring all decor is secure as larger specimens can be a little clumsy at times. The water should be very well-filtered (adult fish produce a substantial amount of waste) and a moderate current/good level of oxygenation should be created by extra powerheads in order to simulate their natural riverine conditions. Ensure regular partial water changes are carried out to help keep nitrogenous wastes to a minimum. This species is generally peaceful, although it can be rather territorial with its own kind and similar species. More than one specimen may be kept in the same tank if it is spacious and multiple hiding places/visual barriers are provided. The Honeycomb Plec mixes well with medium sized characins, some of the more robust Corydoras catfish species, and many rheophilic cichlids.\nDepending on various factors, including mood, sex, age, or surroundings, these fish are capable of quite considerable colour change. There is also a degree of geographical variance between specimens from different collection locations. H. faveolus differs from all other species of the genus Hypostomus by having a unique combination of pale blotches over a darker background in body and fins, and conspicuous keels on the head, predorsal region and lateral plates. The species name \"faveolus\" is derived from the Latin favus, meaning honeycomb, in reference to the reticulated colour pattern formed by the pale blotches within thin dark limits. May also be seen on sale as Faveolus Plec.",

        "breeding": "This species has been bred in the home aquarium, but details are few and far between. It is thought that the low incidence of breeding success could be due to the relative scarceness of this fish in the trade, and also because many aquarists keep single specimens. Like the majority of other Hypostomus species, this is a cave spawner, with the male providing paternal care. The juvenile fish develop the distinctive mesh pattern fairly early on. If you have a mature male-female pair, provide them with a choice of several caves that are  just slightly longer than the fish, but not excessively wide (clay drainage pipes blocked off at one end with slate can work well). It is possible that well-conditioned fish could then be triggered into spawning by carrying out a 30% water change with slightly cooler water.",

        "care": "Hoplo Catfish are excellent bottom-dwellers for larger tanks with medium-sized tankmates. Because they attain quite a size, they must not be kept with small fish of Neon Tetra proportions as these will be eaten overnight when the Hoplo is at its most active. This species is best maintained in groups of 5 or more. In the wild they are said to congregate in their thousands, such is their sociable nature. The fish must be carefully observed for any pairing and spawning (see below), as the male in question will become aggressive and fish may need to be moved to other quarters. Juveniles may be housed in a 4ft long aquarium, but adults require more space. There should be a soft sand substrate which will be kinder on the long sensory barbels and plenty of shady hiding places amongst bogwood, rocks and robust planting. Hoplo Catfish do like to dig, so be sure that structures are secure. Lighting should not be too bright, or else should be diffused with floating plant species. The use of a blue moon light tube is highly recommended for viewing this nocturnal species in the late evening time. Despite their supposed tolerance of less-than-ideal conditions in the wild, this is not an excuse to let things slip within the aquarium. A good maintenance and water change regime is a must, and we find that these fish thrive in high O2 conditions with plenty of current. Typical tankmates could include medium sized members of the barb (Puntius) family, large Rainbowfish species, large Devario species, medium sized or deep bodied Tetra species e.g. Congo Tetras, Black Widow Tetras etc, medium-large sized Rasbora species, Severum cichlids, and more. Bear in mind that Hoplo Catfish are very boisterous at feeding times, so be sure to feed at several locations within the tank simultaneously so that the other fish get their share. Nervous species may be reluctant to feed when the Hoplo Catfish launch themselves into a frenzied food searching mode, so observe carefully. Hoplo Catfish have the ability to breathe air intestinally, so a small gap should be left between the surface of the water and the cover slides in order for the fish to come up to the surface and take air in. They may do this numerous times per day. May also be seen on sale as the Port Hoplo Catfish.\n  As well as the dark brown wild form, an albino is available.",

        "breeding": "Hoplo Catfish form a strong pair bond. At the first signs of spawning, when the fish seem to have paired off and the male is displaying a purpley-blue belly, it would be best to move any other Hoplos to another aquarium, leaving just the male-female pair. (The female may well also need to be moved away from the male later on). A calm area should be created within the aquarium, which does not show turbulence at the surface. This is the likely site where the male will choose to construct his bubble nest. Usually triggered by a cool partial water change, he will build this nest at the waters surface, anchoring it to floating plants (a small piece of polystyrene has been known to act as a good substitute). In order to stabilise the nest further, the male cuts pieces of plant from elsewhere in the tank and adds them to the nest. He is able to do this with the use of his sharp pectoral fins, and this process may take several days. When the nest is ready, the male will pursue the female and if she accepts him they will swim up to the bubble nest and adopt the T-position (also seen with Corydoras spawnings). The female deposits her adhesive eggs (a small number at a time) into the nest which the male fertilises. This action is repeated until the female is depleted of eggs. The number of eggs will depend on the size of the female but expect upwards of 150. A good sized female will produce 500+. The male then begins furiously guarding the nest against any predators (which will include nets and hands!), and it is at this point the female must be removed for her own safety; male Hoplos have been known to kill their mate in their over-zealous defending of the eggs. The male will make any necessary repairs to the nest as and when required, retrieving any eggs that fall, and these can be expected to hatch after 72-96 hours. Once the eggs begin to hatch, it is wise to catch the male and relocate him to another tank as he may start to predate on the fry. The fry will initially take nutrition from their yolk sacs, but should be offered tiny foods, such as microworms, after 24 hours or so.",

        "care": "The Hornet Tilapia is a large-growing and very aggressive cichlid species that is known from deep, rocky West African waters. Their natural diet of small snails means that adults require a good-sized feeding territory and this intolerance of conspecifics is also found in tank-bred specimens. Juvenile fish can be housed together, but adults are much more belligerent and do not tend to mix well with others. To house one of these fish, a very spacious aquarium is required. A group of youngsters may be grown on together, but they will soon require separating into single specimens or compatible pairs (aggression usually becomes apparent once the fish attain 2\" or so) and rehoming into larger quarters before serious problems arise. Putting a male fish and a female fish together at a later date does not mean they will be compatible, in fact, it is quite unlikely to work - it is best to let the fish grow up together and pair up naturally. Hornet Tilapia will display darker markings when maintained over a dark-coloured substrate, and large specimens tend to show a bit of a yellow tinge to the white bars. Large-sized gravels/pebbles should be avoided as bigger specimens are capable of throwing it against the glass; it is best to choose the smallest-sized gravel available. These fish like to dig and rearrange the d\u00c3\u00a9cor, so ensure that any large structures are stable, and definitely make use of a heater guard. These fish are big eaters, so an efficient filtration system along with regular water changes is very important in order to keep them healthy. Anything green and leafy will be regarded as a tasty snack, so if plants are desired they will have to be plastic and well-weighted down or secured to the decor. With regards to tankmates, large non-territorial shoaling fishes are the best choice in aquaria large enough for them to keep out of harm's way. It may be possible to house a Hornet Tilapia with other cichlids of a similar size and temperament in a huge tank with plenty of visual barriers amongst the decor but more often than not, these fish do best on their own. If you are fortunate enough to obtain a compatible pair, it is best to house them in a species-only tank, as extreme aggression would be shown towards outsiders if breeding occurs in an aquarium containing other fish - and this could all too quickly result in fatalities. And always have a sturdy tank divider to hand, in case they start to behave too pugnaciously towards one another. Materials such as egg crates (popular with coral propagators) can be used and holes provided to allow the smaller female easy access to her own area where the male can't follow. Although there are a number of important rules to adhere to when maintaining these fish, kept under the right conditions the Hornet Tilapia makes for a great pet fish; it is not a bit shy, and quickly learns to recognize its owner.",

Clutch sizes are large, as in the wild the fry are relentlessly preyed upon and this ensures that some survive to adulthood. If you have a compatible pair and they decide to breed, be prepared to move the male to other quarters once the eggs have been laid/fertilised, as the adults can become exceptionally nasty towards each other.

These cryptic bottom dwellers form large, loose aggregations and spend much time hidden beneath the substrate, usually with just their long noses and high-set eyes peering out. Due to their burrowing and sand-sifting nature, it is vital that the home aquarium has a substrate of fine, soft aquatic sand, since gravel - even fine grade - makes these natural activities very difficult. When startled, these curious-looking members of the Cobitidae family immerse themselves into the sand with lightning speed. It is therefore important to provide these large-growing loaches with as much space as possible (a 4ft long tank should be the absolute minimum for smaller specimens) in order to prevent them from damaging themselves when diving in. It is thought that the Horsefaced Loach secretes extra slime coat to facilitate such effortless movement beneath the substrate. The water should be clean and well-oxygenated, with 10-15% water changes being carried out twice a week. Like most river-dwelling loaches, a decent flow rate in the aquarium will be very much appreciated. A few choice pieces of driftwood, smooth pebbles/cobbles and areas of planting with robust, broad leaved plants can be used to create some welcome shady hiding places, but be careful to place all decor on the tank bottom (so that it cannot be undermined) and try not to restrict the open areas of sand too much, leaving some large expanses for these fish to explore from below. Leaf litter (e.g. from dried Indian almond leaves) could also be used in some of the calmer regions of the aquarium to give the tank a more natural feel. Ensure the tank has tight fitting coverslides and be sure to block any holes where equipment feeds into the tank with coarse filter foam, as these fish are expert jumpers. Blue moon lighting in the evening should allow you to see more of these nocturnal beauties.

        "care": "The Humpback Puffer is an ambush predator which is best maintained in a species-only aquarium. In very spacious aquaria, they can sometimes be kept with some large armoured catfish species or other puffer species (similar in temperament and size), but do observe very carefully. They are not suitable for keeping with small fish as these will quickly become a snack. It is best to either keep a single Humpback Puffer specimen or else a group of 5 or more, rather than just 2 or 3. This will help to spread any aggression amongst the group. Due to the large adult size and territorial nature of the Humpback Puffer, they should be maintained in spacious aquaria with plenty of shady hiding spots/visual barriers amongst rocky caves (allow more than one cave per fish). Lighting should not be too bright, and the substrate should be smooth because of the puffers will spend the majority of their time laying on it almost motionless. However, they soon learn when it is time for feeding and will venture out in a very eager fashion when the keeper approaches the tank. When keeping multiple specimens, it is best to distribute the food as evenly around the tank as possible, so that there is less chance of the puffers accidentally biting each other when lunging for a morsel of food. Once feeding time is over, the puffers tend to retreat once more to a resting position in their chosen territory. Occasional territorial arguments will inevitably occur, and when this happens, the two puffers concerned will horizontally flatten their bodies and lower their heads, swimming around each other in a circle in an attempt to see the other one off. Biting may occur, but this is a rare occurrence and is not usually too serious, particularly if tip-top water quality is maintained. If a group is to be kept, it is best to introduce them simultaneously to avoid any newcomers being set upon. As with other puffer species, this fish can inflate when frightened or cornered. It should never be provoked into doing so, and never above water where it can take on air, which can prove fatal. If moving a Humpback Puffer to larger quarters, the fish should be herded into a solid container under the water so as to remove the necessity of netting and lifting it clear of the water. Please remember that pufferfish can vary in temperament, and there may be exceptions to the expected behaviour of the species. It is always a good idea to have some sort of tank divider - or even a spare aquarium - handy, should circumstances necessitate their use. Intolerant of poor water quality - make use of a decent filtration system and perform plenty of regular partial water changes. May also be seen on sale as the Palembang Puffer.",

        "breeding": "These fish have been spawned in captivity, although rearing the fry can be problematic. It is best to purchase a group of 5 or more fish and observe for any natural pairing. Following an elaborate courtship ritual, which includes inflation by both male and female, the pair will choose a cave site in which to spawn and a pit will be created. Little is known about the actual egg laying & fertilisation, but all brood care is carried out by the male. The eggs are said to hatch within 6-7 days, and after a further 48 hours, the fry will be free-swimming. The fry, much like the parents, will not actively seek out food, but will instead wait for it to flow past them, when they will snatch it up. They can be started on newly-hatched brineshrimp and moved on to larger foodstuffs such as cyclops and daphnia as they grow. Unfortunately, there can be a large number of casualties as there tends to be much aggression between the youngsters.",

Ideally, try to provide a dark sand substrate and plenty of shady hiding spots amongst driftwood, caves, and dense planting. Floating plants can also be used to help diffuse the light. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement fairly gentle, and frequent partial water changes should be carried out on a regular basis to keep nitrate at a minimum.

        "care": "Although only fairly recently described, the Humphead Glassfish - with its most distinctive cranial hump - has quickly become one of the most familiar and popular members of the family Ambassidae (Asiatic Glassfishes). In the wild, it has been found to inhabit large streams with clear, highly-oxygenated waters near to rapids and large riffles. The home aquarium should be spacious enough for this moderately sized, active swimmer, and should employ good filtration and areas of powerful current. Highly oxygenated water is an absolute must. The tank could be decorated with driftwood and smooth water worn boulders, cobbles, and pebbles to create eddies and some areas of slightly calmer water. It is important to create some visual barriers amongst the d\u00c3\u00a9cor, as on occasion, males can be a little argumentative and territorial with one another; this should not become an issue if large enough groups are maintained (8+) and if they are provided with enough space and places to hide in the first place. Tankmates should be of similar size, as anything small (i.e. Guppy sized) would become a snack. In their native habitats, Humphead Glassfish will maintain their position in the strong current, waiting for small fish, shrimp, insects etc to be swept along and these are quickly snapped up into their surprisingly capacious mouths. Good choices of tankmates could include medium-sized barbs, medium-sized characins, botiid loaches, and Loricariid catfish. Ensure that frequent partial water changes are carried out, as these fish are especially sensitive to the build up of nitrogenous wastes in a closed system. It may be of interest that the scale-less hump is actually a very long and thin extension of the supraoccipital spine, and is therefore quite different to the nuchal hump seen in some cichlids.",
        "feeding": "Initially, Humphead Glassfish may be a little fussy with regards to feeding. Start by offering live and frozen meaty items such as bloodworm, white mosquito larvae, Mysis shrimp, river shrimp, chopped prawns etc. In time these fish may adapt to taking some dried foods such as flake and granules, but be prepared with a choice of small frozen/live foods as detailed here, during the initial settling in period.",
        "breeding": "The Humphead Glassfish has not been bred in the home aquarium. Like other Glassfish species, it is an egg scatterer and it is quite probable that it would breed in a similar manner. A large water change in the evening may initiate spawning of well-conditioned fish the following morning, when the first rays of morning sun hit the aquarium glass. There should be plenty of plants/spawning mops to catch the eggs as they are scattered/fertilised. The adults will likely predate on any eggs, so they should be removed once spawning is over. Glassfish eggs are notoriously sensitive and prone to fungussing, and some fishkeepers like to dose the breeding aquarium with a weak solution of methylene blue to help prevent this.",

        "care": "These colourful Peacocks are aquarium produced hybrids. The exact origins are not very clear but they are believed to be a cross between an Aulonocara species and possibly a Haplochromine, and the resultant offspring then crossed again with an orange-blotched Mbuna. Line-breeding to encourage the temperament and body shape of Aulonocara then gives us fishes that maximise colour but minimise aggression. Some variation can be seen in many batches of these fishes which indicates their mixed ancestry.\nThe aquarium should be at least 4ft long and aquascaped with open expanses of sand in addition to a few rocky areas. Decor such as ocean rock can be used to build sturdy structures which stretch from the base of the tank to near the surface of the water. These structures should be built with the purpose of creating many crevices for the fish to explore but constructed in such a way so as to keep the rocks stable if the fish start to dig around and underneath them. Although a substrate of coral sand or Aragonite is often recommended to help to keep the water hard and alkaline, Peacocks feel safer and show better colours over a darker substrate. The Aragonite or coral sand can always be placed into a mesh bag and kept inside the external filter for buffering purposes. Crossing with mbuna to introduce the OB gene has increased aggression levels compared to Aulonocara, but this is a relatively peaceful fish as far as Malawi cichlids are concerned. Whilst it may be tempting to add more of the colourful males than females to your setup, this will result in increased territorial disputes and stress. A better combination, although requiring a large aquarium, would be one or three males with a larger group (5+) of females. This species can be kept successfully alongside midwater Haps such as Copadichromis, Cyrtocara, Placidochromis etc and some of the more easygoing Mbuna (such as Labidochromis caeruleus).

They will circle each other in a head to tail manner a number of times, until the female deposits her eggs. These are deposited just one or two at a time and after doing so, she immediately turns around and picks them up. At the same time, the male will rotate so that he is almost on his side, at the same time shaking and extending his anal fin, releasing his milt. The female sees the egg spots on the male's anal fin and attempts to pick up those dummy eggs whilst she is picking up the real ones that she deposited, and at the same time taking in milt. This is the method of fertilisation, and this ritual may go on for some hours. The eggs may be incubated for around 3 weeks until they hatch and the resultant fry held for a further few days afterwards.",

The temperature should be set at the high end of the preferred range and the water must be extremely well-filtered and highly oxygenated. Provide a selection of small caves which have an entrance only marginally bigger than the fish \" these can either be formed from arranging the rockwork in such a way that small secluded crevices are created, or pre-constructed from small pieces of slate siliconed together. It is crucial that these caves are situated in an area with decent water movement. When in spawning condition, males will choose a preferred cave and defend it from any other males present, whilst at the same time, will try to entice a ripe female inside. Spawning does not always take place straight away, indeed it can be some days before the female is ready to deposit her eggs, but the fish will remain inside the cave together during this time, the male usually blocks the entrance. Once the eggs have been laid and fertilised, the male fish often has to force the female out of the cave before he begins his parental guarding duties. The female plays no further part in brood care, but the male will be seen fanning the eggs with his pectoral fins and blocking the cave entrance from any intruders. Eggs typically number around 20-30 and take around a week to hatch. The fry will feed from their sizeable yolk sacs for the first few days, and after this has been consumed, they will require very regular feedings of baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii), microworms, and various small or crushed dried sinking foods. It is important that food is available to the fry at all times as they can all too easily starve, but keep a very close eye on water quality when feeding constantly, and perform lots of very regular but very small partial changes to keep nitrogenous waste levels as low as possible. The adult Yellow Zebra Plecs pose no threat to the fry, but other fish sharing the same tank might do. This is why many aquarists like to keep these catfish in a species-only set up, to further their chances of raising the maximum number of young.",

        "breeding": "Some Corydoras can be challenging to breed and are often prompted by cues that are absent in the average set up. Mature pairs may be triggered into spawning by performing a large, slightly cooler water change. The pair will adopt the classic \u2018T position\u2019 where the male fertilises the eggs that are held between the female\u2019s pelvic fins. The adhesive eggs will then be deposited onto plants, d\u00e9cor, or the sides of the aquarium etc and the process repeated. The eggs generally take 4-5 days to hatch after which time the tiny fry should be offered finely powdered first foods. A few days later they will be able to take newly hatched brineshrimp. To avoid predation and ensure a higher success rate, many fishkeepers move the parents to another aquarium after the eggs have all been deposited.",

        "care": "The Imperial Flower Loach is a very special member of the Cobitidae family of loaches. It has long been revered as the \"Holy Grail\" of loach keeping, due to its unique gargantuan size, undeniable beauty, and scarcity in the ornamental fish trade. These giants of the loach world require enormous aquaria, with correspondingly powerful filtration to deal with the large amounts of nitrogenous wastes produced. A high level of oxygenation is absolutely essential to their wellbeing; powerheads that create a vigorous stream effect are ideal, especially when angled slightly upwards to create a churning effect at the water's surface. Juvenile fish grow quickly and require enough space so as not to become stunted and later suffer health problems. The fast-flowing subtropical waters in the native range of L.elongata are naturally hard and alkaline, with smooth water-worn gravel/pebbles as a substrate. There are significant seasonal fluctuations in temperature from around 5 \u00b0C during the winter to approximately 29 \u00b0C in summer. However, prolonged exposure to either extreme is not recommended, and for best long-term care in the home aquarium, try to maintain the tank water between 15-22 \u00b0C. In most centrally heated British homes, room temperature will be ideal and a heater set at around 18 \u00b0C would be necessary only to stop any drastic overnight temperature fluctuations during winter time. L. elongata does not appreciate bright lighting and should be kept under subdued illumination. Provide plenty of shady hiding places such as large PVC tubes, and caves built from smooth cobbles/small boulders/slate or sizeable pieces of driftwood, and here they will spend most of the day resting. Crepuscular by nature (most active at dusk and dawn), L. elongata is a gregarious species that must be housed in groups; five fish being considered the absolute minimum in order that they may form a pecking order. Keeping alone specimens would be considered cruel as these cobitids depend so much company of their own kind, this behaviour is often only truly appreciated when sizeable shoals are maintained together. Tankmates (if desired) must be chosen with much care, as although L. elongatais not an aggressive species, it is predatory by nature, restricting the aquarist somewhat in his/her choices. Mature specimens will eat any fish that are small enough to be sucked into their capacious mouths. The body colour of these beautiful loaches varies from a golden yellow to light greyish-brown, with 5-8 bands/blotches of dark brown. As the fish mature, the elongated, serpentine body shape develops into a much wider, stockier form. The background colour of the fish tends to become more gold and the caudal fin turns an intense red. Once the fish reaches 20cm or so, the dark bars tend to \"breakup\", with the fish taking on a much more marbled appearance. These rosettes of colour have lent themselves perfectly to the common name of Imperial FlowerLoach. Some sources also refer to these fish as Royal Clown Loach. Sadly, it would seem that in recent times the larger breeding adults are not as commonly encountered in the wild as they once were. This is not due to exports for the aquatic trade, as these have always been very few and far between, and of fish smaller than 15cm/6\". Instead, the severe drop in numbers is due partly to overfishing for the food industry (although L.elongata is not fished for specifically or considered a particular delicacy, larger specimens are often a by-catch and are destined for the same as the other fish that are caught); and also from hydro-electric damming activity along the tributaries of the Yangtze River, which has had the resultant effect of the species being no longer able to migrate to their preferred spawning grounds. Regrettably, pollution also plays its part in some areas. There are reports of captive breeding of L. elongata via hormone treatment, but this has not yet taken off on a large scale, most probably because the species is not an esteemed food fish, nor is it a fish suited to the average community aquarium. The Chinese government supposedly recognises that this is a species of special concern, yet they are not actively protecting it, and even now it is still waiting to be evaluated for IUCN red list status. This is despite catches and sightings being down some 80% on what they were 10 years ago with specimens over 25cm now rarely encountered. With such a blase attitude from the government, L. elongata needs aquaculture and dedicated aquarists to come to its aid quickly. If you can provide these fish with all the special requirements mentioned here, they will not disappoint!",
        "feeding": "Carnivorous. Small specimens prefer bloodworms, white mosquito larvae, chopped prawns, Mysis shrimp etc. Larger specimens are reported to feed on small catfish, loaches and shrimp in the wild, so offer large prawns, chopped lancefish/smelt etc. There is no call to offer live fish as part of the diet as not only is it considered unethical, but it also brings with it the potential risk of disease being introduced to the aquarium, plus there is often little nutritional value to be gained. Larger specimens have remarkable appetites, hence the need for oversized filtration and regular partial water changes. Be aware that L .elongata often shun pellet/dried foods and will hold out for meatier fare. Feeding a diet that is rich in carotenoids (such as is found in many crustaceans) will help to intensify their beautiful colours.",

Filtration should be efficient, but water movement gentle, and frequent partial water changes should be carried out in order to keep nitrate at a minimum. A. baenschi are generally peaceful, but can become rather territorial when breeding. Keep either a single pair, or in larger aquaria, one male with several females (which will form a harem). The females will seek out individual territories, hence the importance of many visual barriers within the tank. Good tankmates include Corydoras catfish, hatchetfish, pencilfish, small tetras, and suckermouth catfish. Like many of the Apistogramma species, A. baenschi will not tolerate an elevated nitrate level. Regular partial water changes are an absolute must for their continued wellbeing.

Eggs will be laid on the ceiling of the cave or pot, and these will be guarded by the female. The male fish will guard the general harem territory. The eggs should hatch after 2 to 4 days, depending on water temperature. The female continues guarding the wrigglers, and after a further few days, will lead the fry out of the cave. She will be very pugnacious at this point, fending off any would-be predators. The fry will require frequent small feeds with appropriately sized foodstuffs at this point, such as baby brineshrimp. If the spawning has occurred in a general community tank, it is a good idea to feed the other fish their food at the opposite end of the aquarium at the same time, to avoid undue stress to the female, who will be desperately trying to guard her young. Sometimes the female will take the fry up in her mouth and move them to another area of the tank.",

Few details are known about the natural habitat, other than it occurs in clearwater streams and rivers with mixed sand and gravel substrate. The aquarium should be biologically mature, and we would suggest a soft sand substrate and plenty of hiding places/visual barriers created using driftwood, rocky caves, pieces of slate, and robust planting such as Java Fern or Anubias sp. tied to the decor. Filtration should be efficient but water movement not too vigorous, and small frequent water changes will help keep nitrate to a minimum. Although Inca Stone Cichlids are relatively peaceful (except during spawning), they are not suitable for placing into a general community tank with small fish. However, they are loosely gregarious and should be kept in groups of 8 or more for their continued wellbeing. There may be minor territorial quarrels between males, but no real damage should ensue, particularly if there are plenty of visual barriers amongst the decor. Tankmates should be of a similar size and not overly aggressive. When breeding, Inca Stone Cichlids like to be able to deposit eggs on a moveable surface, such as leaf litter or small chippings of slate or wood, which they can pick up and reposition to keep the eggs out of harm's way. To this end, it would be considerate to add some dried Indian Almond leaves (Terminalia catappa) or small slices of slate that have been chipped from a larger piece (make sure the edges are not sharp) so that they can behave naturally. The scientific nomenclature is interesting, even though it is something of a tongue twister. The genus name is derived from the indigenous Quechua people's word for the Incan Empire - Tahuantinsuyo, and the species name translates to 'stone fish'.",

The male immediately follows behind her and fertilises them, and this is repeated until the female is spent of eggs. Both parents guard the eggs, and once hatched, the larvae are taken up into the mouths of both the female and male, who share in incubating the young for a further week or so until they are free-swimming.

It is one of several dwarf spineless eels from the family Chaudhuriidae, closely related to the swamp and spiny eels that are so appreciated by oddball aquarists. In all, 6 genera of dwarf spineless eels are currently recognized, and all are found in Asian freshwater habitats. These flexible little critters also go by the name of Earthworm Eel on account of their similar appearance to that of the garden worm. With regards to identification, neither the dorsal fin or anal fin has spines - hence the common name. In this genus (as well as that of Nagaichthys), the dorsal and anal fins have fused with that of the caudal, creating in effect one extremely long fin that wraps around the posterior of the fish. In the other 4 genera (Bihunichthys, Chaudhuria,Chendol, and Garo), the caudal fin is small but separate. The sole representative of Nagaichthys, N. filipes, attains a maximum total length of just 31mm, whereas the subject of this article reaches around 80mm. The Pillaia genus comprises just 2species, P. indica from the SouthGaro Hills region of India, and P.kachinica, which is known from the Irrawaddy River near Myitkyina, northern Myanmar. In the wild, Indian Dwarf Spineless Eels are always found in small colonies (average 10-12 fish) under an abundance of leaf litter that lines high-altitude, clear swampy pools, bogs, and sluggish streams. The substrate is silty and vegetation (both submerged and floating) is dense. Large specimens are sometimes observed protruding from small socket-like holes in driftwood all by themselves; possibly dominant males who have secured themselves the best available hiding places. These dwarf spineless eels make fabulous aquarium inhabitants and their relatively small adult size means that they may be kept in smaller quarters than that required by their larger, spiny cousins. This will undoubtedly appeal to lovers of oddball fish who do not currently have space for a sizeable aquarium. Ideally, the tank should be furnished with a soft sand substrate in order to protect these \"scale-less\" fish from damaging themselves on sharp stones when foraging for food or when burying themselves (which they may do from time to time). Rounded, water-worn cobbles may be used along with small pieces of driftwood to further decorate the aquarium. Dense planting will be much appreciated by these shybottom-dwellers. In the wild, they tend to avoid bright light, so a network of shady hiding places is a must. Filtration should be effective but gentle, and regular small partial water changes are a must in order to keep nitrogenous wastes to a minimum. Dried Indian almond leaves (Terminalia catappa) could also be used to create a very natural leaf-strewn biotope, but these will require periodical replacement as they disintegrate. Always keep these little eels in good-sized groups and only with tankmates that are of similar size and temperament, and who enjoy the same conditions. P. indica is listed as endangered on the IUCN red list due to the threat of deforestation in the surrounding areas, which has the knock-on effect of causing extreme siltation within the streams.",

Here, these nocturnal predators are found in muddy brackish estuaries and marine waters, only migrating into freshwater to spawn. Unfortunately, because this species is sometimes found in freshwater during the breeding season, it has been marketed erroneously in the trade for many years as the \"Freshwater Moray Eel\", when actually it requires brackish or full marine conditions long-term, as it's visits to freshwaters are only very temporary. This large bottom-dweller requires a spacious aquarium with a soft sand substrate in which it can forage about for food and wallow. There should be a multitude of hiding places amongst rocky caves, pvc tubes, and salt-tolerant plants. Filtration should be efficient with areas of moderate water movement, and some quieter resting areas out of the current. Frequent partial water changes are essential to keep nitrate to a minimum. Be sure to use a quality marine salt for water changes, and monitor salinity carefully with a hydrometer. Indian Mud Moray Eels are highly predatory, feeding on fish (even fairly large ones) in the wild. However, they may be kept in groups of their own kind in spacious aquaria, if all specimens are of roughly the same size, are added simultaneously, and are provided with at least one shelter each. We do not recommend housing with other fish species, as the eels will strike at them and most will soon be eaten. Although their eyesight is rather poor, Indian Mud Moray eels have a keen sense of smell and can detect movement vibrations very well, quickly lunging at any potential prey. This includes the hands, so much care should be taken when carrying out maintenance on the aquarium - they are capable of giving a nasty bite! As with other moray eels, these fish have needle-like teeth and possess a second set of teeth in the throat, known as the pharyngeal jaws which assist in capturing and swallowing prey. Although this species is not highly venomous, it does have a mildly toxic mucus coating to the mouth which can cause skin irritation if bitten. Ensure that the tank has tight fitting coverslides as these fish are accomplished escape artists. Kept under ideal conditions, the Indian Mud Moray Eel has been known to live in excess of 30 years; they will not survive for long in pure freshwater.",

In its native heavily vegetated habitats, the Indonesian Leaf Fish lurks among fallen foliage and other aquatic debris in order to ambush unsuspecting passing prey; any small-sized fish that swim too near are quickly ensnared. This behaviour continues in the home aquarium, and is why this captivating Pristolepid is best maintained in a species-only tank. This is not only because of its predatory nature towards small fish, but also because it tends to become bullied by larger more aggressive species. Indonesian Leaf Fish are not particularly belligerent themselves if adequate numbers are kept and suitable space/visual barriers are given, but their predatory habits and nocturnal activity spells a very real danger for standard community fish. In the wild, as you may expect, this species is found in a variety of different habitats, the waters of which are all relatively slow-moving with an abundance of aquatic vegetation. Therefore the aquarium housing Indonesian Leaf Fish should be densely planted with plenty of tall trailing plants, plus floating varieties, for them to lurk amongst. They will also appreciate other shady areas assembled from bogwood pieces and rocky caves. Ideally, the tank will be at least 4ft long because these fish are fast growers and will quickly attain a large adult size. Small partial water changes should be carried out on a regular basis as these fish will not fare well if subjected to high levels of nitrate. Indonesian Leaf Fish should be maintained in a group of 5 or more individuals. Groups smaller than 5 are rarely successful and we do not recommend this be attempted. When keeping a larger group, all individuals MUST be introduced at the same time to prevent unnecessary territorial arguments that would otherwise be aimed at any newcomers. Any specimens added to the group at a later date could be caused so much stress by the long-term residents, that they do not make it through the acclimatization period. Some aquarists claim to have had success in housing these fish alongside Synodontis catfish, Port Hoplo Catfish, larger members of the Loricariidae family (Suckermouth cats), and larger Rainbowfish species, but you are guaranteed to see these fish at their best in a species-only planted aquarium.",

Firstly the tank should be biologically mature and must contain an abundance of bogwood, as this forms an essential part of the diet (these fish can actually be heard rasping their way around the aquarium!). There should be plenty of sheltered retreats created from the bogwood as well as from smooth rockwork, so that these nocturnal catfish feel comfortable during the day. They do not enjoy overly bright illumination, so ensure that there are many shady areas formed by driftwood, caves, and even floating plants, which will help to diffuse the light. Robust plants such as Anubias and Java Fern could be included (tied to the wood for best results) but avoid soft-leaved or delicate plants as these will be uprooted or eaten. Excellent water conditions should be maintained at all times via the use of a powerful filtration system that can cope with the amount of wood waste. A good current and high level of oxygenation will serve the fish well, and may even tempt them into breeding. Panaqolus are generally very peaceable, but males will squabble with one another over territory, so if planning on maintaining more than one specimen, ensure the tank is spacious and furnished with enough visual barriers and caves to keep everyone happy. These catfish are peaceful towards other types of fish and should only be kept alongside small quiet species e.g. small tetras, hatchet fish, pencilfish, rainbowfish, Corydoras catfish etc.",

The aquarium should be at least 5ft long and furnished with a soft sand substrate, as these cichlids like to dig. Provide hiding places/visual barriers in the form of driftwood tangles and rocky caves, ensuring that the decor cannot be easily undermined. Robust plants such as Anubias sp. or Java Fern may be cultivated on pieces of wood, providing additional shady spots. Filtration should be efficient with areas of moderate water movement, and some calmer resting areas out of the current. These fish are susceptible to deteriorating water conditions, so small but frequent water changes are a must to help keep nitrate to a minimum. Perhaps, unsurprisingly for a fish named after a heavyweight boxer, Jack Dempsey cichlids become territorially aggressive as they mature. If a pair forms, they will show much hostility towards conspecifics and similar species, and unless the tank is particularly voluminous with a plethora of visual barriers, other fish may need re-homing for their own safety. In spacious quarters, these cichlids can usually be kept alongside tankmates that are too large to be viewed as a snack e.g. large armoured catfish, silver dollars, Tinfoil barbs etc. Always observe carefully and have a means of separating your fish should it become necessary. From a young age, sexing these fish is made easier thanks to a difference in facial colouring - females carry blue markings on their cheeks, whereas the usually larger males are unmarked. \nAn electric blue colour variant is sometimes available, but it's exact origins are unclear.

This is a robust, bulky species which does attain a large size. Just how large though, seems subject for debate, with sources citing 70cm (27.6\") for the largest specimen ever recorded, yet most aquarists and ichthyologists agree on 15-30cm (5.9-11.8\") being much more usual.

        "care": "The Jade-eye Cichlid is often described as \"the nicer Convict.\" Whilst they may look similar in appearance, the Jade-eye Cichlid is rather more attractive, and it also has a better temperament than its cantankerous cousin, the Convict (Amatitlania nigrofasciata). Distributed within the waterways of the Central American Atlantic slope, covering Belize, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, this species also has an established population in Hawaii where it was introduced back in the 1980s. They are reported to inhabit the shallow slower-moving waters of lakes and rivers, preferring areas close to the banks where rocky caves and tangles of wood/roots are abundant. This provides welcome shelter and protection for these relatively small cichlids (which attain a maximum length of 12cm) from larger predators. Jade-eye Cichlids, like many Central American fish, undergo many seasonal changes in water chemistry. As a result, they are not too finicky about their aquarium water parameters, providing that nitrates are kept low. Many Jade-eye Cichlid populations have been found living in conditions of soft-medium hardness (2-12dH) and of a neutral pH. However, most of the specimens offered for sale today are of tank-raised origin and are likely to have been acclimatised to the water chemistry in your area. Although these beautiful little cichlids are of a much better disposition than Convicts, they should still not be kept in an aquarium less than 3ft long, and even then this would only be suitable for one pair with no tankmates. Even in larger tanks you are likely to run into trouble if trying to house more than one pair together successfully, although in aquariums of 5ft+ you are more likely to be able to keep a pair of Jade-eye Cichlids in with a mixed community of robust medium-sized fishes, such as other Central American cichlids or large tetra species etc. Substrate can consist of either fine gravel or sand, or even a mixture of both for a more natural \"river\" effect. Numerous caves should be provided for shelter and for breeding purposes and these can be in the form of resin cave ornaments, \"home-made\" rock/slate caves, clay flowerpots etc. Any clay flowerpots should be new and clean, and if the \"orange\" look isn't too pleasing on the eye, you can coat the dry pots with aquarium safe silicon and roll in your chosen substrate, so that (after the specified drying time) they can be placed onto the substrate and appear more camouflaged against the sandy/gravely bottom. Bogwood or resin root ornaments can also be added to further recreate that river bank effect. Many geographical colour variants of the Jade-eye Cichlid exist in the wild. The Guatemalan Red-head, which as the name suggests, sports a reddish head, along with a partially red coloured dorsal fin. Some variants from the northern part of their range have an overall light green body colour with maroon heads and vertical bars. And much sought after is the Lago Izabal strain which has a yellow head, throat and underside, with a maroon dorsal fin and a bright blue-green anal fin. May also be seen on sale as Blue-eyed Cichlid or Spilurum.",

Wild specimens have been observed picking algae off of various surfaces, perhaps for the small invertebrate life it may contain.",
        "breeding": "Sexing Jade-eye Cichlids is a fairly easy task. Males are generally larger than females, with longer anal and dorsal fins. Mature males specimens also develop a small nuchal hump on their foreheads. Females of the species sport a dark metallic area in the dorsal fin, a trait that is thought to exist in most, if not all, Cryptoheros species. If all else fails and you are still not 100% confident with sexing a pair, a quick peek into your dealer's stock tank may well reveal all. More often than not, two of the fish will have paired off within the confines of the stock tank and adopted their high contrast breeding dress, leaving the others all anxiously huddled in the opposite top corner of the tank. The pair will be quite happily going about their business, and in some cases may even have fry in tow! Once you have obtained your pair and acclimatised them to their new surroundings, it is likely to be only a short period of time before they become \"in the mood.\" No special techniques are called for, and given that you provide them with good water conditions and the mixed diet mentioned earlier, the female should start to fill out with eggs. At this time, the pair will choose a preferred spawning site at one of the caves, digging small pits near the entrance. Whilst the female is busy cleaning the spawning site, the male patrols the perimeter, ready to defend against any intruders that may, or may not, be present. When ready, the female will swim over the spawning site in a series of \"dry runs\", after which she will begin depositing her 300-400 eggs. The male immediately follows behind her and fertilises them. The act of spawning has been known to continue for well over an hour in some cases, after which time, the female will start hovering above the eggs, fanning them with her pectoral fins. The male resumes his sentry duty, guarding the perimeter once more. It is at this time that Jade-eye Cichlids are at their most aggressive, which is why, if you have a pair in a relatively small aquarium, they are best kept by themselves. However, if kept in a larger \"mixed community\" type setting, other fish usually cotton-on pretty quickly that it's best to stay well away from the protective parents and this prevents the pair taking out their territorial aggression on one another. After 4 or 5 days, the eggs should hatch into wrigglers, and the parents will move them into one of their prepared pits. The wrigglers will initially feed on their yolk sacs, and should become free swimming after another 4 or 5 more days. Baby brineshrimp, microworms, or egg layer \"first foods\" should be offered at this stage, followed by crushed flake after a week or so. The parents will continue to herd them from pit to pit until they are ready to make their own way. Well fed adults do not usually prey on their young. With such a large potential brood size, you should think about methods of re-homing the young once they have attained a satisfactory size. Jade-eye Cichlids mature at what seems like a very young age, and before you know it, you could have multiple pairs trying to form.",

This highly patterned bottom-dweller is predatory and nocturnal, hiding away during the day and emerging at night to feed. It requires a spacious softwater aquarium with a sand substrate in order to protect the sensory barbels. There should be plenty of hiding places amongst driftwood, rocky caves, PVC pipes, and robust planting. The more hiding places that are provided, the more this shy catfish is likely to venture out and about, as it will get to know it has safe places to quickly retreat to if it feels the need. Dim lighting is preferred, but this can be brighter if it is diffused with broad leaved species or floating plants. A blue moon light timed to come on just before the main lights switch off will provide you with time in the evening to watch the nocturnal antics of this catfish under its preferred subdued conditions. Filtration should be efficient, with moderate water flow. Frequent partial water changes are essential to keep the nitrate level at a minimum. The Jaguar Catfish is generally peaceful although it will eat small fish overnight, so these must be avoided. Only if there is sufficient space and an abundance of visual barriers, should a group of these catfish be considered - and then they must be observed carefully. In most cases, they will behave territorially towards other fish that occupy the lower levels, so they should be the only bottom-dweller, and kept singly unless homed in vast quarters. If another fish ventures in to an occupied cave, the Jaguar Catfish will vigorously defend its hidey hole and even emit audible deep grunts. Large armoured catfish, sizeable South American cichlids, medium-large barbs, Distichodus spp., and adult silver dollars could all be considered good companions.

Sizeable pieces of driftwood and rocks/slate can be used to create sheltered areas, but these should be made secure as these cichlids are more than capable of moving d\u00c3\u00a9cor around. Bonding pieces of rock together with aquarium grade silicon sealant prior to filling the tank is sensible. Robust planting such as Anubias sp. and Java Fern cultivated on the wood (rooted plants will be dug up) can be used to create further shady hiding places. Partial water changes should be carried out on a frequent basis to help keep nitrate to a minimum. This is a highly aggressive species which is best maintained singly or as an established male-female pair. They are intolerant of their own kind, but can usually be combined with other robust cichlids, if the aquarium is particularly spacious and has a plethora of visual barriers. Tankmates could include other Central/South American cichlids of a similar size and temperament, or large armoured catfish. However, if breeding does occur, expect a huge amount of aggression directed towards the other fish and be prepared to move the tankmates to another aquarium for their own safety. Sometimes the male can be very persistent when wanting to breed, and if the female is not receptive, he may harm her. So always observe carefully and have a tank divider on hand, should the need arise to separate an overly amorous male from his female. Ensure the aquarium has a tight fitting hood that is weighted down, as these heavyset fish are expert jumpers. May also be seen on sale as the Aztec Cichlid, Jaguar Guapote, or Managuense Cichlid.",
        "feeding": "Offer a variety of meaty frozen foods. Smaller specimens will take white mosquito larvae, bloodworm, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, and Mysis shrimp, whilst larger fish will take krill, prawns, crayfish meat, lancefish, silversides, whitebait etc. Good quality and appropriately sized cichlid pellets should also be provided.",
        "breeding": "Prior to spawning, the pair will begin cleaning a potential spawning site, such as a flat piece of slate. Up to 6000 (six thousand) eggs will be laid/fertilised, and these can be expected to hatch within 72 hours. The parents will then move the wrigglers to a pre-dug pit. They will become free-swimming after a further few days when their yolk sacs are used up (at this point they can be offered baby brineshrimp or crushed flake). Parental care usually continues for around 6 weeks. Please be aware that a bonded pair may reproduce on a regular basis, and always in exceptionally large numbers. Therefore, it is important to consider whether you should really allow this species to reproduce in the home aquarium, and should have a homing plan in place for the potentially hundreds, if not thousands, of juvenile fish (that are going to attain a substantial size), which are going to quickly overwhelm an aquarium.",

        "care": "Jamaica is the third largest Caribbean island, with a land area of almost 11,000 sq km. Perhaps best known for its lush scenery and idyllic tropical beaches, it may come as a surprise to learn that Jamaica boasts some 120 rivers, which are home to almost 40 species of freshwater fish. Much of the island is composed of limestone, and the ridge of mountains, which form its backbone, top out at 2256m (7400ft) at Blue Mountain Peak in the east. The majority of the 120 rivers are relatively small, but fast-flowing, and run from the rugged central mountain ranges to the coasts with cascading waterfalls along the way. Most of these rivers are reported as being fairly un-navigable, and are also prone to flash flooding during the rainy season. Natural crystal-clear springs are also prevalent throughout the terrain, and it is amongst the shallower areas of these springs in the parishes of Manchester, St. Elizabeth, and Westmoreland that we find the Jamaican Killifish. Jamaican Killifish are one of only two members of the genus Cubanichthys, from the subfamily Cubanichthyinae. They are considered by many experienced Killifish keepers to be quite a challenging species to keep in the home aquarium, so are not recommended for beginners. The aquarium should be furnished with a soft sand substrate and be well planted. In the wild, this species tends to hide amongst shady areas of aquatic vegetation, booth rooted and floating. Lighting should not be too bright, with floating plants used to help diffuse it further. It is imperative that the water is maintained to a high standard at all times, with gentle movement provided by the filter. Compared to some species of Killifish, Jamaican Killifish are of mild temperament, and so groups including more than one male can be kept together. Occasionally males may try to intimidate each other, but no harm should ensue, particularly with a maze of plant cover for the recipient to retreat into and hide amongst. Females tend not to be quite as colourful as the males, and in fish of the same ages, females are slightly smaller. With a maximum size of just 6cm, the species is ideally suited to small planted set-ups. Jamaican Killifish really are best maintained in a species-only environment, and not as part of a general community setting. Jamaican Killifish are a non-annual species, which means that they will live longer than a year and do not need to reproduce within that timeframe in order for the species to survive. Breeding has been accomplished in the home aquarium (see below) but it is not easy.",
        "feeding": "These fish undoubtedly prefer small frozen or live foods such as mosquito larvae, daphnia & baby brineshrimp. Over time, some specimens may accept dried food, but not all will be willing.",
        "breeding": "A conditioned pair should be placed in their own spawning aquarium, which should contain live plants including Java moss and floating species. Jamaican Killifish are \"brood hiders\" or \"crevice spawners\" and as such, usually select a hidden spawning site, such as within a tangle of aquatic vegetation (this is where the Java moss comes in handy) or within the crevices of rocks and caves, for example. Some aquarists have even used chunks of open-cell filter foam as a spawning medium. The filamentous eggs, 1.2-1.4mm in diameter, are fertilised and injected into the chosen crevice. It can take from 9 days to 2 weeks until the eggs hatch (very dependent on temperature) and as the parents are non-guarders, they need to be removed from the aquarium once spawning has ceased, otherwise they will predate on the eggs. Upon hatching, the fry are quite sizeable, and are more than capable of taking baby brineshrimp and powdered egg layer first foods. As with the adults, excellent water quality is paramount in your success.",

        "care": "The Jewel Cichlid is known from shallow, quiet stretches of large rivers, oxbow lakes, and swampy habitats where there is an abundance of aquatic plants, both submerged and emergent. They are also known from slightly brackish waters in coastal lagoons.\nJewel Cichlids are highly territorial and must be kept in spacious aquaria (ideally minimum 4ft long) with plenty of visual barriers amongst the decor. Their antagonistic behaviour is not so much of an issue in the wild, where fish can easily move from one territory to another, but it can certainly present problems within the confines of the aquarium. Provide a sandy substrate along with plenty of nooks and crannies formed from pebbles, rocks, pieces of slate, flowerpots turned on their sides, and tangles of driftwood - ensuring that lines of sight are broken up. Areas of dense planting will be appreciated, but as this species likes to dig, it is best to stick to robust species that can be tied on and trained to grow on the decor, such as Anubias spp. and Java Fern (Microsorum spp.) plus floating varieties. Filtration should be efficient but water movement not too strong, and frequent partial water changes should be carried out to keep nitrate levels at a minimum. Jewel Cichlids are best maintained in pairs, but picking out a male and a female will not guarantee they are compatible, and the stronger fish may kill off the weaker individual. It is better to purchase a group of 6+ youngsters and allow a natural pair to form, before rehoming the others. Tankmates, if desired, must be chosen with care as Jewel Cichlids become highly aggressive when spawning, but good choices could include some of the larger African tetra species (Alestes, Arnoldichthys, Bathyaethiops, Phenacogrammus spp. etc) or Synodontis catfish. However, be aware it is very likely you will need to relocate the tankmates should the Jewel Cichlids start breeding. This is why many choose to keep these beautiful fish in a species tank environment.\nA few strains of this fish have been developed in aquaria and some have been confused with their rarer wild relatives. A form with dark males and bright scarlet females has been traded as lifallili for years, but bears little resemblance to the genuine wild fish, which is much more peaceful.

        "breeding": "Jewel Cichlids are pair-bonded substrate spawners. The water should be neutral to slightly soft and acidic with the temperature set towards the higher end of the preferred range, and there should be plenty of flat rocks such as slate for the female to deposit her eggs on to. The best way to obtain a compatible pair is to purchase a group of young fish and allow them to pair off naturally. Once a pair has formed, the remaining fish should be moved to another tank (this includes tankmates) for their own safety. A large, cool water change often triggers the fish into spawning, at which time the female will turn a deep red colour. The pair will select a spawning site and clean it thoroughly. Spawning is an active affair and the male can be very vigorous in his pursuit of the female. Observe them carefully in case she shows signs that she is unwilling, as the eager male has been known to harass the female to death if she is not ready. Spawning occurs in much the same manner as many other cichlid species, with the female depositing a line of eggs on the cleaned spawning site, then moving away to be replaced by the male who fertilises them. Up to 300 eggs may be laid, and these will hatch within 48 hours. During this time, the female takes care of the eggs, whilst the male fiercely guards the perimeter. Once the eggs hatch, the entire brood will be moved into a pre-dug pit near to the spawning site, and may be moved again to other pits before they become free-swimming (usually a further 4-6 days). At this point, they can be offered baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) or microworm. The parent fish will continue to care for the young for 4 weeks or so, after which point the fry should be moved to another aquarium as the parents are quite likely to spawn again.",

D\u00c3\u00a9cor such as ocean rock can be used to build sturdy structures which stretch from the base of the tank to near the surface of the water. These structures should be built with the purpose of creating many crevices for the fish to explore but constructed in such a way so as to keep the rocks stable if the fish start to dig around and underneath them. Although a substrate of coral sand or Aragonite is often recommended to help to keep the water hard and alkaline, Mbuna feel safer and show better colours over a darker substrate. The Aragonite or coral sand can always be placed into a mesh bag and kept inside the external filter for buffering purposes. Most rock-dwelling species are extremely aggressive and need to be kept under conditions of 'controlled-overcrowding' to prevent territorial disputes ending fatally - additional filtration may also be required to cope with a heavy bioload. P. johannii is a belligerent species, and it is best to keep one male in a harem situation with several females (keeping just one female with a male will result in continual harassment and possibly death). This species can be kept successfully alongside other outgoing Mbuna, although it is best to avoid fish with a similar colour pattern. This fish was, for years, known as Melanochromis johannii, but it was deemed to be more closely related to Pseudotropheus.

Lake Kamakawaiar (or Lake Kamaka as it is also known) is a clearwater lake with a muddy substrate and patchy aquatic vegetation, which lies less than 5km from the coast and is surrounded by forested limestone hills. Kamaka Rainbowfish are a peaceful species, ideally suited to community aquaria. These beautiful steel blue fish should be maintained in groups of 6 or more due to their shoaling nature. The aquarium should be fairly spacious, as this is an active species. As with many other Rainbowfish species, the juveniles can look a little drab compared to the absolutely stunning adult fish, and so are all too often overlooked in the shops. However, once settled into the security of the planted aquarium, these young specimens will soon begin to colour up, revealing their true adult beauty. Kamaka Rainbowfish will not bother smaller tankmates, as their mouth/throat is too narrow to be able to swallow them. This species is seldom seen in the shops, and is well worth looking out for on account of its peacefulness, beauty, ease of maintenance, and rarity in the trade.",

        "breeding": "A separate good-sized breeding aquarium should be set up with 75% mature tank water and 25% of dechlorinated fresh water, along with a substrate of marbles. A small air-driven sponge filter (with a mature sponge) should be added to give gentle circulation and filtration. The temperature should be set to the higher end of the preferred range. A conditioned pair should then be acclimatised across to the breeding aquarium, which should be furnished with plenty of fine-leaved plants/Java moss clumps and floating mops. After a time, the male will swim in front of the female, displaying the mating stripe on his forehead. He will then begin to drive the female over the plants, utilising the whole length of the tank. The eggs will be scattered over the plants a few at a time. These fish are known as 'continual spawners' which means that the spawning activity takes place over several days/weeks, even months in some cases. This can present problems to the aquarist in that some adult fish may begin to consume the eggs as they are scattered. Many fishkeepers have found the eggs to be remarkably tough and have had great success in siphoning them out into another aquarium (containing matching water from the spawning tank) or else using spawning mops, which, when having caught a number of the eggs, can be moved to a separate tank (again with matching water) and replaced with a new mop, as and when each series of eggs are deposited. The eggs will usually hatch around 10 days (dependent on temperature) and once free-swimming, the tiny fry can be offered infusoria, moving onto larger foodstuffs as they develop.",

Here, it inhabits clear, cool streams with moderate flow and sandy substrates. The natural habitat should be emulated as closely as possible in the home aquarium by employing powerful filtration and using additional powerheads to create areas of decent current and to oxygenate the water efficiently. Depending on your location, a means of chilling the water may be needed during the warmest parts of the year. As with all botiids, these loaches must only be added to aquariums that are biologically mature. Create a multitude of hiding spots and 'visual barriers' with smooth rounded rocks, cobbles, and pebbles of varying sizes, along with some driftwood. Ensure that the substrate has no sharp edges as these loaches will enjoy digging around the bottom of the tank in their search for titbits of food, and it is important that nothing damages their delicate sensory barbels. Dim lighting is preferable, and a well-covered tank is a must as these loaches are expert jumpers and can escape through the tiniest of openings. As with all botiids, S. robusta fares best with company of its own kind; 3 specimens should be considered the absolute minimum housed together, with 5 or more being much healthier. This will not only allow these fish to form a complex social hierarchy and behave naturally within a shoal, but will also help to spread any territorial behaviour amongst the group. Due to a mildly aggressive temperament, these fish are best housed alongside other fairly robust species, and tankmates could include other temperate botiids, some of the torpedo-shaped nemacheilid loaches, Crossocheilus spp., Garra spp., and some of the medium sized Devario or barb species.",

It belongs to the Mbuna group of cichlids. The aquarium should be at least 4ft long and aquascaped to emulate a rocky reef effect with some open expanses of sand. D\u00c3\u00a9cor such as ocean rock can be used to build sturdy structures which stretch from the base of the tank to near the surface of the water. These structures should be built with the purpose of creating many crevices for the fish to explore but constructed in such a way so as to keep the rocks stable if the fish start to dig around and underneath them. Although a substrate of coral sand or Aragonite is often recommended to help to keep the water hard and alkaline, Mbuna feel safer and show better colours over a darker substrate. The Aragonite or coral sand can always be placed into a mesh bag and kept inside the external filter for buffering purposes. Most rock-dwelling species are extremely aggressive and need to be kept under conditions of 'controlled-overcrowding' to prevent territorial disputes ending fatally - additional filtration may also be required to cope with a heavy bioload. The Kenyi Cichlid is a belligerent species, and it is best to keep one male in a harem situation with several females (keeping just one female with a male will result in continual harassment and possibly death). This species can be kept successfully alongside other outgoing Mbuna, although it is best to avoid fish with a similar colour pattern. Interestingly, this species exhibits reverse sexual dichromatism, female fish being blue in colour with dark stripes, and the males are a bright yellow; to confuse matters, juvenile or sub-dominant males also sport the blue colouration.",
        "feeding": "The diet should be primarily vegetarian. Foods rich in animal protein could cause Malawi Bloat, which can be fatal. A good quality Spirulina-based green flake should be mixed with a standard quality flake food, and offered along with appropriately sized granular foods specifically developed for Mbuna. An occasional treat of Mysis shrimp can be given, but this should only be offered very occasionally. Vegetable matter such as cucumber, blanched spinach and romaine lettuce can be fed on a regular basis.",
        "breeding": "When ready to spawn, the colouration of the male will intensify and his aggression level will heighten. He will choose and clean a spawning site, then display to the female fish until one accepts him. They will circle each other in a head to tail manner a number of times, until the female deposits her eggs. These are deposited just one or two at a time and after doing so, she immediately turns around and picks them up. At the same time, the male will rotate so that he is almost on his side, at the same time shaking and extending his anal fin, releasing his milt. The female sees the egg spots on the male\"\u2122s anal fin and attempts to pick up those \"\u0153eggs\"\u009d whilst she is picking up the real ones that she deposited, and at the same time taking in milt. This is the method of fertilisation, and this ritual may go on for some hours.

Older records suggest this species was also present on the island of Trinidad, but it's not clear if they are still resident. The natural habitat consists of small, clear coastal creeks and tributaries with little current and an abundance of decaying wood, submerged roots, and in some areas, dense marginal vegetation. The water is often stained a tea colour from the tannins formed from decaying organic matter in the water. Most fish in the trade are captive bred and will happily acclimatise to a wide range of conditions, but if your fish are wild caught, they will be much more delicate, requiring soft, acidic water. The aquarium should be mature and at least 3ft long (preferably larger) with a soft sand substrate. Provide a plethora of hiding places amongst tangles of driftwood, rocky caves, and robust planting, including some floating species to help diffuse the light. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement fairly gentle, and frequent partial water changes should be carried out on a regular basis to keep nitrate at a minimum. Juvenile Keyhole Cichlids are quite gregarious and can be kept in good-sized groups. However, as they mature, pairs will form naturally, and they may become much more territorial if they intend to spawn. This should not cause too much of an issue in spacious aquaria. Tankmates should be peaceful and of small-medium size (large enough not to be eaten, yet small enough not to harass these peaceable cichlids). Ideal companions could include Corydoras catfish, hatchetfish, pencilfish, tetras, and suckermouth catfish. The presence of such 'dither fish' should help encourage these shy cichlids to venture out into the open a little more. When Keyhole Cichlids sense danger, they are capable of dramatic colour change, quickly taking on a dark cryptic pattern, blending into the substrate and immediate surroundings. Take care when carrying out maintenance on the aquarium, as these fish are so easily startled.",

The male immediately follows behind her and fertilises them, and this is repeated until several hundred eggs are laid/fertilised. The female then guards the eggs whilst the male patrols the perimeter. The eggs should hatch within 3 days, and the wrigglers will be free-swimming just a few days later. At this point, the fry can be offered newly hatched baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and moved on to larger foodstuffs as they grow.

The temperature of the water should be raised to 28-30 \u00b0C and it must be extremely well-filtered and highly oxygenated. Provide a selection of small caves which have an entrance only marginally bigger than the fish \" these can either be formed from arranging the rockwork in such a way that small secluded crevices are created, or pre-constructed from small pieces of slate siliconed together. It is crucial that these caves are situated in an area with decent water movement. When in spawning condition, males will choose a preferred cave and defend it from any other males present, whilst at the same time, will try to entice a ripe female inside. Spawning does not always take place straight away, indeed it can be some days before the female is ready to deposit her eggs, but the fish will remain inside the cave together during this time, the male usually blocks the entrance. Once the eggs have been laid and fertilised, the male fish often has to force the female out of the cave before he begins his parental guarding duties. The female plays no further part in brood care, but the male will be seen fanning the eggs with his pectoral fins and blocking the cave entrance from any intruders. Eggs typically number between 20 and 60 and take around a week to hatch. The fry will feed from their sizeable yolk sacs for the first few days, and after this has been consumed, they will require very regular feedings of baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii), microworms, and various small or crushed dried sinking foods. It is important that food is available to the fry at all times as they can all too easily starve, but keep a very close eye on water quality when feeding constantly, and perform lots of very regular but very small partial changes to keep nitrogenous waste levels as low as possible. The adult King Tiger Plecs pose no threat to the fry, but other fish sharing the same tank might do.

Large adults are capable of taking small fish species, so be sure to house them with appropriately sized tankmates. Multiple specimens may be kept together providing that the aquarium is furnished with plenty of rocky caves and crevices (visual barriers), in order for these fish to form their territories. If there aren\"\u2122t enough territories per fish, they will become aggressive with one another; as a guide, at least two or three hiding places per fish should be provided. It is best to use a soft sand substrate or fine smooth rounded gravel as these fish will spend the majority of their time on the bottom of the tank. Lighting should not be too bright as these fish can be a little timid in well-lit situations. Plants tolerant of low light brackish conditions may be grown, as these fish pose no threat to them. Knight Gobies are unforgiving of less than ideal conditions, so powerful filtration and a regular maintenance schedule is a must. Keep the tank well-covered as these fish will jump.",

        "care": "A domesticated version of the wild carp, Koi or Nishikigoi (which translates from Japanese as 'brocaded carp') were bred from food fish introduced from China. Their story mirrors that of goldfish and unusually coloured individuals are mentioned in records dating back around 1,300 years ago. Around 200 years ago, more focused selective breeding began and gradually gave rise to the varieties that are known today. Like pedigree dogs, koi colours are named and recognised but the outcome of their breeding is far less predictable, meaning that very few of the offspring make the grade. Of course, these differences are only skin deep, and this leads to the extreme variations in the value of these fishes - an expensive high-grade fish may well literally be one in a million. As they can be produced in greater quantity, lower grade fish are a good deal cheaper to buy but outside of the realms of showing, beauty is in the eye of the beholder! Whatever their grade, koi share the typical carp traits that make them one of the best of all pet fish, soon learning to associate their keeper with food and happily feeding from the hand. Some varieties are known to be more friendly than others and these often more modestly coloured fish can help make their companions more confident.\nKoi are big fish and need big ponds. To ensure healthy development and maximise water volume, a pond designed for koi should be at least 1.2m/4' deep but the bigger the better. These are pets that get better with age and tend to outgrow smaller facilities, this leads to serious owners often upgrading their ponds as their fishes mature. Large, greedy carp in big ponds need serious filtration and this is a factor to be considered at the planning stage, with helpful hardware such as bottom drains installed in the early stages of construction. The fact that many standard garden ponds have one or two koi swimming amongst goldfish and orfe is a tribute to how hardy they are, and they'll enjoy uprooting the plants and foraging in the mud in the same way their wild ancestors did. The fact that dedicated koi ponds tend to be bare is testament to the fact that they demolish most attempts at planting, so ensure any vegetation is out of reach and consider adding a \"plant filter\" where the benefit of waste removal can be harnessed safe from the fishes. Unlike wildlife ponds, carp ponds are best filled using tap water to ensure healthy mineral content - keepers in soft water areas are advised to add buffers to increase KH levels and monitor these alongside the usual parameters such as ammonia and nitrite. As these conditions favour the growth of algae, an ultraviolet clarifier is usually an essential piece of equipment to maintain the clear water that allows you to appreciate your colourful pets.\nKoi tend to be labelled in a number of ways, including country of origin (expect to pay more for Japanese fish), grade and occasionally variety names such as Ogon, Kohaku, Sanke, Showa, Utsuri, Shusui, Chagoi etc. Long-finned fish are generally known as Butterfly koi.\nRecent studies have shown that the origins of domesticated koi and their genetics point to them being descended from the Eastern Amur carp C. rubrofuscus and not C. carpio.",
        "feeding": "Good quality specialised diets are available for all sizes of these fish including pellets and sticks. Take care to avoid the temptation of overfeeding - adding food little and often will soon train the fish to associate their owner with food. Feeding is linked to temperature and it's important to offer a cold weather formulation in late autumn, winter and early spring. Prawns, earthworms, lettuce and even orange segments are all good treats to be fed now and again.",
        "breeding": "Spawnings will occur naturally in the pond if sexually mature males and females are present, where conditions are to their liking (water quality, water temperature, light levels etc), and where there is a medium such as mops/ropes/brushes where the eggs can be scattered. However, many spawnings go unnoticed as the eggs are often consumed quickly by the parents and other fish in the pond. To ensure survival of the eggs/fry, the aquarist will usually have to intervene, collecting the eggs before they are devoured, and keeping them in a spacious container with pond plants and some continuous form of gentle oxygenation. The eggs typically hatch within 4-5 days, and the fry will feed on their yolk sacs for the first few days, after which time a constant supply of small live foods such as infusoria and daphnia will be required. Koi, of course, can be selectively bred in separate breeding ponds if the aquarist is fortunate to have access to this type of set-up. In this scenario, the water of the breeding pond should match that of the main pond, and it should be lined with spawning ropes and the like. A well-conditioned selected pair can then be added and observed regularly for signs of spawning. Once the eggs have been deposited over the spawning medium, these can be separated from the parents and grown on in an independent container as described above. Fry from home spawnings usually provide a great example of the work needed to produce quality fish, as typically the fish most likely to thrive are the ones closest to their wild carp ancestors.",

Once inside the cave, the female will lay between 50 and 300 eggs on the ceiling of the cave structure, which are attached by small threads. The female will look after the eggs, fanning them with her pectoral fins, whilst the male will guard the perimeter of the cave. After 2-3 days, the eggs should hatch, and after a further 4-5 days the fry will become free-swimming. The parents will take great care of the fry, herding them around the tank in a shoal.

These peaceful, active, shoaling fish are known from clear rivers and their tributary streams, as well as clear lakes with substrates of mud, rock,and sand. Provide them with a mature aquarium around 3ft in length, with a moderate current and plenty of hiding places amongst driftwood and plants (they particularly enjoy swimming in amongst plants with long, trailing roots). The water should be well-filtered, with some additional means of aeration such as a small powerhead with the flow diverter angled up towards the water's surface, and the substrate should consist of soft sand, as these fish sometimes like to pick at the substrate in search of micro-crustaceans - and some gravels can be rather coarse. Tankmates should be of similar size and temperament, and enjoy the same conditions; gobies, glassfish, and many of the rainbowfish make for excellent companions. Although the Kubuna Hardyhead commands quite a price at present, please bear in mind that this is a species that really must be kept in groups of 6 or more, as in nature it is known to form sizeable shoals. Kept this way, these fish will feel more secure and should settle in quickly, showing off their subtle, but beautiful colours in a natural-looking shoal. High water quality is essential to the well-being of Craterocephalusspecies, so regular partial water changes are essential.",

        "breeding": "Some Craterocephalus species have been bred in the home aquarium, largely by Australian aquarists who tend to see these species in the aquatic trade more often than we do in the UK. The fish should be conditioned in the main tank on a diet of various live/frozen foods. In the meantime, a separate breeding aquarium should be set up with matching water parameters, plenty of fine-leaved plants such as Java moss, and a small air-driven sponge filter. Increase the temperature of the breeding set up to the top of the preferred range, and then carefully acclimatize a male and female across. These fish are thought to be continuous spawners, and breed in a manner similar to rainbowfishes; the pair being likely to spawn on a daily basis for several days. The adhesive eggs will be scattered over the plants and should hatch in around 7-10 days. Some of the eggs may be eaten by the parents, but if enough plant cover is provided, the majority should avoid their attention. Acclimatize the parents back to the mainaquarium after a few days to allow the female to recuperate, and to prevent more eggs from being eaten. Once the eggs have hatched, the young will feed on their yolk sacs for the first few days, then will start to need supplemental feeding several times per day with infusoria, baby brineshrimp, and microform. Be sure to carry out plenty of very small, but very frequent water changes to ensure that nitrate is not allowed to build up.",

As the fish come in to spawning condition, the aggression between males can really heighten, and they can cause great damage to each other, and this has even be known to have a fatal outcome on some occasions. This is why many fishkeepers choose to house one male with a harem of females. However, these catfish are completely peaceable towards other fish species and can be kept safely alongside other temperate species such as some of the dwarf cichlids, tetras, danios, and barbs.

Water lilies (Nymphaea sp.) and lotus (Nelumbo sp.) are abundant, and the lake is surrounded by steep, grass covered hills. Lake Wanam Rainbowfish are a peaceful shoaling species ideally suited to the planted community aquarium. They should be kept in groups of 6 or more fish, and because of their active nature and moderate adult size, the aquarium should be at least 4ft long to allow them a good amount of swimming space. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement fairly gentle, and frequent partial water changes will help keep nitrate to a minimum - particularly important as this species is sensitive to the build-up of organic wastes. As with many other rainbowfish species, the juveniles can look comparatively drab to the absolutely stunning adult fish, and so are all too often overlooked in the shops. However, once settled into the security of the planted aquarium, these young specimens will soon begin to colour up, revealing their true adult beauty. The males in particular will develop a positively dazzling appearance, with the dominant male displaying the brightest colours of all. Despite their large and deep-bodied adult size, Lake Wanam Rainbowfish will not bother smaller tankmates as their mouths/throats are too narrow to be able to swallow them. Unfortunately, this species is listed as 'critically endangered' on the IUCN redlist of endangered species, largely due to the introduction of non-native, predatory carp and Tilapia, in addition to increased human settlement around the lake.

Many fishkeepers have found the eggs to be remarkably tough and have had great success in siphoning them out into another aquarium (containing matching water from the spawning tank). The eggs will usually hatch in 6-9 days (dependent on temperature) and once free-swimming, the tiny fry can be offered infusoria, moving onto larger foodstuffs such as baby brineshrimp and fine crushed flake foods as they develop.",

        "care": "Lamontichthys filamentosus, also known as the Kite Plec, is known from fast-flowing waters of the western Amazon basin. Despite the somewhat fragile appearance of this fish, it must be housed in an aquarium with strong current and a high level of oxygenation. The high-velocity natural habitat should be replicated by use of extra powerheads (in addition to the return flow from canister filters) to create a river type effect. The surface of the water should be visibly moving to ensure that there is a high amount of oxygenation within the water at all times. An additional air-pump is also a handy back-up. Without such a high level of oxygenation and water movement, this species will not fare well at all. Kite Plecs should only be added to aquariums that are biologically mature. Such tanks will have a good established growth of algae for the fish to graze upon in order to consume the micro-organisms within, and will provide a source of nourishment whilst the fish may be adapting to the taking of prepared foods. The front glass can be wiped free of algae, but it is recommended that you allow algae to freely colonise the sides and back glass, and over the decor. Lighting should be bright in order to encourage a decent amount of algal growth. Provide a multitude of hiding spots amongst rocks, cobbles and bogwood. Flat smooth rocks should be placed in the path of the flow, where these fish will often congregate. Plants can be incorporated into the river-style aquarium, but not all species will flourish under the conditions of fast current. Having said this, many aquarists have had a good deal of success with Anubias species, Java fern (Microsorum sp.) and some species of Cryptocoryne, such as C. balansae. Plants are not found in the natural habitat of Kite Plecs, so are not considered essential, but they will help with water quality and will make the aquarium look more aesthetically pleasing. This is a peaceful species which may be kept in good sized groups. Tankmates should be small and peaceful and enjoy fast-flowing conditions. Recommended for experienced fishkeepers only.",
        "feeding": "Although these fish will graze upon the natural algae within the aquarium for the small micro-organisms it may contain, the diet must be supplemented with small frozen foods such as mosquito larvae, daphnia, cyclops, Spirulina-enriched brineshrimp etc and vegetable matter e.g. cucumber or courgette. Some specimens will also adapt to taking dried foods such as sinking catfish pellets, algae wafers, and sheets of Nori, although frozen foods tend to be preferred. Do not offer an excessive amount of meaty foods as this will lead to health problems.",

Spawning tends to be a secretive affair, with the female depositing her eggs (which may number 40-60) on the sides of the cave or shell, or on the rock next to the depression they have excavated. Once the male has fertilised the eggs, he is driven away from the nest site by the female who then guards the eggs, fanning them with her pectoral fins. The eggs should hatch after 72 hours (temperature dependent), with the fry becoming free-swimming around a week later. At this point they will be large enough to accept baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii). The fry will stay close to the spawning site, and multiple generations are usually tolerated.

N. cylindricus is moderately aggressive towards its own kind and should only be kept with other Tanganyikan cichlids of a similar disposition (and which have the same dietary needs). They are not suitable for housing alongside small shell-dwellers.

The bond these fish form when breeding is very weak and typically only lasts for the duration of the spawning event and subsequent brood care. In between spawns, the male may become intolerant of the female, which is why a good sized tank with a multitude of hiding places/visual barriers is essential. In the wild, spawning occurs in the females' preferred cave. The same process frequently occurs in the home aquarium, with the ripe female leading the chosen male from his territory to her cave. Other times, the pair may be seen excavating a cave from scratch. The female then deposits her olive-coloured eggs (usually numbering between 30 and 100) on the sides of the cave, the male immediately swimming over them and fertilising with his sperm. It is not always obvious when these fish have spawned, as oftentimes they are very secretive and the cave may be hidden from view. Once spawning has finished, the female will tend to the eggs, with the male fish guarding the perimeter of the cave. The eggs should hatch within 4-5 days (temperature dependent), with the fry becoming free swimming some 10-14 days later.

These diminutive fish are shoaling by nature and are often observed congregating in their thousands. The home aquarium should be biologically mature with high standards of water quality maintained at all times; Lampeyes are a relatively delicate fish and require stable water conditions with plenty of cover in the form of driftwood and plants. Water movement must be kept as gentle as possible, and dark substrate and decor choices will help to bring out the vibrant blue colour in the upper irises of these tiny fish (which, interestingly, is even visible on fry that are just a few days old). Despite the small adult size of these fish, the tank itself should be fairly spacious, as they are an active species, especially when breeding. Lighting should be fairly dim, although brighter lighting can be employed if there is plenty of surface cover in the form of floating plants such as Ceratopteris, or Pistia species. Always maintain this peaceful, timid species in good sized groups of at least 10 specimens. Many aquarists like to keep them in a dedicated species-only set-up that is tailored specifically to their needs, but they can be kept alongside other tiny peaceable species such as African Jellybean Tetras (Ladigesia roloffi), Ember Tetras (Hyphessobrycon amandae), pencilfish, Pygmy Corydoras, Boraras spp., and some of the smaller anabantoids. However, they are not suitable as general community fish as they are easily intimidated and will be predated upon by larger fish.

        "breeding": "Lampeyes are relatively easy to breed, and in densely planted aquaria, small numbers of fry are likely appear from time to time. However, if you wish to raise a larger number of young, a separate breeding aquarium should be set up for this purpose. A small tank filled with water from the main tank, filtered by a simple air-driven sponge filter, and fitted with a small sized heater to keep the temperature stable, along with several large clumps of Java Moss or spawning mops is all that is required. Acclimatise well-conditioned fish (ideally one male with 2 or 3 females) to the breeding aquarium, and spawning should occur quite readily and without too much intervention (sometimes a small water change is required to get them started). The eggs, which are relatively large for such a small fish, are moderately adhesive and will be scattered over the spawning medium, with incubation typically taking around 12-14 days depending on the water temperature. The young are able to take infusoria and finely powdered fry foods immediately upon hatching, moving on to Artemia nauplii as they grow. Some aquarists like to move the adults back to the main aquarium after a good number of eggs have been deposited to ensure that there is no predation, yet others leave them in situ because the adults rarely predate on their own eggs or fry. However, it is possible that larger fry may predate on much smaller fry, so larger youngsters should be acclimatised to the main aquarium as soon as they are big enough. In general, growth is usually rather slow, and the young can be expected to reach sexual maturity within 6 months. The fry are very sensitive to the build up of nitrogenous wastes, so partial water changes must be carried out frequently to ensure excellent water quality at all times.",

The eyes are small and set underneath the tentacles on the broad, tactile snout. In the wild, these snails have been found living in both fresh and brackish water, and it is believed that they need slightly saline conditions in order to reproduce. They are great for peaceful community tanks containing small, peaceful species of fish and shrimp that enjoy the same conditions. Avoid keeping them in aquaria that contain loaches, pufferfish, any large/aggressive fish, and any pushy species that will outcompete the snails for food; these snails cannot survive on leftovers alone. Ensure the tank is well filtered/oxygenated and that regular partial water changes are carried out, at the same time carefully siphoning away any mulm that can accumulate from the snail's waste products. Acclimatize them carefully, as you would do for fish, and they will begin to explore their new surroundings when ready; many have reported that they seem to be crepuscular in nature. Provide a sandsubstrate, which is not only softer on the body of the snail as it pulls itself along, but is easier to keep clean compared to gravel. Be sure to supply a variety of low, flat rocks and cobbles for the snails to explore, and avoid any sharp decor. This species is likely to munch on soft-leaved plants, so choose robust greenery, and remember to leave large areas free of vegetation so that the snails can move around with ease. Their rather unique, jerky fashion of locomotion is fascinating to watch, as they have their large shells along behind them.

They may not always show their best colours in shop stock tanks, but once settled into the home aquarium, their yellow tones will intensify, especially when kept in blackwater set ups. As with many deeper-bodied tetras, social behaviour usually features males defending their personal space against rivals and displaying to passing females. Generations of captive breeding have produced sturdy, adaptable fish that are suitable for a range of aquaria including those housing large non-predatory cichlids such as eartheaters.\n  After decades of popularity as an aquarium pet, the mystery of this fish's wild origin was discovered in 1980 when they were found in the Tapajos river basin, although this might be an account of the closely-related form currently traded as the Orange lemon tetra. Subsequently they've been reported from the Xingu, which may be a more accurate observation for this familiar species. An albino variety is also available.",

Adults tend to inhabit larger rivers.\nThis oddball makes an unusual addition to the peaceful fish community where there are no small fish present. The aquarium should have a soft sand substrate so that these diggers can bury themselves, and plenty of hiding places amongst plant thickets, bogwood, smooth rocky caves, PVC pipes and so on. Larger specimens are capable of undermining the decor, so do ensure everything is well supported and secure (many aquarists like to place the decor on the base of the aquarium prior to adding substrate around it). Indian Almond Leaves (Terminalia catappa) are also very much appreciated as 'leaf litter', but these must be replaced on a regular basis as they gradually decompose. The footprint (length and width) of the tank is much more important than the height. Lighting can be diffused with the use of floating plants if the eels are shy, but keeping them in groups will often give them the confidence to be more day active. Although they tend to stay buried for much of the day with just their snouts protruding from the cover, they do become very active at night. Be sure that the aquarium has no gaps at the top, as these fish are great escape artists. Spiny Eels are not aggressive, but adults are capable of taking small fish overnight, so tankmates must be chosen with care. Neon Tetra sized fish, for example, are not recommended. Suggested tankmates would be large Rasboras, large gouramis, rainbowfish, L-number suckermouth cats etc. Spiny Eels are fairly sociable and are best kept in groups of 5 or more.

When the female is spent of eggs, the male will drive her away and takes on brood care by himself. The eggs should hatch within 24-72 hours, with the fry free-swimming some 5-7 days later. The young will require infusoria followed by baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) as they grow. In a densely planted tank, some fry may survive, but if you wish to raise larger numbers, they should be separated from the parents once free-swimming.

        "care": "The Lionhead is a selectively bred strain of goldfish, like the Ranchu it lacks a dorsal fin but can be distinguished by a longer, less curved back. Domesticated goldfish date back to China\"\u2122s Ming dynasty and Fancy goldfish have long been popular aquarium pets, although often as a first venture into keeping an aquarium. This is a mixed blessing, as there are far better choices for small aquaria than these big, messy fishes. Given appropriate housing and care, fancy goldfish can attain a large size and easily live for more than 15-20 years. The aquarium should be spacious and ideally around 1.2 metres long to allow room for 30cm adults to be comfortable. The length and width of the tank are much more important than the height in this respect.\nFancy goldfish grow quickly so it is best to provide them with the largest aquarium that you can from the outset to provide a much safe, stable environment for them. The larger the volume of water, the more stable it will be in terms of water chemistry and temperature. During the warmer months, these fish can be kept outside in raised water features suitably filtered and protected from predators. This can be a great way to provide extra room for your pets and they\"\u2122ll benefit from the semi-natural conditions. Like any goldfish, lionheads will benefit from a seasonal drop in temperature and this can be provided by either moving them indoors in late autumn, or positioning their aquarium in a room that experiences cool room temperatures during the winter. Fancy goldfish are notoriously messy fish; they are voracious eaters and continually stir up the substrate in their ongoing search for food. Such considerable amounts of waste can lead to water quality issues in smaller aquaria if not monitored very closely. Efficient filtration that can handle copius solids is essential, and weekly partial water changes are advised in order to keep nitrate to a minimum. The water should be well-oxygenated (of particular importance during warmer spells of weather) and this is easily achieved by the use of spray-bar returns from filters or the use of an air pumps. Various species of robust plants can be added to the aquarium, but these will likely require periodic replacement due to them being uprooted/eaten - something most goldfish keepers accept and allow their fish to take pleasure in. The substrate can consist of rounded fine gravel or sand, and decor can include smooth rocks and ornaments with no sharp edges. Lionheads are sociable creatures and should be kept in groups, either with their own kind or with other varieties of fancy goldfish. It is best, however, to avoid keeping the standard 'single-tailed' common goldfish alongside the fancy varieties as the common goldfish is a faster swimmer and may outcompete the fancies at feeding time. Several colour varieties of Lionhead are available, including black, blue, chocolate, red, red and white, red cap, white, yellow, and calico.",
        "feeding": "Due to their body shape, these fish need a high fibre diet and digestive problems are often the cause of buoyancy issues as transit times are compromised by convoluted digestive tracts. Goldfish also tend to swallow air in their rush to feed which also leads to problems which are best avoided by the use of sinking foods. These can be in the form of pellets, sticks or flake presented beneath the water surface. Frozen foods or live foods such as bloodworm, Mysis, and Daphnia will provide fibre and can be fed extensively to individuals displaying issues that are often categorised as Swim Bladder Disease. The opportunity to browse on aquatic plants will help to ensure gut health.",
        "breeding": "Well-conditioned fancy goldfish will often spawn in the home aquarium. Female fish will be noticeably rounder bellied when full of eggs, and the male fish will develop spawning tubercles (tiny raised bumps) on the gill plates and pectoral fins. A large, slightly cooler water change is often enough to trigger ready pairs into spawning. As the temperature slowly rises back up to its usual level, the male will pursue the female around the aquarium, but generally in a non-aggressive manner. This courtship ritual may last more than a day before spawning commences, and the colours of the fish often intensify at this time. The male fish will nudge the female into the fine-leaved plants (or spawning mops), where she will then scatter eggs which the male simultaneously fertilises. Spawning can last for a number of hours, and several thousand adhesive eggs may be scattered over the plants/spawning mop. The adults will be hungry and will start to devour as many eggs as they can find, so are best moved to another aquarium. The eggs take 4-5 days to hatch, depending on water temperature. Young fancy goldfish are often brown in colour (like their ancestors) and it can take up to a year before full colouration becomes apparent. Fancy goldfish often produce young that differ from their parents - high quality fish that show the best attributes of their breed are normally in the minority, hence the differences in price and quality between fish.",

Unfortunately, exact habitat details are somewhat scarce, but the lake environment consists of relatively clear water with areas of dense marginal vegetation. This species has a delicate beauty and is generally peaceful towards other fish, providing they do not have fancy long fins - such species are best avoided. However, male Lipstick Barbs can be rather antagonistic with one another. This behaviour can be controlled by acquiring a large sized shoal (15-20 specimens) with at least 3 females to every male. In addition, despite the small adult size, the tank must be spacious and furnished with plenty of decor to crate visual barriers. Dense areas of robust planting, tangles of driftwood, rocky caves, and cobbles can all be used to good effect.

        "care": "The Llanero Whiptail is native to shallow running water, where it lives amongst rocks and debris. Its colour and pattern gives it good camouflage amongst accumulated twigs and branches.\nDespite the somewhat fragile appearance of this fish, it should be housed in an aquarium with strong current and a high level of oxygenation. The high-velocity natural habitat should be replicated by use of extra powerheads (in addition to the return flow from canister filters) to create a river type effect. The surface of the water should be visibly moving to ensure that there is a high amount of oxygenation within the water at all times. An additional air-pump is also a handy back-up. Without such a high level of oxygenation and water movement, this species will not fare well at all. Whiptails should only be added to aquariums that are biologically mature. Such tanks will have a good established growth of algae for the fish to graze upon in order to consume the micro-organisms within, and will provide a source of nourishment whilst the fish may be adapting to the taking of prepared foods. The front glass can be wiped free of algae, but it is recommended that you allow algae to freely colonise the sides and back glass, and over the decor. Lighting should be bright in order to encourage a decent amount of algal growth. Provide a multitude of hiding spots amongst rocks, cobbles and bogwood. Flat smooth rocks should be placed in the path of the flow, where these fish will often congregate. Plants can be incorporated into the river-style aquarium, but not all species will flourish under the conditions of fast current. Having said this, many aquarists have had a good deal of success with Anubias species, Java fern (Microsorum sp.) and some species of Cryptocoryne, such as C. balansae. Plants are not found in the natural habitat, so are not considered essential, but they will help with water quality and will make the aquarium look more aesthetically pleasing. This is a peaceful species which may be kept in good sized groups. Tankmates should be small and peaceful and enjoy fast-flowing conditions. Recommended for experienced fishkeepers only.\nThis fish often arrives labelled as a Sturisoma and may be confused with its relative L. filamentosus. Reports suggest that it's easier to keep.",
        "feeding": "Although these fish will graze upon the natural algae within the aquarium for the small micro-organisms it may contain, the diet must be supplemented with small frozen foods such as mosquito larvae, daphnia, cyclops, Spirulina-enriched brineshrimp etc and vegetable matter e.g. cucumber or courgette. Some specimens will also adapt to taking dried foods such as sinking catfish pellets, algae wafers, and sheets of Nori, although frozen foods tend to be preferred.

This fish is rarely seen in the trade, but is well worth looking out for if you have a mature hillstream style set-up. These shy bottom dwellers have evolved to live in subtropical, fast-flowing, highly oxygenated waters - and this specialised habitat must be replicated in the home aquarium if they are to thrive. Extra powerheads (in addition to the return flow from filters) can be used to create a river type effect; the surface of the water should be visibly moving to ensure that there is a high amount of oxygenation within the water at all times. An additional air-pump is also a handy back-up (but should not be relied upon as the sole means of oxygenation, as it is not enough). Without such a combination of cooler-than-average water temperature and high level of oxygenation, these catfish will not fare well. It is important to provide a soft sand substrate in order to protect the impressive but delicate sensory barbels, and be sure to make a good number of shady hiding places available such as slate caves, driftwood, and PVC pipes for these nocturnal fish to take refuge in during the day - as they do not enjoy bright lighting. This is a fairly territorial species which will fight with its own kind and with other members of the same genus, so space and a copious number of caves/visual barriers are essential if more than one is to be kept in the same aquarium. Adding a blue moon light to your aquarium (which switches on just before the main lights go out) will allow you to spend time observing them under their preferred subdued lighting. Adding some suitable \"dither fish\" to the aquarium may also encourage them to venture out a little more during the daytime, and some of the medium sized species from the barb, Barilius, Danio, and Rasbora families make great companions. However, be aware that A. foratum are micro-predators which do actively hunt at night, so be sure that any tankmates are not of such a small size that they would become an easy snack. Plants can be incorporated into this type of specialist aquarium, but not all species will cope well with fast current. Having said this, many aquarists have had a good deal of success with Anubias species, Java moss (Taxiphyllum barbieri), Java fern (Microsorum sp.) and some species of Cryptocoryne. Plants are not found in great abundance in the natural habitat of A. foratum, so are not considered essential, but they will help with water quality and will make the aquarium look more aesthetically pleasing. Frequent partial water changes are essential for keeping nitrogenous wastes to a minimum. Finally, handle with much care - these fish are traumatogenic, which means they are capable of inflicting a painful sting with their dorsal and pectoral spines, with much swelling and excruciating pain in the afflicted area for several hours.",

If there are other fish present in the tank, make sure your A. foratum are not missing out, target feeding near their caves using a baster if necessary, and offering some foods after lights out.",

They are also found in smaller tributaries and streams, but such specimens never grow as large as those that hail from more voluminous rivers. These characins attain a good size and are energetic swimmers, so the aquarium must be very spacious. A naturally gregarious species, Long-finned Alestes tetras should always be kept in groups of 8 or more. A dark substrate and background, along with areas of dense planting (including floating cover to help diffuse bright lighting) will also help to reduce the skittishness of these fish. The aquarium should be well-filtered and oxygenated, ideally with external canister filtration. Partial water changes should also be carried out on a frequent basis as these fish are intolerant to the build up of nitrogenous wastes. Although Long-finned Alestes tetras are quick and robust without being particularly nippy, tankmates do need to be chosen carefully as small fish will be predated upon by adult specimens. Once settled, these fish are boisterous feeders, which may intimidate slower species, so observe carefully to ensure that no fish are being outcompeted for food. Ideal companions could include other larger African characins, such as Congo Tetras (Phenacogrammus interruptus) or African Red Eye Tetras (Arnoldichthys spilopterus), adult Pelvicachromis cichlids, and Synodontis catfish.

It is thought that spawning commences when the first rays of the morning sun hit the aquarium (although the act has never actually been recorded to date) whereby several hundred orange eggs will be scattered. The pair should be removed as soon as soon after spawning as possible, otherwise they will predate on the eggs. From this point on, the eggs should be kept well-aerated, as a high level of oxygenation would appear to be crucial during the early developmental stages.

Here it inhabits the slower reaches of rivers, living amongst submerged roots and marginal vegetation. P. leopoldi differs from other members of the same genus by the absence of a pre-dorsal notch, and by the presence of a black blotch at the dorsal insertion on the 4th vertical bar. This angelfish always swims with a characteristic 'head-up' position, which is reminiscent of the flag cichlids of the genus Mesonauta. It is a majestic species which, although smaller than its congeners, still requires a taller than average aquarium due to its adult height and long trailing finnage. Soft, acidic water with negligible hardness is requisite. Adults should never be housed with small fish (e.g. Neon Tetras) as they will quickly become a snack. The substrate should be soft and smooth, so as to protect the delicate finnage when the fish are swimming in the lower reaches of the tank, and a good cover of aquatic plants along with some tall pieces of driftwood should be provided in order for the fish to feel safe. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement fairly gentle, and small frequent water changes will help to keep pollutants to a minimum (these fish are very sensitive to elevated nitrates). In larger aquaria, Long-nosed Angelfish can be maintained in good size groups; this will not only make them feel much more secure, but it will result in a much more effective, natural looking shoal. Tankmates should be of similar size, and be of a peaceful disposition. Good companions could include some of the deeper-bodied characins, other medium-sized peaceable South American cichlids, Corydoras catfish etc. Be aware that if a pair of Long-nosed Angelfish form, they will become very territorial when breeding, so observe carefully; however, this should not cause issues in voluminous aquaria. Not recommended for beginners.",
        "feeding": "Frozen foods such as white mosquito larvae, bloodworm, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, Mysis, daphnia etc. As the majority of fish are wild caught, they may require live foods to initiate a feeding response, gradually weaning on to frozen fare and some dried foods such as small sized cichlid pellets.",
        "breeding": "This species has been bred in the home aquarium, but it is a rare occurrence and can be rather difficult. Very soft, acidic water is required, and the tank should be furnished with a selection of potential spawning sites, such as broad-leaved aquatic plants and flat pieces of slate stood upright against the back glass of the aquarium. When ready to spawn, the breeding tubes (genital papillae) will begin to show on both fish, between the ventral and anal fins. Do not disturb the aquarium once egg-laying/fertilisation commences. Typical brood size is around 70. The parents should be left to tend the eggs - they will be seen carefully fanning them with their pectoral fins. After 2-3 days, the eggs should begin to hatch into \"wrigglers\" and after a further 4 or 5 days, they should become free-swimming and they can be offered baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii). However, it is not always this straightforward. Once a pair has formed and they begin spawning, it is not unusual for them to eat their eggs. This can be frustrating and if it keeps occurring, it may be necessary to separate the parents from their spawn if there is to be any chance of success.",

This is a large sized characin that requires an aquarium at least 6ft long with powerful filtration to match. Juvenile fish grow quickly, so spacious quarters are required from the outset. Ideally there will be an open swimming space along the front of the tank, with plenty of hiding places amongst smooth rocks and driftwood towards the back. Substrate type is unimportant, gravel or sand may be used. Long-nosed Distichodus are omnivorous and will eat soft leaved plants, so they are not a good choice for planted aquaria. However, more robust species that can be tied onto the decor, such as Anubias sp, Bolbitis sp, and Java Fern (Microsorum) are often ignored, and will make the tank more aesthetically pleasing. Filtration should be efficient with a moderate - but not overpowering - water flow, and a good level of oxygenation. As a riverine species, these fish will not tolerate a high nitrate level; ensure partial water changes are carried out on a frequent basis to help keep organic wastes to a minimum. Long-nosed Distichodus can behave somewhat unpredictably in the aquarium, with some accepting other large, robust tankmates, and others not tolerating them at all. In voluminous aquaria, juveniles may be kept in groups, but usually as they mature they become increasingly aggressive towards conspecifics and will have to be separated for their own safety. For this reason, it is often better to house just one per tank, allowing it to grow up alongside other large fish that can look after themselves - but do observe carefully. Possible companions could include other large characins (but not other Distichodus species), sizeable cyprinids, large armoured catfish and the like. Ensure that the tank has a heavy, tight fitting lid, as these fish are expert jumpers. This fish is similar in appearance to the Six-bar Distichodus (D. sexfasciatus); however, the Long-nosed Distichodus attains a smaller adult size and is more slender in appearance with the noticeably longer snout.",

        "care": "The Long-nosed Elephant Fish has a widespread distribution across the Congo and Niger River basins, where it is most commonly found in dark, slow-flowing, heavily vegetated waters with sandy or silty substrates. This unusual nocturnal fish has a long, highly sensitive trunk-like extension on the chin, which it uses to probe for food items in the substrate, with the small round mouth located just above it. For this reason, it absolutely must be provided with a soft sand substrate in the home aquarium - gravel is simply not suitable and will cause unnecessary stress and possibly damage. Like other Mormyrids, the Long-nosed Elephant Fish is capable of producing a weak electrical field. The specialised electric organ which discharges the pulses is located in the caudal peduncle, with cutaneous electro receptors distributed over much of the body (including the 'trunk'). This ability to generate an electric field allows the fish to navigate in darkness or in turbid waters, sense the tiniest of movements around it in order to find food and avoid predators, and also to communicate and find a suitable mate. This electrosensory system is relatively weak as far as electric fish go, so poses no risk to the aquarist. This is an endearing fish which does have some specialist care requirements, in addition to the aforementioned sandy substrate. Firstly, it attains a large size, so a spacious aquarium (at least 5ft long and a minimum 2ft wide) is a must. Secondly, it must be provided with a choice of shady hiding spots e.g. PVC tubes, rocky caves/overhangs (do ensure such structures are stable), and large tangles of driftwood. The lighting should not be too bright as these nocturnal fish are sensitive to intense illumination; if the tank must be brightly lit in some areas, provide plenty of broad leaved aquatic plants and floating species to help diffuse the light. Nonetheless, there absolutely must be areas of darkness within the tank that the fish can retreat to during the day as necessary. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement fairly gentle, and there should be a consistent maintenance regime in place encompassing regular partial water changes, as these fish are sensitive to elevated nitrate and sudden changes in water chemistry. Long-nosed Elephant Fish are somewhat timid and generally peaceful with other fish, but they are rather territorial with their own kind and closely related species. It is best to keep just one to a tank and not with any other elephantnose species, unless the aquarium is extremely voluminous. In such aquaria, a group of 6 or more could be maintained together, but there must be ample swimming room and a plethora of visual barriers. It is not a good idea to try and maintain a smaller group than this, as the dominant fish will pick on the weaker individuals, often with disastrous consequences. This way, no one fish will bear the continual brunt of any territorial aggression. Also worth bearing in mind, is that in the confines of the home aquarium, electrogenic fish can sometimes become stressed by the presence of other such species due to their electrical fields overlapping, so abundant space is absolutely essential to their long-term wellbeing. Tankmates should be medium-sized and of a peaceful nature, and good companions could include African Butterfly Fish, Angelfish, bichirs, Ctenopoma spp., Geophagus spp., gouramis, large deep bodied tetras such as Phenacogrammus spp., Synodontis catfish etc. Avoid housing with any aggressive or boisterous species, as otherwise the elephantnoses will be outcompeted at feeding time. Blue moon lighting, timed to come on just before the main lights switch off in the evening, is useful in observing your fish for a few hours under the preferred subdued lighting. Hopefully, if the tank is maintained appropriately and new fish are quarantined carefully before adding the main aquarium, the need for medications should not arise. However, if treatment is required, take much care as these fish are classed as 'scaleless' and are particularly sensitive to medications (always check with the manufacturer before using - some treatments are not safe, and others may need half dosing). Many aquarists also find that running a UV steriliser on the tank helps to eliminate pathogens and safeguards against the need for putting treatment in the water. Fish in the subfamily Mormyrinae have a high brain to body mass ratio, due to an expanded cerebellum used in their electroperception. The brain size to body weight ratio is even higher than that of humans; although unlike humans, the cerebellum is larger than the cerebrum (front brain). Related to this, they also hold the zoological record as having the brains that consume the most energy as a percentage of the body's metabolic rate of any animal (at around 60%).

Unfortunately, it can be a little prone to barbel infections/erosion, so it is of paramount importance that the fish are kept on a soft sand substrate (rather than gravel where waste can build up unseen) in order to protect these delicate sensory organs. Regular maintenance, including frequent partial water changes, should be carried out in order to keep these fish in good condition. Provide plenty of shady areas amongst driftwood, rocks, and areas of dense planting. Other peaceful species such as some of the smaller pencilfish, tetra, and rasboras make ideal tankmates, and their presence as dither fish in midwater will encourage the Corydoras out into view more often. Corys have the ability to breathe air intestinally, so a small gap should be left between the surface of the water and the cover slides in order for the fish to come up to the surface and take air in. It may do this numerous times per day.\nMay be confused with the similar-looking Brochis sp. C97, also from the Rio Nanay. However, in B. sychri, the head is longer and has a distinct angular profile, from dorsal surface to the top of the head above the eye, and then from there down to the snout. In some specimens, the snout may even look curved. Brochis sp. C97 has a much shorter and straighter head profile. sychri tends to have less well defined spotting compared to that of sp. C97, where the spots are much more distinct and fewer in number. Recent work on the previously enormous genus Corydoras has moved this species into Brochis, reflecting a close kinship despite some differences such as numbers of dorsal fin rays and a lack of senior synonyms used for the other groups/lineages of former Corydoras species.

However if you wish to raise a good number of fry, a small separate breeding aquarium should be set up for the purpose. This tank should also contain soft, acidic water, and the temperature should be set towards the high end of their preferred range. Prior to the spawning attempt, condition your fish on plenty of small meaty live or frozen foods. Clumps of Java moss or a few bunches of fine-leaved plants should be added to the breeding tank to give the fish somewhere to scatter their eggs, and very gentle filtration should be provided via an air-driven sponge filter. No dedicated lighting should be used, as eggs and fry tend to be light sensitive. Acclimatise a mix of both sexes across to the new tank very carefully during the evening, and in the morning, when sunlight hits the tank, spawning should commence. The parents should be removed immediately after spawning ceases as they will predate on the eggs. Some aquarists like to use a fine mesh in the tank so that the scattered eggs can fall to safety, away from the attention of the adult fish. Ideally try and keep the tank in darkness once eggs have been scattered, to protect them and the resultant sensitive young fry from being damaged by bright light. The eggs should hatch within 24-36 hours (temperature dependent) and the young will initially feed from their yolk sacs for a short time. Once free-swimming, microscopic foodstuffs such as infusoria/Paramecium should then be offered, followed by baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and microworm as they grow.",

        "breeding": "A separate unlit aquarium should be used for breeding purposes, as killifish eggs are light sensitive. This tank should be at least 18\" in length and like the main tank should be well covered. The water should be very soft (dH < 6 degrees, pH: <6.0) and the temperature kept within the preferred range. Higher temperatures may either cause the fish to cease spawning or result in the eggs not developing. A gentle air-driven sponge filter should be used, and the aquarium furnished with floating plants and spawning mops. Best results are obtained when the sides, back and base of the aquarium are covered with a dark material (black aquarium background is ideal) and the tank positioned somewhere that does not receive a lot of natural light. The use of Blackwater Extract can help to impart a tea-coloured tinge to the water, which also reduces the light level. Before the spawning attempt is made, it is a good idea to condition the males and females separately and in aquaria with a slightly lower temperature to that of the spawning tank. When ready, carefully acclimatise 1 male and 2 or 3 females across to the breeding aquarium. Spawning will take place near to the surface of the water, with eggs laid one at a time and which attach to the spawning mops or floating plants via an adhesive thread. Up to 50 eggs per female may be laid per day (although 20 is more of an average), with the spawning process typically occurring over two weeks. In most cases, the adults do not prey on the eggs if well fed, so they can be left in the spawning aquarium until you see fit to remove them. However, if you do wish to move the eggs to another rearing tank, they are surprisingly robust and can be hand-picked off the mops/plants. It is actually very wise to intervene after 5 days or so, removing the fish so that the females may be rested and brought back into condition. The addition of an anti fungal product to the tank containing the eggs is recommended at this point, and remember to keep the tank in darkness. If any eggs do start to fungus (turn white and fluffy) remove them as soon as possible with a pipette in order to prevent it from spreading to other eggs. The eggs can be expected to hatch after 14 days (temperature dependant) and once their yolk sacs have been consumed, the fry may be started on tiny foodstuffs such as infusoria. Ensure frequent partial water changes are carefully carried out (match the temperature, pH and hardness of the new water to that of the old).",

The aquarium should be mature and offer plenty of space for these active swimmers. Good filtration and a frequent partial water change regime are important as these fish (like all species from fast flowing freshwaters) will not tolerate an elevated nitrate level. Powerheads can be used to further create areas of decent current, and the output should be angled in such a way that it causes rippling at the surface of the water in order to keep dissolved oxygen levels high. Driftwood and cobbles can be used to decorate the aquarium, but do leave an open swimming space along the front of the tank. Plants are not necessary but may make the aquarium more aesthetically pleasing - choose robust species such as Anubias and Java Fern which can be attached to the d\u00c3\u00a9cor, and which can also withstand some current and are not too palatable to the fish. The Mackerel Barb is a gregarious species which should always be maintained in groups of 6 or more. Problems with aggression from the dominant fish may arise if they are kept in too low numbers. Tankmates must be fairly robust and enjoy the same cool, fast-flowing conditions; many of the medium sized barbs, danionins, Rhinogobius spp. gobies, Garras, and loaches (nemacheilids or coolwater botiids) make excellent companions. Avoid keeping with any shy species, especially those which would be easily outcompeted at feeding times by these boisterous fish.

Substrate choice could well be important for these egg scatterers, as some members of the closely related Barilius genus have modified pelvic fins and have been observed digging burrows in gravelly substrates during the breeding season. Therefore a substrate of smooth, rounded gravel would seem a prudent choice. It has been speculated that these fish are continuous spawners in much the same manner as rainbowfish, and if conditions are to their liking, will scatter eggs on a daily basis in season. Spawning is said to coincide with a slight increase in water temperature. If the aquarium has areas of dense cover (in addition to the much needed swimming space along the front of the tank) some of the eggs may get blown to safety by the current. However, the adult fish are voracious eaters and will think nothing of feasting on any eggs or fry, so a means of separating them will likely be necessary.",

Ideally there will be dark substrate and dense planting, with plenty of hiding places/territories amongst rocks, driftwood, coconut shells etc. Floating plant cover could be used to help diffuse the light.

Following translocation of the species to marshes near the village of Mahitsy (just north-west of Antananarivo) in the 1950's, it is now also widely established in the Betsiboka basin. The Madagascar Rainbowfish prefers slow-flowing streams that provide shade in the form of dense riparian vegetation. Here, the waters are soft and slightly acidic, and may be clear or tannin-stained. Juvenile fish are typically found in the shallows, with adults frequenting deeper waters.\nThe aquarium that houses these fish should be as spacious as possible due to their active nature, ideally at least 4ft long. The tank should be aquascaped with areas of dense planting (including floating species) and tangles of driftwood in order to provide plenty of shady hiding places. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement fairly gentle, and frequent partial water changes should be carried out in order to keep nitrate at a minimum. Madagascan Rainbowfish are generally very peaceful and somewhat gregarious, and as such, are best maintained in groups of 10 or more; this will not only make the fish less nervous, but will result in a more effective, natural-looking display. Rival males can sometimes become a little territorial with one another, but this should not be an issue if they are outnumbered by females and there are plenty of visual barriers amongst the decor.

        "breeding": "This species has been bred in the home aquarium. A separate good-sized softwater breeding tank should be set up with a small air-driven sponge filter (containing a mature sponge) to provide gentle circulation and filtration. A conditioned group (2-3 females, 1 male) should then be acclimatised across to the breeding aquarium, which should be furnished with plenty of fine-leaved plants/Java moss clumps/spawning mops. After a time, the male will display to a female and will begin to drive her over the plants, utilising the whole length of the tank. The relatively large eggs will be scattered over the plants a few at a time. These fish are known as 'continual spawners' which means that the spawning activity takes place over several days/weeks. This can present problems to the aquarist in that some adult fish may begin to consume the eggs as they are scattered, although this may not be a problem if the adults are kept well fed. However, many fishkeepers have found the eggs to be remarkably tough and have had great success in siphoning them out into another aquarium (containing matching water from the spawning tank) or else using spawning mops, which, when having caught a number of the eggs, can be moved to a separate tank (again with matching water) and replaced with a new mop, as and when each series of eggs are deposited. The eggs will usually hatch in 7-10 days (dependent on temperature) and once free-swimming, the tiny fry can be offered infusoria, moving onto larger foodstuffs such as baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) as they develop.",

Here these bottom-dwellers inhabit highly-oxygenated, whitewater rapids, with juveniles occupying the slow to moderately flowing marginal areas near the river banks, and adults observed under large flat rocks on the river bed. The aquarium should be mature, with a soft sand substrate and various pieces of smooth rockwork and bogwood arranged to create lots of shady caves and crevices. There should be brisk water movement and a high level of oxygenation, perhaps provided by a river-tank manifold or powerheads (in addition to the current generated by the filtration). These large bottom-dwellers require warmer than average water temperatures, and will not do well below 26 \u00b0C. Unless the aquarium is of vast proportions and provides a plethora of visual barriers, it is best to keep only one per tank, as these fish can be fiercely territorial with conspecifics and other bottom dwellers that occupy the same niche; indeed, it is not unknown for mature specimens to harass and kill other Magnum Plecs and similar species when kept in slightly cramped quarters, so choose tankmates cautiously and observe carefully. Companions should ideally occupy the middle and upper levels, be reasonably peaceful, and be able to thrive in warm, soft water with decent current - some of the medium sized characins or rheophilic cichlids are an excellent choice. Although these fish prefer a diet high in vegetable matter, they will not make any real impact on nuisance algae and must be offered a varied diet (see below). When they are actively grazing, they are actually searching for their natural food source - aufwuchs - which is a type of algae biofilm that contains small invertebrate life. Robust aquarium plants are rarely eaten, but larger fish may uproot them in their ongoing search for food items. Ensure that regular partial water changes are carried out as these catfish produce a fair amount of waste and will not tolerate an elevated nitrate level. May also be seen on sale as Mango Plec.",

These structures should be built with the purpose of creating many crevices for the fish to explore but constructed in such a way so as to keep the rocks stable if the fish start to dig around and underneath them. Although a substrate of coral sand or Aragonite is often recommended to help to keep the water hard and alkaline, Mbuna feel safer and show better colours over a darker substrate. The Aragonite or coral sand can always be placed into a mesh bag and kept inside the external filter for buffering purposes. It is best to keep one male with several females (keeping just one will result in continual harassment and possibly death) and these can be kept successfully alongside other outgoing Mbuna. Other Maylandia species are best avoided though, particularly those of similar appearance, as males will respond most aggressively towards look-a-likes as well as courting any females regardless of species.

They will circle each other in a head to tail manner a number of times, until the female deposits her eggs. These are deposited just one or two at a time and after doing so, she immediately turns around and picks them up. At the same time, the male will rotate so that he is almost on his side, at the same time shaking and extending his anal fin, releasing his milt. The female sees the egg spots on the male's anal fin and attempts to pick up those dummy eggs whilst she is picking up the real ones that she deposited, and at the same time taking in milt.

Soft, acidic water is essential, and this can be helped along with the addition of peat to the aquarium filter. Dark decor and plenty of bogwood, caves, and planting - including floating species - will all help these fish to feel secure. It is imperative that the tank has tight fitting coverslides as these fish are highly skilled jumpers; and do ensure there are no escape holes where equipment feeds into the tank (block any gaps with filter sponge). Marbled Hatchetfish are a timid shoaling species, which congregate in large numbers in nature; for this reason, they must be kept in groups of 6 or more (10+ is better) in order to feel secure and display natural behaviour. Tankmates must be small and peaceful, as Marbled Hatchetfish are easily intimidated. Good companions could include small peaceable tetras, pencilfish, Corydoras catfish, dwarf cichlids such as Apistogramma or Mikrogeophagus, and some of the smaller Loricariidae (suckermouth catfish). Much attention must be paid to water quality since Marbled Hatchets can be sensitive to elevated nitrates and swings in water chemistry.

Soft, acidic water is requisite, ideally filtered through peat. Following a lengthy courtship ritual, eggs will be laid on floating plants or plants growing near the water's surface. The parents will predate on the eggs/fry, so they should be acclimatised back to the main aquarium once spawning has ceased. The eggs should hatch between 24-36 hours, and the fry will become free-swimming a few days later. Begin feeding with infusoria and paramecium, moving on to baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) as they grow.

        "care": "Marbled Headstanders have a wide distribution across South America, encompassing many habitat types within the Amazon, Orinoco, Paraguay, and lower Parane River basins. These fish are frequently seen in the main river channels as well as quieter tributaries and heavily vegetated backwaters. During the rainy season, they will also enter areas that are temporarily inundated with water. Adult fish may be observed feeding on crustaceans, insects, worms, and plant matter, whereas the juvenile fish tend to take shelter in weedy margins. An aquarium for these fish must be spacious and biologically mature. There should be plenty of shelter in the form of driftwood pieces and dense, robust planting (Anubias or Microsorium tied to the decor is ideal), leaving an open swimming area along the front of the tank. Bright lighting should be diffused with floating plant cover, and dark background and substrate choices will help to bring out the beautiful markings of these fish. Marbled Headstanders are a gregarious species and should be maintained in groups of 8 or more. Keeping a good sized group is particularly important because as these fish mature, they become rather more independent and sometimes show moderate aggression towards their own kind. Larger groups will ensure that no one fish will continually bear the brunt of any antagonistic behaviour. However, these fish are still generally peaceful towards other species. Tankmates could include other medium-sized characins, catfish, cichlids, barbs, loaches, or rainbowfish. Avoid any small, docile species and those with long trailing fins, which might prove to be too much of a temptation. Marbled Headstanders are classified within the Family Anostomidae (headstanders), of which there are currently some 156 described species within 14 genera. Many species from this family swim at an oblique or head-down angle, hence the common family name of headstand. Abramites species are separated from other anostomids by the comparatively deeper body and presence of a prominent, post-pelvic median keel (a feature which is unique to the genus). A. eques , known from the Rio Magdalena drainage in Colombia, is, at present, the only other representative of the Abramites genus. These two species can be told apart as follows: the presence of 10-12 branched anal fin rays in A. hypselonotus (vs. 13-14 in A. eques), and 8 transverse bars distributed over the entire body in A. hypselonotus (vs. 5 transverse body bars in A. eques, with the anterior-most positioned underneath the dorsal fin).

Provide a large expanse of soft sand substrate with a number of shady hiding places amongst driftwood and rocky caves. Open expanses of sand in brightly lit tanks can be shaded by floating plants, or with large, broad-leaved plants such as Anubias tied to the decor. These fish will usually spend time sifting through the substrate for food and the addition of dried leaf litter would further help to emulate the natural environment. Loricaria are peaceful and should be kept in groups. Tankmates should be of a peaceful disposition and ideally swim above the substrate. The presence of such fish swimming around in open water may even encourage these reclusive catfish out into view a bit more. Observe carefully to ensure that none of the other fish are continually nipping away at the sometimes sedentary catfish. Good filtration along with frequent partial water changes are essential for keeping nitrogenous wastes to a minimum; however, the actual water flow within the aquarium should not be too excessive.",

Unfortunately, it can be a little prone to barbel infections/erosion, so it is of paramount importance that the fish are kept on a soft sand substrate (rather than gravel where waste can build up unseen) in order to protect these delicate sensory organs. Regular maintenance, including frequent partial water changes, should be carried out in order to keep these fish in good condition. Provide plenty of shady areas amongst driftwood, rocks, and areas of dense planting. Other peaceful species such as some of the smaller pencilfish, tetra, and rasboras make ideal tankmates, and their presence as \"dither fish\" in midwater will encourage the Corydoras out into view more often. Corydoras have the ability to breathe air intestinally, so a small gap should be left between the surface of the water and the cover slides in order for the fish to come up to the surface and take air in. It may do this numerous times per day. H. metae is sometimes confused with the similar looking H. melini. They can be told apart as follows: the oblique dark bar on metae terminates at the caudal fin base and does not extend onto the caudal peduncle or caudal fin. In melini, the oblique dark bar continues onto the caudal peduncle and lower part of the caudal fin.",

Unfortunately the eggs of this species are prone to fungus, so some fishkeepers like to add a small amount of methylene blue to the breeding tank.

Due to the large adult size of this fish (girth as well as length), an aquarium measuring at least 6\"\u2122 x 2\"\u2122 x 2\"\u2122 is required. A group of youngsters can be grown on in a 4ft tank, but in most cases they will eventually require separating into compatible pairs and rehoming into larger quarters. Powerful filtration should be provided at all times and partial water changes carried out 2 or 3 times per week. The tank itself should have a substrate of sand or small rounded gravel. Bogwood and rocks/slate can be used to create sheltered areas, but these should be made secure as these cichlids are more than capable of moving d\u00c3\u00a9cor around. Bonding pieces of rock together with aquarium grade silicon sealant prior to filling the tank is sensible. Plants are usually eaten or uprooted, but some aquarists have had success with well-rooted, established hardy motherplants which have had sturdy rocks placed around the stems to prevent uprooting, or else choose varieties such as Anubias sp. and Java Fern which can be tied to and cultivated on the decor. If this fails and plants are still desired, plastic or silk varieties will be the way to go. This is an aggressive species which is best maintained as an established male-female pair. They are intolerant of their own kind, but can usually be combined with other robust cichlids, if the aquarium is spacious. Not to be kept with small fish. Other Central/South American cichlids of a similar size and temperament make great tankmates, as do large armoured catfish.

        "care": "The exquisitely marked Mbu Puffer is a true giant among freshwater puffers. This fish must only be taken on if adult requirements can be met. Juveniles grow quickly and require a spacious aquarium with efficient filtration. Adults need huge quarters (minimum 8ft in length) with a good width to allow for their large turning circle. The filtration also needs to be scaled up to provide excellent clean water conditions for this fish, which has a large appetite and is a messy feeder. Highly oxygenated water must be provided at all times during the Mbu Puffers long life. Failure to do so can result in suffocation. Only one specimen should be kept per tank, and tankmates may or may not be kept, depending on the individual personality of the puffer. Some are placid fish which can be kept with even the smallest of fish species, whereas others are carnivorous killing machines that will attack anything else placed into the same tank. Many fishkeepers have found that keeping a small juvenile specimen with other fish species often helps the puffer tolerate other species when adult. It is not advisable to try introducing other fish to an aquarium containing a large adult Mbu Puffer if it has been housed away from other fish for many years. As this species tends to spend a good amount of time resting on the bottom of the aquarium - especially after a good meal - the substrate should consist of fine aquatic sand or small rounded gravel in order to protect the belly area. Robust decor can be used to furnish the aquarium, but be sure to leave an open swimming space in the central portion of the tank for when the puffer is feeling in a lively mood. Much caution must be exercised when carrying out maintenance on the Mbu Puffer aquarium as their powerful dentition is more than capable of cutting through veins, arteries and bones. Heaters should be housed externally (in a sump or thermofilters) wherever possible. As with other puffer species, this fish can inflate when frightened or cornered. It should never be provoked into doing so, and never above water where it can take on air, which can prove fatal. If moving a Mbu Puffer to larger quarters, the fish should be herded into a solid container under the water so as to remove the necessity of netting and lifting it clear of the water. To sum up: Unless you are prepared to invest time and money into the proper care of this species, it is really best avoided. However, if all needs can be met, these fish are very rewarding to keep. Not only are they something out of the ordinary, but they are long-lived and in time come to recognise their owner like a true 'pet'. May also be seen on sale as the Giant Freshwater Puffer.",

The female will expel a cluster of relatively large, adhesive eggs, which the male fertilises simultaneously. However, instead of depositing the eggs immediately, they stay attached to the genital opening of the female for a time before being set down singly or in small clumps amongst fine-leaved plants (or spawning mops). The eggs will hatch within 10-14 days, and is very much temperature dependent. Adult fish usually ignore the eggs, but they will predate on the fry, so unless the tank is densely planted to offer shelter to the young, it is best to either move the adults to another aquarium or else move the eggs to a small tank filled with water from the main tank. Once free swimming, the fry can be offered baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii), microworm, and powdered fry foods. Larger sized fry will predate on smaller sized fry, so do keep fry of different ages separate until there is less of a discrepancy in size.",

This nocturnal catfish is best housed in groups of 3 or more because of its gregarious nature; it is not advisable to attempt housing just two specimens together as they may constantly bicker. The more you can keep together, the better, as any arguing will be spread amongst the shoal. B. meesi should NEVER be added to aquariums containing small fish (Neon Tetra sized) as these will be eaten. Interestingly, in the wild, Brachyrhamdia are found amongst shoals of Corydoras which they mimic in colour and pattern. This is thought to afford them protection - being part of a larger shoal - and they also steal food from the substrate when the Corydoras are foraging. In the aquarium, some specimens can be a little nippy towards Corydoras (often accidental when feeding), so observe carefully if combining the two. Larger peaceful characins, rainbowfish, cyprinids, and medium sized Loricariids often make the best choices in tankmates. The aquarium itself should have a soft sandy substrate in order to protect the long sensory barbels. It should be decorated with a good amount of bogwood, rocks, pipes, and robust plants to provide shady areas and visual barriers, but you should also ensure a roomy swimming space in the central portion of the aquarium. The water should be well-oxygenated, and should have moderate current. Frequent partial water changes are a must. These fish are most comfortable in aquaria with subdued lighting, and the use of blue-moon type illumination is highly recommended so that you may observe a few hours of the nightly goings-on in your aquarium.

        "care": "The Melanzona Guppy originates from the brackish waters of swamps and clear, slow-flowing creeks with abundant vegetation and sandy-muddy substrates. Several wild colour forms of the male fish are recognised, the frequency and distribution of which is thought to depend upon various factors such as predation. The fish pictured above are red, yellow, and blue Melanzona variants which all sport two dark horizontal stripes along the flanks with vivid colouration in between. The fourth and fifth types (not shown here) are the Parae and the Immaculata. The Parae lacks the horizontal stripes, but instead has orange vertical stripes to the anterior half of the body and black vertical stripes to the posterior. The Immaculata variant is quite dull by comparison, with similar colouration to that of the female fish. It is estimated that the plain Immaculata morph represents around 50% of the male population, the Parae morph 40%, and the colourful Melanzona morphs just some 10%. Some suppliers have found it a little difficult to source genuine females, and it has been known for female guppies (P. reticulata) or female Endler's Livebearers (P. wingei) to be sent instead. True females have a diagnostic small, dark spot on the shoulder, absent in other species. Poecilia parae are small, but very active and require a spacious, mature aquarium. Although they are found in some freshwater habitats in the wild, most have been reported from brackish areas, and indeed, they tend to fare much better and have less health issues when maintained under slightly brackish conditions in captivity; they are also more likely to breed in such water. The tank should be heavily planted (with robust species that cope well in a slightly brackish environment), so that the fish feel secure and this will also provide hiding places for any tiny fry. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement gentle. Keep at least two females to every male in order to prevent any one female from becoming exhausted by the continual amorous intentions of the males. Plenty of plant cover - as mentioned above - will also aid in this respect, creating visual barriers so that fish may retreat and rest if need be. These fish are best maintained in a species-only aquarium, but small, peaceful tankmates that also appreciate mildly brackish conditions e.g. X-ray Tetras (Pristella maxillaris) could be kept alongside them if desired. Poecilia parae are considered quite delicate and are not suitable for beginners. In general, prices remain quite high for these sought-after livebearers.",
        "feeding": "Offer a good quality flake food plus small frozen foods such as daphnia, cyclops, brineshrimp and mosquito larvae. Will browse on some types of algae, likely for the microscopic life forms it contains.",
        "breeding": "Can be challenging. Although this species will breed in the main aquarium, adults do predate on the fry, so if you wish to raise a good number of young, it is best to set up a separate breeding aquarium where you can easily separate adults from new-born fry. A bare bottomed aquarium with lots of weighted plants is ideal, as they will provide shelter and can be easily moved about when needing to catch the adults and move them back to the main aquarium. Females are sexually mature at 8 months, and the males at 6 months. Once inseminated, a female will gestate for approximately 24 days, her gravid spot darkening all the while, after which time she will give birth to between 5 and 15 young. The fry should quickly seek shelter within the plants, and the adults should be moved back to the main aquarium. The young can be fed on powdered first foods designed specifically for fry, moving on to crushed flake, and baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii).\n  Some interesting studies have been carried out on the breeding of different colour morphs of these fish. The females are promiscuous and will mate with several males during a short period. In an aquarium with several different colour morphs, females tend to prefer mating with a red or yellow Melanzona male over the other varieties. If these are not present, the females then tend to favour the blue Melanzona over the Parae variant. And last of all, the lacklustre Immaculata is the least likely to be invited to mate with the female, and for this reason it has developed a stealth tactic in order to mate. The Immaculata male, which has similar colouration to the female and so is quite inconspicuous, waits until the female is being displayed to by a red or yellow Melanzona male, sneaks up next to the female whilst her attention is temporarily occupied and quickly mates with her, without her consent.\nIn an aquarium with adults continually present, it is more likely that blue Melanzona, Parae, and Immaculata fry will reach adulthood, as the red and yellow Melanzona fry are more easily seen and consequently preyed upon.",

Unlike the colonial Neolamprologus shell dwellers, males defend a patch that includes scattered shells inhabited by females within their own territories. Males often bury spare shells until a single female arrives in search of a new home. The females will spend much of their time in their individual shell; indeed it is here that each female will rest, retreat to when necessary, spawn and raise her young. The tank itself does not have to be particularly large for a pair but extra females will require their shells to be a significant distance apart. The aquarium must have a soft sand substrate in which the fish will bury their shells to hide their homes from rivals and predators. Offer a selection of widely-spaced empty snail shells (escargot shells are usually quickly approved of). Clean water is essential, so be sure to carry out plenty of regular partial water changes. These fish can be sensitive to changes in conditions, so it is best to ensure that the new water is of the same temperature as the tank, and should be added slowly. In larger aquaria, these fish may be kept with other small and relatively peaceful Tanganyikan cichlids, especially if adjacent habitats such as rockpiles are thoughtfully positioned, as these are fish of open sand habitat.

It tends to favour slow moving waters, and aside from the lakes, it occurs in the lower river valleys where there are calmer waters. This species is highly territorial and grows very large (length and girth), so a voluminous aquarium is required with powerful filtration to match. Provide a substrate of soft sand or small rounded gravel. Sizeable pieces of driftwood and rocks/slate can be used to create sheltered areas, but these should be made secure as these hefty cichlids are notorious diggers and they more than capable of moving d\u00c3\u00a9cor around. Bonding pieces of rock together with aquarium grade silicon sealant prior to filling the tank is sensible. As large quantities of substrate are likely to be bulldozed on a daily basis, plants cannot be cultivated. A guard should be fitted to the heater in order to protect it against breakages, or better still, opt for a canister filter that has a heater built in, so the element is not situated in the tank itself. Partial water changes should be carried out on a frequent basis to help keep nitrate to a minimum. This is an exceptionally aggressive species which is best maintained singly or as an established male-female pair. They are intolerant of their own kind, but can sometimes be combined with other robust cichlids, if the aquarium is particularly spacious (over 1000 litres) and has a plethora of visual barriers. Tankmates could include other Central/South American cichlids of a similar size and temperament, or large armoured catfish. However, if breeding does occur, expect a huge amount of aggression directed towards the other fish and be prepared to move the tankmates to another aquarium for their own safety. Sometimes the male can be very persistent when wanting to breed, and if the female is not receptive, he may harm her. So always observe carefully and have a tank divider on hand, should the need arise to separate an overly amorous male from his female. Ensure the aquarium has a tight fitting hood that is weighted down, as these heavyset fish are expert jumpers. Despite its large size and belligerent nature, this remains a popular fish with cichlid enthusiasts. Many Midas Cichlid keepers report how these intelligent fish quickly learn to recognise their owners, likening them to \"\u02dcpet dogs\"\u2122, such are their characters and responses to visual stimuli. Several tank-bred colour varieties exist including orange, red, white, white and orange, yellow, barred, and piebald.\nSince their first importation many related species have been discovered, combined with suspected crossing with Red Devils (A. labiatus), this means that fish without location data are often labelled 'Middevils' that hints at their possible hybrid origin.",
        "feeding": "Omnivorous. This species requires a balanced diet in order to retain good colours. Slow sinking pellets/sticks, frozen foods such as Mysis shrimp, krill, chopped cockle, chopped mussel meat and prawns will all be taken with much enthusiasm. Be sure to provide a vegetable component to the diet, such as spinach, kale, lettuce and cucumber.",
        "breeding": "This species has been bred in the home aquarium, but it can be difficult establishing a compatible pair. Simply placing a male and female together is unlikely to work and may have disastrous consequences. It is far better to obtain a group of juveniles and grow them on, letting a pair form naturally from the group. However, you would need to have a plan in place for rehoming the remaining fish. Even then, if the female is not receptive, the male may end up killing her, so always have a tank divider on hand should things get violent. When ready to spawn, the nuchal hump on both the male and female will increase in size and their colours will intensify. The courtship dance is a vigorous affair, with much mouthing and tail slapping. Again, have the tank divider handy in case things get a bit out of control. Eggs are usually deposited on a vertical piece of slate, a flat piece of driftwood, or in a rocky cave. Up to 1000 eggs will be laid/fertilised, and these can be expected to hatch within 72 hours. The parents will then move the wrigglers to a pre-dug pit. They will become free-swimming after a further few days when their yolk sacs are used up, and can be offered baby brineshrimp or crushed flake. At this point, it would be wise to separate the male from the female using the tank divider, as the male will be hyper-aggressive in defence of the fry. If carrying out maintenance on the tank, he is quite likely to attack your hands, so be very careful. Parental care usually continues for around 6 weeks. Please be aware that a bonded pair may reproduce on a regular basis, and always in exceptionally large numbers. Therefore, it is important to consider whether you should really allow this species to reproduce in the home aquarium, and should have a homing plan in place for the potentially hundreds, if not thousands, of juvenile fish (that are going to attain a substantial size), which are going to quickly overwhelm an aquarium. Once the fry have been removed from the aquarium, observe the adults carefully as the male may attempt to spawn again immediately, and the female may not be ready.",

At present, the vast majority of limited exports are of wild fish, but it is hoped that the aquaculture industry will start to breed these commercially on a large scale in order that it will not only make this fish more available to hobbyists, but also to safeguard the wild population. The Misool Rainbowfish is classified as being of Low Risk on the IUCN Redlist of endangered species. This is because of the perceived threat to the natural habitat by the development and destruction of forests for traditional agriculture, logging, and fire by an ever-increasing population. Misool Island itself is composed of sedimentary rock with large areas of limestone. It is therefore to be expected that the native clear water streams of the Misool Rainbowfish, which run through the lowland rainforests of the island, are of a relatively hard and alkaline composition. These charming fish should be maintained in groups of 6 or more, due to their naturally shoaling nature. The aquarium should be at least 4ft long, as this is an active species that needs swimming space. As with many other Rainbowfish species, the juveniles can look comparatively drab to the absolutely stunning adult fish, and so are all too often overlooked in the shops.

T. moorii has been used as a convenient label for a number of fishes in need of classification and many of these forms are now known as Tropheus sp. 'Black' or T. sp. 'Red' together with their location or common name. As hybridisation may occur, it's best to keep Tropheus in groups of their own kind and these should be large in number to spread the aggression. Housing 15 or more of these feisty fishes requires a large aquarium and this should be 1.5m or more in length to allow individuals to avoid one another. Smaller groups inevitably dwindle as harassment and bullying proves too much for the females and weaker males. It is important that the entire group is added at the same time to avoid the aggression which would otherwise be directed towards any newcomers. When adding large numbers of fish in this manner, it's important that the filtration is cycled and capable of handling the waste load. Given the investment involved, the use of a matured filter and bacterial inoculation with products such as Microbe Lift are strongly advised. As always, water quality should be very carefully monitored over the first few weeks. Excellent water quality must be maintained at all times, with partial water changes carried out at least once or twice a week and this may require the addition of buffers to ensure the high pH and carbonate hardness levels required. Strong water movement will ensure high oxygen levels and helps to keep the fish fit and active.\nAlthough Tropheus can be kept in fairly bare aquaria, several separate piles of rocks should be created (instead of a continuous rocky reef) so that individuals can more easily evade one another thanks to broken sight lines. Lighting should be bright to encourage the growth of algae over the decor, which these herbivores will enjoy browsing upon. Sharp rocks (such as lava rock) should not be used as they can cause damage to the mouths of these fishes as they graze.\nAside from a tendency to kill one another best controlled by keeping them in big groups, diet is the other major factor in successful care. These fishes are very prone to bloating caused by excessive quantities of rich food and this should be considered when mixing them with other species. Prospective tank mates should be able to thrive on the same diet and this may limit selection.\nAs many as 40 different regional/colour forms may be seen labelled as T. moorii and these should all be kept apart to avoid hybridisation complicating things even further!",
        "feeding": "A staple diet based on algae such as spirulina is recommended, together with occasional feeds of high-fibre frozen foods such as Daphnia, Mysis and Cyclops. Avoid feeding these fishes too generously. Fine sand substrates may be useful in aiding gut health by providing beneficial indigestible matter.",
        "breeding": "Males should be outnumbered with females because of their constant desire to spawn, and this harassment (which can be quite intense) will then be spread, so that no one fish bears the brunt of the males' continual amorous attention. The trickiest part of conditioning females is ensuring they have sufficient opportunity to avoid being pestered by males. Properly kept, breeding occurs naturally and females mouth brood a small clutch (<20) of very large eggs for three weeks or more. Maternal care continues a little longer and fry are capable of feeding inside their mother's mouth. Young fish are preferentially released in shallow water with rich algal growth and fewer predators - having rockwork reaching the surface or piles of small stones will provide suitable areas.",

Here, it is found in a variety of habitats, but most commonly encountered in shallow, slow-moving tributaries over sandy or muddy substrates. This beautiful bottom-dweller grows very large, and requires a voluminous aquarium with powerful filtration to match. The length and width of the tank is generally much more important than the height, giving this fish as much floor space as possible and allowing for the fish to turn freely with the long tail. The aquarium must be biologically mature before adding this species. A soft sand substrate is essential, as stingrays spend the majority of their time on the bottom and like to bury themselves in the substrate from time to time (with just the eyes protruding), as well as searching out food items on the sand. When resting on or in the substrate, small openings located on the top of the head (known as spiracles) draw water into the gill chambers to facilitate oxygen exchange. Decor is not overly necessary for stingrays, as a large expanse of sand is much more important for their continued wellbeing. Some tangles of driftwood and smooth rocks could be incorporated, but these must be very secure, and not take up very much of the floor space. The Motoro Stingray is a voracious eater that produces a lot of waste, and requires continuous excellent water conditions. To this end, filtration must be powerful and the water well-oxygenated. A frequent partial water change regime is absolutely essential as this fish will not tolerate an elevated nitrate level. Several huge canister filters can be employed, but sump filtration may be more prudent as then equipment such as heaters can be kept in the sump and out of the main tank where they would be very easily damaged. Lighting should be fairly dim, as these fish do not enjoy bright illumination. Stingrays are not particularly sociable and are best maintained either singly, as a male/female pair, or one male with a group of females. Male fish can be rather rough with one another, so it's best to house only one male per tank. Tankmates (if desired) must be chosen very carefully, as stingrays are highly proficient predators; however, despite this, they will fail to thrive if housed with boisterous or territorial species. The best companions would be large, passive midwater or surface-dwelling fish. Avoid keeping with Loricariids (suckermouth catfish) as within the confines of the home aquarium, there are many documented instances of them attaching themselves and rasping away at the flat, disc-shaped body of stingrays, causing injury. Ensure the tank has tight fitting coverslides that are weighted down, as these fish are expert jumpers. Take extra care when offering food, as it is not unusual for the stingray to swim up and breach the water's surface during all the excitement of a feeding frenzy. Like all species from this genus, P. motoro is equipped with one or more barbed spines that are found on the dorsal surface of the middle section of the tail. These spines are coated with an extremely toxic mucus that inflicts very painful wounds, and tends to be employed in defence or when the fish is alarmed. Always handle stingrays with much care. When these fish need to be moved, they should always be herded into a solid container, rather than using a net. If you are stung by a Potamotrygon spp. stingray, seek immediate medical help for pain relief and to ensure no part of the stinger remains in the wound (this could lead to a serious secondary infection). These fish shed their stingers every 2-3 months and new ones grow in their place. Be aware that discarded stingers can remain venomous for some time, so exercise caution when carrying out tank maintenance. This fish is long-lived (20+ years) and a fascinating species to look after, but it is quite the commitment so do ensure that all of its specific care requirements can be met before purchase. May also be seen on sale as the Ocellate River Stingray or the South American Freshwater Stingray.",
        "feeding": "Juveniles can be offered bloodworm, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, Mysis shrimp, and chopped krill. Adults should be offered larger foodstuffs such as cockles, mussels, prawns, river shrimp, silversides, whitebait, and pieces of white fish flesh. Stingrays have a fast metabolism and require feeding 2-3 times per day (which is why powerful filtration and a strict water change regime is absolutely essential).",
        "breeding": "The Motoro Stingray has been bred in the home aquarium, and like other Potamotrygon spp. reproduces via a breeding strategy known as matrotrophic viviparity. Stingrays take many years to become sexually mature, so patience may be required, particularly if starting out with fairly young fish. As the courtship ritual can be a somewhat violent affair, it is essential that the female is larger than the male so that she can defend herself adequately from the male's advances, which includes incessant chasing and rough biting. Always observe carefully just in case the female is not receptive, as the fish may need separating for safety reasons. When ready to spawn, the pair briefly go belly-to-belly, with the male inserting one of his claspers into the female's cloaca, fertilisation taking place internally. Gestation usually lasts 2-3 months, and a typical sized litter would number between 1 and 8 (the young often referred to as 'pups'). The pups develop inside the mother, nourished by secretions from her villi (umbilical filaments), and when they are born, they are fully-formed miniatures of the adults. It is essential that the female receives good, nutritious feedings during the gestation period as she will expend a lot of energy when carrying and nourishing her pups. Once the pups are born, it may be best to move them carefully to other quarters, as although predation is rare, it is not unheard of. There is also the matter of the water becoming very clouded during the birth when bodily fluids are released, so the main tank will require a large water change (which the pups might be sensitive to). The pups will feed from their yolk sacs for the first week or so, after which time they can be offered a variety of small meaty frozen foods. A compatible pair of stingrays may attempt to breed regularly, and as this can be rather hard on the female, it may be best to separate the pair after every couple of litters, in order for her to recover properly and have a rest from such an energy-intensive process.",

This robust species has been released in over 90 countries worldwide, and unfortunately most report adverse ecological effect due to its adaptability to so many environmental conditions, along with its piscivorous nature and extreme fecundity. Despite such concerns, this drab coloured cichlid remains (perhaps somewhat surprisingly) a popular ornamental fish for voluminous aquaria, and in warmer climes, outdoor tropical ponds. Due to the large adult size of this semi-aggressive fish, an aquarium measuring at least 7\"\u2122 x 2.5\"\u2122 x 2.5\"\u2122 is required. A group of youngsters can be grown on in a smaller tank, but in most cases they will eventually require splitting up and rehoming into larger quarters. These cichlids are big eaters, so an efficient filtration system along with regular water changes are very important in order to keep them healthy. Anything green and leafy will be regarded as a tasty snack, so if plants are desired they will have to be plastic and well weighted down or secured to the d\u00c3\u00a9cor. Large sized gravels/pebbles should be avoided as bigger specimens are capable of throwing it against the glass; it is best to choose sand or the smallest sized gravel available. These fish like to dig and rearrange the d\u00c3\u00a9cor, so ensure that any large structures are stable, and definitely make use of a heater guard. With regards to tankmates, never attempt to keep these alongside small fish. It may be possible to house a Mozambique Mouthbrooder with other cichlids of a similar size and temperament in an XXXL tank with plenty of visual barriers amongst the d\u00c3\u00a9cor (and introduced simultaneously when all fish are juvenile), but more often than not, these fish do best on their own or with large armoured catfish. If you happen to obtain a compatible pair, it is best to house them in a species-only tank, as much aggression would be shown towards outsiders if breeding occurs in an aquarium containing other fish - and this could all too quickly result in injuries or worse. Several colour varieties have been tank-bred from the original wild green form, and are sometimes available in the trade. May also be seen on sale as Mozambique Tilapia.",

But do ensure they receive ample vegetable matter such as blanched spinach, kale, lettuce, cucumber etc, and do not feed high protein foods too often.",
        "breeding": "Maternal mouthbrooders. When ready to spawn, the male excavates a pit in the substrate and entices the female to mate with him.

At this point, the male plays no further part in the reproductive process. The female broods the eggs in her mouth, circulating water over them via careful chewing motions made with the jaws. The eggs hatch inside the female's mouth within 3-5 days, but the fry are not released until days 10-14. Following release, the female cares for the fry for a further 3-4 weeks, letting them enter her mouth again if there is a threat to their safety. The fry grow at quite a pace and are sexually mature within 9 months. In the wild, a single female can have 3 to 4 broods a year, each with several hundred young.",

        "care": "Mudskippers are amphibious fish that are known from intertidal habitats in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions. As the name suggests, they use their modified pectoral and pelvic fins to walk (hop) on land. They also have the ability to breathe via cutaneous respiration - that is through the skin and lining of the mouth and throat - but to do this they have to stay moist, hence the need for a humid or wet environment. In addition, they also have enlarged opercula (gill chambers) which allow them to retain a bubble of air, which also aids breathing whilst out of water. To maintain body temperature, they dig tunnels in the soft silty substrate, and these burrows also afford them protection from predators. Mudskippers sit within the Order Gobiiformes, Family Oxudercidae, Subfamily Oxudercinae. There are currently 10 oxudercine goby genera recognised, of which Boleophthalmus, Periophthalmodon, Periophthalmus, Scartelaos, and Zappa are accepted as true Mudskippers. The genus that we are detailing here, Periophthalmus, is the most speciose with 19 described species, found in estuaries, lagoons, mangrove swamps, and mudflats. Several of these species are seen regularly in the aquatics trade. Mudskippers require a paludarium or an aquarium that has a vastly dropped water level with decor and salt-tolerant plants extending above the water line, leading on to dry land. Approximately 2/3 of the layout should be land, and 1/3 of it brackish water. They absolutely MUST have an area where they can climb free of the water, where they will spend time basking in the humid air. The terrestrial area should be sandy (which will allow them to dig burrows) with plenty of roots, marginal/terrestrial plants, and rocky caves, and the water area should be heated and filtered as normal. The heater should be protected with a heater guard to prevent burns if the Mudskippers lay against it. Turtle docks/rafts can also be very useful additions for this type of set up, but never forego a large expanse of sand substrate above the water line for burrowing purposes. A tight fitting lid is essential to keep humidity in, and be sure to block all holes where equipment feeds into the tank (sponges are useful for this purpose), as Mudskippers are great escape artists. Regular partial water changes should be carried out on the water area as you would do in an aquarium, in order to keep nitrate at a minimum. Be sure to use a quality marine salt for water changes, and monitor salinity carefully with a hydrometer. All Periophthalmus spp. are territorially aggressive, although the level of aggression does vary from species to species. Males of many of the larger species, such as the West African Mudskipper, P. barbarus, (a species commonly traded and recognised by its large 25cm/10\" size and bright blue dorsal fins) can be so aggressive and intolerant of their own kind in the confines of a paludarium, that they can only be kept alone - even in spacious quarters. Topping out at 20cm (8\"), the Silver Barred Mudskipper (P. argentilineatus) is another sizeable species that is regularly traded, but is nowhere near as aggressive as P. barbarus. P. argentilineatus may be recognised by the attractive silver vertical stripes along the flanks. However, undoubtedly the most popular species with aquarists is the Indian Dwarf Mudskipper (P. novemradiatus). This species is ideal for the home paludarium on account of its small size (6.5cm/2.6\") and less territorial nature, which means it can be maintained in groups in spacious housing. Mudskippers should not be combined with fishes, amphibians, or invertebrates, and never try to mix more than one species of Mudskipper with another.",
        "feeding": "Offer a variety of meaty foods including bloodworm, white mosquito larvae, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, Mysis shrimp, finely chopped krill/clam etc. Some will take dried foods such as flake.

        "care": "Neolamprologus multifasciatus may be small, but what they lack in size, they more than make up for in personality! In the wild, a harem of females is served by a single male. His colony will be made up of several small empty Neothauma tanganyicense snail shells, in which he entices females to come and take up residence. In certain areas of the lake, these snail shells are found in the most enormous drifts. They do not disintegrate because of the hardness of the water, and masses of colonies of these shell-dwellers are found living side by side. The females will spend much of their time in their individual shell; indeed it is here that each female will rest, retreat to when necessary, spawn and raise her young. Each male will defend his territory of shells and females, all making use of the very natural cover. The tank itself does not have to be particularly large for a small colony, but it must have a soft sand substrate and plenty of empty snail shells on offer (escargot shells are especially approved of). The fish will dig around and under the snail shells so that they eventually end up on the tank floor rather than on top of the sand itself, and watching them excavate these little depressions and move sand about the aquarium is fascinating. These fish should never be kept without snail shells (or substitutes such as small PVC elbow tubes). Once spawning has taken place (see below for details), several generations of fish may live together. Needless to say, the more fish present, the more shells will be needed. Placing a piece of slate on the base of the tank before adding the substrate will avoid the fish exposing the bare glass through their enthusiastic home improvements. Unfortunately, planting is not always very successful due to the uprooting behaviour of these fish but shells can be positioned far from any planting or rock piles in order to minimise disruption and allow cohabitation with rock dwelling species such as Julidochromis or Neolamprologus if space allows. Fishes moving outside the perimeter of the territory are usually ignored, making it possible to combine 'Multis' with many other species that appreciate alkaline water and swim high in the water column. \nThis species may be confused with the closely related N. similis, which has a more extensive pattern of bands.",

Sometimes, an early indicator that a pair is getting ready to spawn is an increase in digging activity around the shell. The eggs (typically numbering 5-20) will be laid and fertilised within the shell, and afterwards, the female stays just inside the shell entrance and guards them. At this time, the male usually defends the perimeter of the shell pit/crater against any possible predators (whether they are present in the tank or not). After 7-10 days, the fry will begin to venture out of the shell, darting quickly back in if they feel threatened. Eventually, they will venture further, and are ignored by the adults in the tank. Fry are tolerated within the shell cluster, the raising of which are extremely rewarding. Do remember to add new shells as starter homes, or thin the colonies out occasionally.",

Unlike their distant cousins, they are easy to house and do not require enormous tanks or ponds. Musk Turtles are also known as Stinkpots due to the defensive odour wild specimens give off when captured. Tame captive specimens do not use this trick unless very stressed, although they still don't appreciate being handled unnecessarily. As with all pets, we would recommend washing your hands thoroughly after dealing with these animals.\nMusk Turtles are very aquatic and spend most of their time walking or resting underwater. As inhabitants of the shallows, they don't tend to swim in open water, preferring to climb about on submerged structures. When young, they need warm, shallow water and even when adult they need easy access to the water's surface due to their limited swimming ability. Whilst fairly hardy, all turtles require good water quality and a small internal filter laid on its side will provide adequate filtration for hatchlings. Larger animals may need more extensive filtration but make sure that excessive water movement is avoided for these slow-moving creatures. Regular partial water changes are essential to control waste levels and algae growth. Although they do not bask as much as many other turtles, they still require access to a dry haul-out area where they can warm themselves and gain exposure to UVB lighting. This thorough drying is vital to prevent fungal problems and to achieve a proper body temperature to enable digestion. Rapidly growing babies are creatures of the warm shallows and should be kept in water heated to around 25c with a basking lamp providing a hot spot of around 35c. As they mature they can be kept in cooler conditions - adults are happy at room temperature as long as basking facilities are provided and will thrive if provided with secure outdoor accomodation during the spring and summer. Raised feature ponds, where they can be easily seen and monitored, are very suitable but ensure that any such facilities are securely covered to prevent escape or predation. \nAlthough these are not large turtles, a tank 60cm (24\") in length should be the minimum for hatchlings, with 100cm (39\") adequate for adults. Floor area is more important than water depth and should be as generous as possible. As well as robust (or expendable) plants, bogwood and rockwork should be used to provide an interesting environment for your pets. Compatibility may be an issue with mature specimens and males will generally prove intolerant of one another. All specimens for sale are captive-bred and as such free of parasites and health problems seen in wild-caught animals. Properly cared for, they will live a long and healthy life and are not a commitment to be rushed into on impulse - these turtles can easily live for twenty years or more.",
        "feeding": "At all stages of their life these turtles are primarily carnivorous and youngsters will thrive on a varied diet consisting of shrimp and worm-based frozen and live foods, aquatic snails and chopped fish. A good quality pellet to ensure balanced nutrition and adequate levels of calcium can be introduced as they grow and can provide the staple diet once readily accepted. Both adults and young will eat fish and should therefore be housed away from non-turtle tankmates. To avoid excessive pollution it is best to feed little and often. Note that with many turtles, excessive feeding can lead to unhealthy growth rates and cause shell deformities in extreme cases. Adults may eat some plant material and given that they prefer weedy habitats in the wild, it is a good idea to use a hardy plant such as Egeria or Elodea to provide shelter and an occasional dietary supplement.",
        "breeding": "In the wild most populations encounter colder winters and may require a cool winter rest for best results. Females will bury their eggs in typical turtle style and require a deep substrate in a suitably equipped dry area to do so.

Higher temperatures produce female hatchlings, which are more compatible as adults and hence preferred. Given the long lifespan of these animals and the availablity of adults in need of rescue, think long and hard before producing any hatchlings that you don't intend to keep.",

Here they find sanctuary amongst submerged roots and the crevices of rocks, never straying too far from cover.\nThe aquarium should be large, with plenty of hiding places amongst driftwood and rocky caves, and flower pots laid on their side are also much appreciated. If plants are desired, choose tough species such as Java Fern (Microsorum sp.) or Anubias sp. tied onto the wood, as plants rooted in the substrate will probably be dug up if in the wrong place. Neets are highly aggressive when breeding, and are therefore best maintained alongside robust tankmates which can either tolerate their aggression, or midwater shoaling fishes which can outmaneuver them. They will think nothing of attacking fish several times larger than themselves in defence of their young and as they're often found alongside species such as Red devils and Midas cichlids (Amphilophus) in the wild, their parental instincts compel them to tackle any threat. When not breeding, they largely ignore non-cichlid tankmates.\nTo warn other fish to keep their distance, breeding fish reverse their colour pattern and become very dark with a white bar and bright white eyes. In this colouration they are some of the most striking small Central American cichlids available. This white bar/black body combined with their shape and algae eating habits have led to an alternative common name of Poor man's Tropheus. Decades after being given this name, they are now far more rare and often more expensive than Tropheus duboisi.",

The female then takes responsibility for tending to the eggs, whilst the male patrols the perimeter and vigorously protects them from intruders. The eggs should hatch within 3 days, and the wrigglers moved to a pre-dug pit in the substrate, where they will remain until the yolk sac is absorbed (usually a further 3 or 4 days). At this point, the large, free-swimming fry can be offered baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and crushed flake foods. The adult fish are excellent parents, with care continuing for several weeks.",

Their antagonistic behaviour is not so much of an issue in the wild, where fish can easily move from one territory to another, but it can certainly present problems within the confines of the aquarium. Provide a sandy substrate along with plenty of nooks and crannies formed from pebbles, rocks, pieces of slate, flowerpots turned on their sides, and tangles of driftwood - ensuring that lines of sight are broken up. Areas of dense planting will be appreciated, but as this species likes to dig, it is best to stick to robust species that can be tied on and trained to grow on the decor, such as Anubias spp. and Java Fern (Microsorum spp.) plus floating varieties. Filtration should be efficient but water movement not too strong, and frequent partial water changes should be carried out to keep nitrate levels at a minimum. Neon Jewel Cichlids are best maintained in pairs, but picking out a male and a female will not guarantee they are compatible, and the stronger fish may kill off the weaker individual. It is better to purchase a group of 6+ youngsters and allow a natural pair to form, before rehoming the others. Tankmates, if desired, must be chosen with care as Neon Jewel Cichlids become highly aggressive when spawning, but good choices could include some of the larger African tetra species (Alestes, Arnoldichthys, Bathyaethiops, Phenacogrammus spp. etc) or Synodontis catfish.

The water should be neutral to slightly soft and acidic with the temperature set towards the higher end of the preferred range, and there should be plenty of flat rocks such as slate for the female to deposit her eggs on to. The best way to obtain a compatible pair is to purchase a group of young fish and allow them to pair off naturally. Once a pair has formed, the remaining fish should be moved to another tank (this includes tankmates) for their own safety. A large, cool water change often triggers the fish into spawning, at which time the female will turn a deep red colour. The pair will select a spawning site and clean it thoroughly. Spawning is an active affair and the male can be very vigorous in his pursuit of the female. Observe them carefully in case she shows signs that she is unwilling, as the eager male has been known to harass the female to death if she is not ready. Spawning occurs in much the same manner as many other cichlid species, with the female depositing a line of eggs on the cleaned spawning site, then moving away to be replaced by the male who fertilises them. Up to 500 eggs may be laid, and these will hatch within 48 hours. During this time, the female takes care of the eggs, whilst the male fiercely guards the perimeter. Once the eggs hatch, the entire brood will be moved into a pre-dug pit near to the spawning site, and may be moved again to other pits before they become free-swimming (usually a further 3-5 days). At this point, they can be offered baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) or microworm. The parent fish will continue to care for the young for 4 weeks or so, after which point the fry should be moved to another aquarium as the parents are quite likely to spawn again.",

This can present problems to the aquarist in that some adult fish may begin to consume the eggs as they are scattered, although this may not be a problem if the adults are kept well fed. However, many fishkeepers have found the eggs to be remarkably tough and have had great success in siphoning them out into another aquarium (containing matching water from the spawning tank) or else using spawning mops, which, when having caught a number of the eggs, can be moved to a separate tank (again with matching water) and replaced with a new mop, as and when each series of eggs are deposited.

Here it inhabits lakes and rivers with slow to moderate current. This beautiful species is best maintained as a compatible pair, and they should be provided with a mature aquarium that is at least 4ft long. Much larger quarters will be necessary if you wish to keep them alongside other cichlids. There should be a soft sandy substrate and numerous hiding places/visual barriers created from tangles of driftwood, rocky caves, flowerpots, and hardy planting (Anubias sp. or Java Fern tied to the wood). Filtration should be efficient but water movement not too vigorous. This species is especially sensitive to the build-up of pollutants, so small frequent water changes are a must to help keep nitrogenous waste to a minimum. The Nicaragua Cichlid is relatively peaceful - as far as large Central American cichlids go - although it is still rather territorial, especially when breeding. Good tankmates include large armoured catfish, and sizeable barbs or characins. Do not house with small fish or with any exceptionally aggressive species. Several different colour forms exist, depending on original collection location. May also be seen on sale as the Macaw Cichlid or Spilotum, and are often referred to simply as \"Nics\".",

In the wild, these fish spawn in tunnels dug some 10-20\" into clay river banks, which help keep the eggs in one place despite the water currents. Prior to spawning, the colouration of the fish will intensify and they will choose a suitable spawning site - usually a depression dug in the substrate or in a cave. Unusually for a cichlid, the eggs are non-adhesive, and the result is that in the home aquarium, the parents spend quite some time chasing after them on the substrate and returning them to the nest (this would likely not be such a problem in the wild where the eggs are confined to a tunnel). The female takes on primary brood care, whilst the male patrols the general perimeter. The eggs, which may number up to 400, should hatch within 3-4 days, and the fry should be free-swimming just a few days later. Offer them baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and crushed flake, moving on to larger foodstuffs as they grow. Both male and female exhibit excellent parental care, and it is important not to separate the young from the adults too quickly, otherwise the male may decide he wants to spawn again and the female may not be ready, in which case he will show much aggression.",

If a female is receptive, she will accompany him to the pre-dug pit, and they will circle each other. As the female deposits eggs, she immediately takes them into her mouth and then nudges the vent of the male fish with her mouth, signalling to him to release his milt, fertilising the eggs. Males can be quite hard on mouthbrooding females, so it is best to move the female to another aquarium at this point. She will mouthbrood the eggs for 9-11 days, at which point the free-swimming fry are released. The young will start foraging for food straight away and can be offered baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii), microworms, or crushed flake as soon as they are released.

This secretive black and white catfish requires a mature aquarium with a soft sand substrate and plenty of shady hiding places amongst the crevices in driftwood pieces. Although plants are largely absent from its natural habitat, they can be very useful in shading out bright lighting and providing additional hiding places. Robust species such as Java Fern and Anubias sp. are good choices, as they often cope well with moderate current, which Ninja Woodcats prefer. This peaceful, gregarious species is best kept in groups of 5 or more, and is safe with most community fish; however, adults will predate on very tiny fish or small fry, so choose tankmates with care. Largely nocturnal, they will spend much of the day hidden, but can usually be coaxed out with bloodworms, for which they will quickly emerge and feed in quite a frenzy! Some aquarists like to add a blue moon light to the aquarium, that switches on just before the main lights turn off, so that they can view the natural behaviour of these catfish for a few hours during the evening. Regular partial water changes are essential as, like other riverine fish, this species is intolerant of the build up of nitrogenous waste within the aquarium. Interestingly, there is a very similar-looking species known from Lago Balbina, Amazonas, Brazil, which is sometimes seen in the trade under the Tatia sp. aff. musaica or Tatia sp. \"ninja\" nametags. This fish sports an additional white blotch underneath the dorsal fin and displays a slightly different tail pattern.

Like other Woodcats, fertilisation takes place internally, the male using his modified anal fin like a gonopodium to deliver his milt.

His territory will include several small empty Neothauma tanganyicense snail shells, in which he entices females to come and take up residence. Unlike the colonial shell dwellers, males defend a patch that includes scattered shells inhabited by females within their own territories. Males often bury spare shells until a single female arrives in search of a new home. The females will spend much of their time in their individual shell; indeed it is here that each female will rest, retreat to when necessary, spawn and raise her young. The tank itself does not have to be particularly large for a pair but extra females will require their shells to be a significant distance apart. The aquarium must have a soft sand substrate in which the fish will bury their shells to hide their homes from other cichlids. Offer a selection of widely-spaced empty snail shells (escargot shells are usually quickly approved of). Clean water is essential, so be sure to carry out plenty of regular partial water changes. These fish can be sensitive to changes in conditions, so it is best to ensure that the new water is of the same temperature as the tank, and should be added slowly.

The water in the native habitat is very soft and acidic, and stained a tea colour from the tannins in the decaying leaves and wood.\nThe home aquarium should be mature, with a dark substrate and background and with plenty of plant cover - both rooted and floating - in order for these peaceful mid-to-top-dwelling fish to feel secure. Filtration should be efficient but water movement gentle. These fish are best maintained in groups of at least 10, and more than this wherever possible. Dominant males may occasionally bicker with one other, but providing there is a good network of hiding places/visual barriers for them to retreat into if necessary, no harm should ensue. Keeping more females than males will also help to reduce any minor aggression-related problems. In the wild, these fish are found alongside many other small characins, including representatives from the Copella, Hemigrammus, Hyphessobrycon, and Paracheirodon genera. Dwarf cichlids from the Apistogramma or Mikrogeophagus genera could also be considered as good tankmates, as well as Corydoras catfish and small loricariids. Choose companions wisely as Pencilfish can be fairly timid and will hide away and refuse to feed if tankmates are too boisterous. If unfussy about creating an exact biotope, some of the smaller Rasbora and Boraras species from Asia would get along well with the pencilfish, as would Kuhli loaches (Pangio spp.). As with other Nannostomus, N. unifasciatus assume a cryptic colour overnight so may look a little pale when the lights first switch on. This species also swims in an oblique position with tail slightly down and head angled towards the water's surface, a trait that, amongst congeners, is shared only by N. eques (the Hockeystick Pencilfish). Acclimatisation should be carried out very carefully, and be sure to keep up with small regular water changes to keep nitrogenous wastes at a minimum. Tight fitting coverslides are a must, as these fish are capable of jumping from an open topped aquarium.\nThis species is often imported in mixed batches alongside the Hockeystick pencil (N. eques). With such a broad distribution, it is likely that this fish is actually more than one species and DNA work seems to suggest that there's a few cryptic species waiting to be discovered.",

A separate softwater breeding aquarium should be set up (peat filtration recommended as the water should ideally have a pH below 6) with plenty of fine-leaved plants, a substrate of marbles, subdued lighting, and gentle air-driven filtration. One or more pairs of well-conditioned adults should then be carefully acclimatised across. When ready to spawn, and whilst swimming alongside one another, the male will nudge the female's abdomen. The eggs will be laid/fertilised a few at a time, and these should fall into the mass of plants or down into the safety of the marbles. This will continue until up the female is spent of eggs, and the parents, being voracious egg-eaters, should be removed immediately. It should be noted that some aquarists find breeding is more successful with a single pair, rather than a group, as the smaller number of adult fish present will mean less chance of predation. The eggs should hatch after 24-36 hours (temperature dependent) with the miniscule fry using up their yolk sacs and becoming free-swimming around 5-6 days later. Feed on infusoria, rotifers, and powdered first foods to begin with, moving on to larger foods such as microworm and Artemia nauplii as they grow.",

Males are inclined to be rather competitive with one another and show the marbled pattern seen in other forms when at their most assertive. These fish have long been used as a larger accent fish amongst smaller shoaling species and the key to successful cohabitation is to keep them occupied.

In the confines of an aquarium this is not an option, so add multiple females to spread the male's attention. The sexes can be easily distinguished by the shape of their dorsal fin - small and rounded in females, long and pointed in males. As this fish comes in many colour forms such as Blue, Opaline, Three-spot, Gold and White (a very pale strain of gold) these can all be mixed if you so desire.

        "care": "The Oranda is a selectively bred strain of goldfish. Domesticated goldfish date back to China's Ming dynasty and Fancy goldfish have long been popular aquarium pets, although often as a first venture into keeping an aquarium. This is a mixed blessing, as there are far better choices for small aquaria than these big, messy fishes. Given appropriate housing and care, fancy goldfish can attain a large size and easily live for more than 15-20 years. The aquarium should be spacious and ideally around 1.2 metres long to allow room for 30cm adults to be comfortable. The length and width of the tank are much more important than the height in this respect.\nFancy goldfish grow quickly so it is best to provide them with the largest aquarium that you can from the outset to provide a much safe, stable environment for them. The larger the volume of water, the more stable it will be in terms of water chemistry and temperature. During the warmer months, these fish can be kept outside in raised water features suitably filtered and protected from predators. This can be a great way to provide extra room for your pets and they'll benefit from the semi-natural conditions. Like any goldfish, Orandas will benefit from a seasonal drop in temperature and this can be provided by either moving them indoors in late autumn, or positioning their aquarium in a room that experiences cool room temperatures during the winter. Fancy goldfish are notoriously messy fish; they are voracious eaters and continually stir up the substrate in their ongoing search for food. Such considerable amounts of waste can lead to water quality issues in smaller aquaria if not monitored very closely. Efficient filtration that can handle copius solids is essential, and weekly partial water changes are advised in order to keep nitrate to a minimum. The water should be well-oxygenated (of particular importance during warmer spells of weather) and this is easily achieved by the use of spray-bar returns from filters or the use of an air pumps. Various species of robust plants can be added to the aquarium, but these will likely require periodic replacement due to them being uprooted/eaten - something most goldfish keepers accept and allow their fish to take pleasure in. The substrate can consist of rounded fine gravel or sand, and decor can include smooth rocks and ornaments with no sharp edges. Orandas are sociable creatures and should be kept in groups, either with their own kind or with other varieties of fancy goldfish. It is best, however, to avoid keeping the standard 'single-tailed' common goldfish alongside the fancy varieties as the common goldfish is a faster swimmer and may outcompete the fancies at feeding time. Several colour varieties of Oranda are available, including black, blue, chocolate, red, red and white, red cap, white, yellow, and calico.",
        "feeding": "Due to their body shape, these fish need a high fibre diet and digestive problems are often the cause of buoyancy issues as transit times are compromised by convoluted digestive tracts. Goldfish also tend to swallow air in their rush to feed which also leads to problems which are best avoided by the use of sinking foods. These can be in the form of pellets, sticks or flake presented beneath the water surface. Frozen foods or live foods such as bloodworm, Mysis, and Daphnia will provide fibre and can be fed extensively to individuals displaying issues that are often categorised as Swim Bladder Disease. The opportunity to browse on aquatic plants will help to ensure gut health.",
        "breeding": "Well-conditioned fancy goldfish will often spawn in the home aquarium. Female fish will be noticeably rounder bellied when full of eggs, and the male fish will develop spawning tubercles (tiny raised bumps) on the gill plates and pectoral fins. A large, slightly cooler water change is often enough to trigger ready pairs into spawning. As the temperature slowly rises back up to its usual level, the male will pursue the female around the aquarium, but generally in a non-aggressive manner. This courtship ritual may last more than a day before spawning commences, and the colours of the fish often intensify at this time. The male fish will nudge the female into the fine-leaved plants (or spawning mops), where she will then scatter eggs which the male simultaneously fertilises. Spawning can last for a number of hours, and several thousand adhesive eggs may be scattered over the plants/spawning mop. The adults will be hungry and will start to devour as many eggs as they can find, so are best moved to another aquarium. The eggs take 4-5 days to hatch, depending on water temperature. Young fancy goldfish are often brown in colour (like their ancestors) and it can take up to a year before full colouration becomes apparent. Fancy goldfish often produce young that differ from their parents - high quality fish that show the best attributes of their breed are normally in the minority, hence the differences in price and quality between fish.",

The orange-blotched fish is a natural marbled colour variant that is not as numerous as the regular blue male/orange female standard form, but has proved to be a very popular aquarium subject. It belongs to the Mbuna group of cichlids. The aquarium should be at least 4ft long and aquascaped to emulate a rocky reef effect with some open expanses of sand. Decor such as ocean rock can be used to build sturdy structures which stretch from the base of the tank to near the surface of the water. These structures should be built with the purpose of creating many crevices for the fish to explore but constructed in such a way so as to keep the rocks stable if the fish start to dig around and underneath them. Although a substrate of coral sand or Aragonite is often recommended to help to keep the water hard and alkaline, Mbuna feel safer and show better colours over a darker substrate. The Aragonite or coral sand can always be placed into a mesh bag and kept inside the external filter for buffering purposes. Males mature with a salmon pink base colour, which is the closest to the blue form more common in the wild population. Females remain a warm orange red. It is best to keep one male with several females (keeping just one will result in continual harassment and possibly death) and these can be kept successfully alongside other outgoing Mbuna. Other Maylandia species are best avoided though, particularly those of similar appearance, as males will respond most aggressively towards look-a-likes. Many Maylandia species are also capable of cross-breeding, something which should be avoided to keep the species pure.",

Vegetable matter such as cucumber, blanched spinach and romaine lettuce can be fed on a regular basis.",
        "breeding": "When ready to spawn, the colouration of the male will intensify and his aggression level will heighten. He will choose and clean a spawning site, then display to the female fish until one accepts him. They will circle each other in a head to tail manner a number of times, until the female deposits her eggs. These are deposited just one or two at a time and after doing so, she immediately turns around and picks them up. At the same time, the male will rotate so that he is almost on his side, at the same time shaking and extending his anal fin, releasing his milt. The female sees the egg spots on the male's anal fin and attempts to pick up those \"eggs\" whilst she is picking up the real ones that she deposited, and at the same time taking in milt. This is the method of fertilisation, and this ritual may go on for some hours. The eggs may be incubated for up to 25 days until they hatch and the resultant fry held for a further few days afterwards. Neither males nor females develop the dark botches until at least 3 months old.",

Females of both forms can be distinguished by the white margins to the caudal fin. \nThese fish can be kept in either hard and alkaline freshwater or brackish water aquaria, providing they are acclimatised carefully.

This species is relatively peaceful (unless breeding) and is best kept in groups due to its gregarious nature. Smaller numbers may result in dominant individual/s picking on the weaker fish; larger groups sizes will ensure that no one fish is continually picked on, with any bickering being spread amongst the shoal. This will also result in an attractive, more natural-looking display. Orange Chromides can be kept safely alongside many species, and choice of tankmates will depend on whether the fish are being maintained in fresh or brackish water. In freshwater aquaria, good tankmates could include danionins, rainbowfish, and rasboras, whereas those in brackish water could be kept alongside some of the larger sized livebearers such as mollies. Tiny fish may be eaten so are best avoided, likewise do not house with large, boisterous species as the chromides will become nervous. Interestingly, in the wild, juvenile Orange Chromides have been observed cleaning their larger sympatric relative, the Banded Chromide (Etroplus suratensis), in a fashion similar to that of some of the marine wrasses.",
        "feeding": "Omnivorous. Flake, green flake, and slow-sinking pellets/granules can be given, but frozen foods such as Spirulina-enriched brineshrimp, bloodworm, white mosquito larvae, Mysis shrimp etc are preferred. It is important that these fish are provided with a good amount of vegetable matter such as blanched spinach, kale, Romaine lettuce, dried seaweeds etc.",
        "breeding": "Orange Chromides are bi-parental substrate spawners, and have been bred in the home aquarium in both fresh and brackish water. The parent fish will select a flat rock in a sheltered location and clean it. Up to 200 eggs will be deposited on the cleaned rock, and these will be guarded by both parents. The eggs should hatch within 2-5 days (temperature dependent), and the parents will move the wrigglers amongst several pre-dug pits until they absorb their yolk sacs and become free-swimming after a further 2-3 days. At this point they may feed on the parents' body mucus. The parents will care for their young for an extended period of time, until they are large enough to defend themselves and are almost reaching sexual maturity.",

Exports from this region are few and far between, so most specimens seen in the trade are captive bred and display more orange compared to their wild counterparts. This peaceful species is ideal for the mature subtropical community aquarium, and should be maintained in groups of 5 or more due to shoaling nature. Unfortunately, it can be a little prone to barbel infections/erosion, so it is of paramount importance that the fish are kept on a soft sand substrate (rather than gravel where waste can build up unseen) in order to protect these delicate sensory organs. Filtration should be efficient with areas of moderate water movement and a decent level of oxygenation. Regular maintenance, including frequent partial water changes, should be carried out in order to keep these fish in good condition. Provide plenty of shady areas amongst driftwood, rocks, and areas of dense planting. Tankmates should also be small and peaceful, and enjoy the same cooler conditions that these catfish require long-term. The presence of dither fish in midwater will help to encourage the Corydoras out into view more often. Corydoras have the ability to breathe air intestinally, so a small gap should be left between the surface of the water and the cover slides in order for the fish to come up to the surface and take air in. It may do this numerous times per day.\nOsteogaster was recently split from Corydoras and contains the Bronze cory group.",

The adhesive eggs will then be deposited onto plants, decor, or the sides of the aquarium etc and the process repeated. Unfortunately the eggs of this species are prone to fungus, so some fishkeepers like to add a small amount of methylene blue to the breeding tank. The eggs generally take 3-5 days to hatch after which time the tiny fry should be offered finely powdered first foods. A few days later they will be able to take newly hatched brineshrimp.",

They may not always show their best colours in shop stock tanks, but once settled into the home aquarium, their warm tones will intensify, especially when kept in blackwater set ups. Despite its rarity, this seems to be a hardy and easily-kept community fish suitable for most communities of peaceful fish. As with many deeper-bodied tetras, social behaviour usually features males defending their personal space against rivals and displaying to passing females. Due to it's strong links back to the wild, efforts to provide the soft, acidic conditions of the wild habitat will be appreciated and nitrates should be kept to a minimum.\n  Despite arriving in the trade as a Bolivian form of the Lemon tetra, it seems that this fish may be the tetra from the Tapajos that was mistaken for wild pulchripinnis back in 1980, with the true homeland of the Lemon being the Xingu region instead. Ichthyologists and those who've bred both species believe that it's distinct enough to warrant separate classification, and it's likely that it will gain a new binomial in future. As an orange lemon, creative common names such as St Clements tetra are waiting to be discovered and we've elected to drop the use of Bolivian in the name as this may well be misleading.

Firstly the tank should be biologically mature and must contain an abundance of bogwood, as this forms an essential part of the diet (these fish can actually be heard rasping their way around the aquarium!). There should be plenty of sheltered retreats created from the bogwood as well as from smooth rockwork, so that these nocturnal catfish feel comfortable during the day. They do not enjoy overly bright illumination, so ensure that there are many shady areas formed by driftwood, caves, and even floating plants, which will help to diffuse the light. Robust plants such as Anubias and Java Fern could be included (tied to the wood for best results) but avoid soft-leaved or delicate plants as these will be uprooted or eaten. Excellent water conditions should be maintained at all times via the use of a powerful filtration system that can cope with the amount of wood waste. A good current and high level of oxygenation will serve the fish well, and may even tempt them into breeding. Orange Spot Plecos are generally very peaceable, but males will squabble with one another over territory, so if planning on maintaining more than one specimen, ensure the tank is spacious and furnished with enough visual barriers and caves to keep everyone happy. These catfish are peaceful towards other types of fish and should only be kept alongside small quiet species e.g. small tetras, hatchet fish, pencilfish, rainbowfish, Corydoras catfish etc.\nThere are thought to be several colour/pattern forms of these fish, which vary according to collection location; it is unclear at this stage as to whether they are all P. albomaculatus, or whether some may represent different species. However, all specimens have a dark base colour, with the spots varying from off-white through to bright mustard, and as such these fish may also be seen on sale as Mustard Spot Pleco.",

Vegetable matter such as courgette, cucumber, potato, squash, sweet potato etc will also be enjoyed, and this can be supplemented with algae wafers and sinking catfish pellets. The odd treat of mosquito larvae should be ok, but avoid feeding protein-rich foods on a regular basis as this will cause digestive issues.",
        "breeding": "The Orange Spot Pleco has not been bred in the home aquarium. Panaqolus species tend to be a bit more challenging to breed compared to other plecos, and this would make for an interesting breeding project for dedicated hobbyists.

        "care": "The Ornate Bichir is known from the Congo River basin, the Lake Rukwa drainage, and the Lake Tanganyika basin. Although it is found in a variety of different water parameters, it prefers quieter, swampy areas with an abundance of aquatic vegetation. This solitary nocturnal predator tends to seek refuge in dimly lit, sheltered nooks and crannies during the day, emerging at night to feed on insect larvae, worms, and small fish. An aquarium that houses this species should be spacious - ideally at least 6ft x 2ft x 2ft for adult specimens - and very well covered, as these fish are great escape artists. Ensure that any gaps where wires feed in to the aquarium are plugged securely with filter foam or mesh glued into place. The lid of the aquarium may also need to be weighted down. Ornate Bichirs have the ability to breathe atmospheric air via their modified swim bladders (part of which functions as an accessory breathing organ to allow them to survive out of water for a time), so a small gap MUST be left between the surface of the water and the cover slides in order for the fish to come up to the surface and take air in. If the fish are denied regular access to air above the surface of the water, they may actually drown, so always run the tank with a dropped waterline. The substrate should consist of soft sand as these fish spend a lot of time foraging about on the bottom of the tank. Smooth water worn rocks and spindly driftwood can be used to create shady caves and there should be areas of dense planting with tall, hardy species such as Vallisneria and large Anubias or Aponogeton spp. Illumination should not be too bright, or if it is, it should be diffused via heavy planting. A blue moon light timed to come on just before the main lights switch off will allow you to view the night-time antics of these fascinating fish. The water should be filtered efficiently but with a gentle output, so that the fish do not have to contend with an overwhelming current. The Polypterus genus is closely related to the monotypic Erpetoichthys genus (Reed Fish), both of which are considered to be the last surviving relatives of some very ancient, primitive species. As their eyesight is quite poor, Ornate Bichirs rely on their excellent sense of smell in order to locate food items, and although carnivorous by nature, they are generally very peaceful, and can be kept successfully alongside other medium sized peaceable species. Avoid any tankmates which are small enough to fit into their mouths, as they will be predated upon overnight. Good companions could include some of the medium sized, relatively peaceful cichlid species such as Angelfish, Severums or Festivums, large Trichogaster gouramis, knife fish, other Polypterus spp., or Synodontis catfish. Avoid any really boisterous species though, as otherwise they may outcompete your Ornate Bichir at feeding times. Ornate Bichirs can be kept in groups in voluminous aquaria, but ensure that all specimens are of similar size and that there is a plethora of hiding places (allow several per fish) so they can form individual territories. Be aware that although Ornate Bichirs are considered quite hardy and will acclimatise to a wide range of conditions, they do not handle swings in pH well at all. Likewise, nitrates should not be allowed to creep up, so ensure that small partial water changes are carried out on a regular basis. This species is recommended for advanced aquarists only.",
        "feeding": "These carnivores rarely take dried foods in captivity, so you must be prepared to offer them various meaty frozen foods.

If she is ready to spawn, she will stop swimming and the male will wrap his anal fin around her genital opening. Both fish will remain motionless whilst a few eggs are deposited in a cup formed by the male\"\u2122s anal fin, and there they will be fertilised before being dispersed by powerful movements of his tail. The eggs are adhesive and will stick to the plants. This procedure is repeated many times until the female is spent of eggs (usually 200-300). The adults exhibit no parental care. The eggs should hatch after approximately 3-4 days, but remain attached to the vegetation whilst the fry absorb their yolk sacs. A few days later they will begin feeding and should be offered baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii).

Here they tend to inhabit the slower reaches and lurk amongst dense marginal vegetation. The aquarium should be mature with a dark substrate and an abundance of hiding places amongst tangles of driftwood and dense planting. In addition to rooted varieties, floating species can be useful to help diffuse the light and make these shy fish feel more secure. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement fairly gentle, and small, frequent partial water changes will help keep nitrate to a minimum. Ornate Climbing Perches will adapt to a range of water conditions provided that extremes are avoided, but will always show their best colours in soft, slightly acidic water. RO water may be needed in hardwater areas, and you may also like to filter the water through a medium of aquatic peat to help emulate the natural conditions. The addition of leaf litter would further help in this respect - dried Indian Almond leaves (Terminalia catappa) are ideal and are readily available. Although this is generally a timid and peaceful fish, males will show some territorial aggression towards one another, particularly when spawning. However, in spacious tanks with a plethora of visual barriers, this should not normally cause any real issues, and so small groups can usually be maintained together successfully in the same aquarium. If tankmates are desired, they should be small and peaceful and ideally occupy the upper levels of the water column. Good companions could include hatchetfish, killifish, rasboras, and tetras, and the presence of these fish may encourage the Ornate Climbing Perches out into the open a bit more. Avoid really tiny fish or fry, and do not house with any boisterous or nippy species. Young specimens in the shop may be overlooked as they are likely to be very pale, but these fish will show more colour as they settle in and mature.

If a female is receptive, the pair will embrace under the bubble-nest with the male wrapping its body around the female, with eggs and milt released simultaneously. The eggs should hatch within 24-36 hours and the fry will become free-swimming after a further 48-72 hours. The parents may predate on the young so it is best to remove them once the eggs hatch. The miniscule fry should be offered infusoria as a first food, followed by baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) as they grow.

Here, their territories tend to be centred around cracks or fissures in the rocks and rubble. The natural diet consists primarily of small crustaceans, insect larvae, and molluscs picked from the algae-encrusted substrate, and occasionally, drifting plankton. This species is mostly confined to the northern half of the lake, but there is one geographical variant found in the vicinity of Mpulungu in the south. The aquarium that houses this species should be at least 3ft long, with a good amount of filtration, water movement and oxygenation. The best choice of substrate would be coral sand or aragonite, which will help to keep the water hard and alkaline. Rocks should be used to create small outcrops and plenty of caves/crevices, ensuring that there are ample broken lines-of-sight. J. ornatus can be somewhat aggressive towards one another in the confines of the home aquarium, so in most situations, they are best kept singly or in compatible pairs. These cichlids can be maintained as part of a Tanganyikan community with fish of similar size and temperament, and which occupy different areas of the tank; however, do not mix them with other Julidochromis species. If the tank is particularly voluminous, multiple pairs can be kept as long as there are plenty of territories to go round (several per fish) and a multitude of visual barriers. Ornate Julies are intolerant of poor water conditions, so ensure small partial water changes are carried out on a frequent basis. May also be seen on sale as the Golden Julie.",

        "breeding": "Cave spawner. The bond these fish form when breeding is strong and is retained during brood care and subsequent spawns. In order to obtain a compatible pair, it is often best to purchase a group of juveniles and to allow a pair to form naturally, rehoming the remaining fish. The pair will choose a suitable cave as a spawning site, and when ready, the female will deposit her eggs (averaging 30-50) on the sides/roof of the cave, the male immediately swimming over them and fertilising with his sperm. It is not always obvious when these fish have spawned, as oftentimes they are very secretive and the cave may be hidden from view. Once spawning has finished, the female will tend to the eggs, with the male fish guarding the perimeter of the cave. The eggs should hatch within 2-3 days (temperature dependent), with the fry becoming free swimming a few days later. The young can be started off on a diet of freshly hatched brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and finely powdered \"\u02dcfirst foods\"\u2122. Brood care is fairly prolonged, and the immature offspring may then help in guarding the subsequent generation of fry, coexisting within the same aquarium and forming a nuclear family. The cycle continues as the adults spawn again, and it is possible to have several generations living together if the tank is large enough. However, if the aquarium is on the smaller side, and there becomes a shortage of territories, it may be best to rehome the eldest fry once they reach around 2.5cm/1\" in size, for their own safety.",

        "care": "The Oscar is a very large-growing South American cichlid that will eventually require a very large aquarium. Juveniles can be kept in smaller aquaria, but they are fast growers and will need moving to bigger quarters fairly quickly. They are NOT suitable for housing in a community situation, as smaller fish will be preyed upon. These cichlids will have individual personalities, but they do usually make good companions for *appropriately-sized* large catfish such as the Common Pleco (Pterygoplichthys pardalis), many of the larger-growing species of Synodontis or Pimelodids, large talking catfish and so on. Ideally, the tank will be spacious enough to house at least 5 or 6 specimens, as smaller groups can result in aggression-related problems, whilst a solitary specimen, on the other hand, will become lonely and withdrawn. The only exception to this rule is when re-homing a compatible adult pair, as they are unlikely to accept newcomers into their domain. The tank itself should have a large open swimming space and some robust d\u00c3\u00a9cor at the sides and back. Be sure that any rockwork is very secure, as these fish can be fairly destructive and like to move things about \"\u201c falling rockwork could have disastrous consequences. Plants will be uprooted and damaged, so they are not recommended. Heaters can be easily damaged, so ensure that they are fitted with a proper heater guard, or else use a filter with a built-in heater, or place the heater inside a sump. Ensure the tank is well-covered, as these cichlids are capable of jumping. Oscars not only grow to quite a length, but attain a large body mass too. As messy feeders they require an excellent external filtration system, coupled with frequent partial water changes to cope with the amount of waste produced. If excellent water quality and proper diet is not maintained, this species is susceptible to hole-in-the-head disease, and this really can be so easily avoided. Many Oscar keepers report how these intelligent fish quickly learn to recognise their owners, likening them to \"pet dogs\", such are their characters and responses to visual stimuli.\n  Several varieties exist including Albino, Red, Red Tiger and Long-fin.",

Larger specimens should be offered bigger frozen foods such as krill and cockle, plus chopped prawns, mussel, whitebait etc plus sinking cichlid pellets. There is absolutely NO need to offer Oscars live feeder fish and we do not encourage this practice in any way. Aside from the ethics, there is also the risk of introduced disease. Oscars are in no way picky feeders and will avidly consume pretty much all prepared aquarium foods with gusto.",

        "care": "The Pacific Blue-eye has a wide area of distribution along the east coast of Australia, from the Cape York Peninsula in northern Queensland, southwards to Ulladulla in New South Wales, along with populations on some of the offshore islands in the Torres Strait. It is found in a wide variety of habitats from clear forest streams and swamps to brackish mangrove estuaries. As might be expected from such a large geographical range, there are thought to be up to 15 variants of this species, showing marked differences in colour, pattern, and size depending on original collection location. These diminutive fish make wonderful additions to the small-medium planted aquarium housing other petite, peaceful species, or even showcased as a single species shoal in a high end aquascape. The tank should be mature and have areas of dense vegetation, including some floating species, along with several tangles of driftwood (the spindly Sumatra wood is ideal) to help diffuse the light. Dark background and substrate choices will help to bring out the colours of these active fish. Filtration should be efficient, and the water well-oxygenated, but the flow should not be too strong. Always maintain Pacific Blue-eyes in groups of 10 or more specimens, ideally with one or two females to every male. Not only will this make the fish less nervous, but it will also result in a more effective, natural-looking display. Male fish will put on quite a show as they compete with one another for female attention, but no real damage should ensue during such sparring sessions. Tankmates should be small and peaceable and enjoy the same water conditions, e.g. some of the smaller goby or catfish species, other small rainbowfish, and many diminutive cyprinids; small bottom-dwelling gobies or catfish working particularly well as Blue-eyes tend to occupy the middle to upper levels of the aquarium. Avoid keeping alongside slow-moving fish that have long trailing fins, such as gouramis, as they may be nipped at. Much care must be taken when acclimatising this species to the home aquarium, as they can be very sensitive to changes in water chemistry and temperature. Similar care should be taken when carrying out frequent partial water changes.",

These fish are known as 'continuous spawners' which means that the eggs are deposited over a period of some days/weeks. The eggs, which are relatively large, should be removed to another tank (with matching water conditions) after each spawning, as otherwise the hungry parents will consume them. Each batch of eggs becomes progressively smaller. The eggs usually hatch within 14-21 days, the timescale being very dependent on water temperature. The fry should be offered infusoria and powdered fry foods, moving on to baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) as they grow. Frequent partial water changes should be carried out with the utmost of care, as the fry are extremely sensitive to changes in their environment.",

Like all of its kin, this fish is best kept on a soft sand substrate where it can root around and forage without risk to its barbels which can be damaged by abrasion and bacterial infections from the accumulated waste that often builds up in coarse gravel. Filtration should be efficient with areas of moderate water movement and a decent level of oxygenation. Regular maintenance, including frequent partial water changes, should be carried out in order to keep these fish in good condition. Provide plenty of shady areas amongst driftwood, rocks, and areas of dense planting. As a social species, they should be kept in groups of 5 or more. Other peaceful species such as some of the smaller pencilfish, tetra, and rasboras make ideal tankmates, and their presence as \"dither fish\" in midwater will encourage the Corydoras out into view more often. These fish have the ability to breathe air intestinally, so a small gap should be left between the surface of the water and the cover slides in order for the fish to come up to the surface and take air in.

The male fish will usually guard the general harem territory but do keep a close eye on him as sometimes the female can act extremely aggressively towards him after spawning, and he may need to be transferred temporarily to another tank. The eggs should hatch after 2 or 3 days, depending on water temperature. The female continues guarding the wrigglers, and after a further 5 days, will lead the fry out of the cave. She will be very pugnacious at this point, fending off any would-be predators. The fry will require frequent small feeds with appropriately sized foodstuffs at this point, such as baby brineshrimp. If the spawning has occurred in a general community tank, it is a good idea to feed the other fish their food at the opposite end of the aquarium at the same time, to avoid undue stress to the female, who will be desperately trying to guard her young.

Unlike many members of the Garra genus, this species is relatively sociable, and is best kept in groups of 5 or more. In numbers less than this, they may squabble amongst themselves (and similar species) every so often, \"greying out\" as they do so. The aquarium should be aquascaped with a soft sand or very fine rounded gravel substrate, and furnished with cobbles, smooth rocks, and bogwood pieces. Lighting can be fairly bright to encourage algae growth, which the fish will enjoy browsing on for the micro-organisms it may contain. Shady areas can be provided with the layout of the rockwork/bogwood, and by growing canopies of hardy plants such as Anubias sp. or Java fern (both tied to the driftwood). Some thought should be given to creating a number of \"visual barriers\" within the aquarium at the time of aquascaping, so if any minor territorial disputes do arise, the fish can get away from the other's line of sight. An extremely important point to note is that Garra flavatra are capable of climbing up the glass with ease, something they tend to do when newly imported or moved; therefore be absolutely sure the tank has tight fitting cover slides and that there are no small gaps that the fish can crawl out of e.g. where equipment power leads feed into the back of the hood. Bottom dwelling tankmates could include many of the peaceful botiid river loaches, the nemacheilid brook loaches, and the more robust members of the balitorid hillstream loach group. For the upper levels, consider some of the Barilius, Danio, Devario, Opsarius, and smaller members of the Puntius genera (research individual species to ensure compatibility before purchase though, as not every species from these genera will be suitable). Although these fish tend to be of a peaceful nature, they can be fairly boisterous at feeding times and are not recommended for housing alongside slow-moving laterally-compressed fish such as discus or angelfish (which do not benefit from the same water conditions anyway). Water quality is of utmost importance for the Panda Garra \"\u201c be sure to carry out regular partial water changes to ensure that nitrate levels remain at a minimum.

The water here is cool, fast-flowing, and well-oxygenated, and it flows over substrates of sand, smooth gravel, water worn rocks, and boulders. There is little in the way of aquatic vegetation, but riparian plants do line the margins and a rich biofilm layer coats the rocks. A requisite for the care of these fish in the home aquarium is a mature river-style tank with cool, highly oxygenated water and plenty of current. Tight fitting coverslides are a must and lighting may be fairly bright to encourage some natural algae growth and to help simulate the shallow stream conditions they experience in the wild. However, you may need a means of chilling the water to a subtropical temperature during unusually hot summer months. Provide a sandy substrate along with plenty of nooks and crannies formed from pebbles, rocks, and pieces of slate. It is best not to add bogwood as this will affect water chemistry, rendering it too soft and acidic for these loaches. As mentioned above, plants are not found in any great abundance in the fast-flowing waters of the natural habitat of the Panda Loach, so are not considered essential; however robust, broad-leaved plants will add to the aquascape and create further resting places for the Panda Loaches, which will enjoy gently browsing about on the leaves and seemingly \"\u02dcsurfing\"\u2122 in the current. Juvenile Panda Loaches are very eye-catching, sporting bold black blotches on a creamy-white body. This pattern changes drastically as the fish mature, breaking up and taking on a much less striking, but still attractive mottled brown/cream appearance. A dark band often forms along the lateral line. These fish are highly sociable and should be kept in good sized groups; 5 would really be considered the absolute minimum. The larger the group, the better the chances are of obtaining both sexes - which may lead to spawning opportunities. They can be kept alongside other sub-tropical current-loving species such as White Cloud Mountain Minnows and many species from the Danio family, plus other hillstream loach species. Other fish normally found alongside Y. pachychilus in nature include Erromyzon (formerly Protomyzon) sinensis and Vanmanenia pingchowensis. Like other species that inhabit fresh running waters, these loaches will not tolerate a build-up of nitrates within the aquarium and require excellent water conditions at all times if they are to thrive - so powerful filtration and regular partial water changes are essential. Y. pachychilus is listed as of \"\u02dcleast concern\"\u2122 on the IUCN red list of endangered species, but \"\u02dcrare\"\u2122 in the China Red Book of Endangered Animals and \"\u02dcvulnerable\"\u2122 on the China species red list.

Given appropriate housing and care, fancy goldfish can attain a large size and easily live for more than 15-20 years. The aquarium should be spacious and ideally around 1.2 metres long to allow room for 30cm adults to be comfortable. The length and width of the tank are much more important than the height in this respect.\nFancy goldfish grow quickly so it is best to provide them with the largest aquarium that you can from the outset to provide a much safe, stable environment for them. The larger the volume of water, the more stable it will be in terms of water chemistry and temperature. During the warmer months, these fish can be kept outside in raised water features suitably filtered and protected from predators. This can be a great way to provide extra room for your pets and they'll benefit from the semi-natural conditions. Like any goldfish, Orandas will benefit from a seasonal drop in temperature and this can be provided by either moving them indoors in late autumn, or positioning their aquarium in a room that experiences cool room temperatures during the winter. Fancy goldfish are notoriously messy fish; they are voracious eaters and continually stir up the substrate in their ongoing search for food. Such considerable amounts of waste can lead to water quality issues in smaller aquaria if not monitored very closely. Efficient filtration that can handle copius solids is essential, and weekly partial water changes are advised in order to keep nitrate to a minimum. The water should be well-oxygenated (of particular importance during warmer spells of weather) and this is easily achieved by the use of spray-bar returns from filters or the use of an air pumps. Various species of robust plants can be added to the aquarium, but these will likely require periodic replacement due to them being uprooted/eaten - something most goldfish keepers accept and allow their fish to take pleasure in. The substrate can consist of rounded fine gravel or sand, and decor can include smooth rocks and ornaments with no sharp edges. Orandas are sociable creatures and should be kept in groups, either with their own kind or with other varieties of fancy goldfish. It is best, however, to avoid keeping the standard 'single-tailed' common goldfish alongside the fancy varieties as the common goldfish is a faster swimmer and may outcompete the fancies at feeding time. This strain can be variable in the proportions of black to white colouration and this can develop and change as individuals grow.",
        "feeding": "Due to their body shape, these fish need a high fibre diet and digestive problems are often the cause of buoyancy issues as transit times are compromised by convoluted digestive tracts. Goldfish also tend to swallow air in their rush to feed which also leads to problems which are best avoided by the use of sinking foods. These can be in the form of pellets, sticks or flake presented beneath the water surface. Frozen foods or live foods such as bloodworm, Mysis, and Daphnia will provide fibre and can be fed extensively to individuals displaying issues that are often categorised as Swim Bladder Disease. The opportunity to browse on aquatic plants will help to ensure gut health.",
        "breeding": "Well-conditioned fancy goldfish will often spawn in the home aquarium. Female fish will be noticeably rounder bellied when full of eggs, and the male fish will develop spawning tubercles (tiny raised bumps) on the gill plates and pectoral fins. A large, slightly cooler water change is often enough to trigger ready pairs into spawning. As the temperature slowly rises back up to its usual level, the male will pursue the female around the aquarium, but generally in a non-aggressive manner. This courtship ritual may last more than a day before spawning commences, and the colours of the fish often intensify at this time. The male fish will nudge the female into the fine-leaved plants (or spawning mops), where she will then scatter eggs which the male simultaneously fertilises. Spawning can last for a number of hours, and several thousand adhesive eggs may be scattered over the plants/spawning mop. The adults will be hungry and will start to devour as many eggs as they can find, so are best moved to another aquarium. The eggs take 4-5 days to hatch, depending on water temperature. Young fancy goldfish are often brown in colour (like their ancestors) and it can take up to a year before full colouration becomes apparent. Fancy goldfish often produce young that differ from their parents - high quality fish that show the best attributes of their breed are normally in the minority, hence the differences in price and quality between fish.",

The home aquarium should contain soft, acidic water and be biologically mature before these fishes are added. Ideally there will be dark substrate and dense planting, with plenty of hiding places/territories amongst rocks, driftwood, coconut shells etc. Floating plant cover could be used to help diffuse the light. Peat filtration and the addition of dried Indian Almond Leaves (Terminalia catappa) would be beneficial to help create the favoured conditions, and be aware that the tank should have a tight fitting cover, as these fish can jump. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement gentle, and frequent partial water changes should be carried out in order to keep nitrate at a minimum. A. panduro are generally peaceful, but can become rather territorial when breeding. Keep either a single pair, or in larger aquaria, one male with several females (which will form a harem). The females will seek out individual territories, hence the importance of many visual barriers within the tank. Good tankmates include Corydoras catfish, hatchetfish, pencilfish, small tetras, and suckermouth catfish. Like many of the Apistogramma species, A. panduro will not tolerate an elevated nitrate level. Regular partial water changes are an absolute must for their continued wellbeing.

The water should be very soft and acidic, and the temperature raised to the top end of their preferred range. Ideally, each female fish will be provided with a suitable spawning site in the form of a cave or flower pot on its side. Eggs will be laid on the ceiling of the cave or pot, and these will be guarded by the female. The male fish will guard the general harem territory. The eggs should hatch after 2 to 4 days, depending on water temperature. The female continues guarding the wrigglers, and after a further few days, will lead the fry out of the cave. She will be very pugnacious at this point, fending off any would-be predators. The fry will require frequent small feeds with appropriately sized foodstuffs at this point, such as baby brineshrimp. If the spawning has occurred in a general community tank, it is a good idea to feed the other fish their food at the opposite end of the aquarium at the same time, to avoid undue stress to the female, who will be desperately trying to guard her young. Sometimes the female will take the fry up in her mouth and move them to another area of the tank.",

Much larger quarters will be necessary if you wish to keep them alongside other fish. There should be a soft sandy substrate and numerous hiding places/visual barriers created amongst the decor from large pieces of driftwood and rocks/slate. Such structures should be made secure as adult Pantano Cichlids are more than capable of moving the d\u00c3\u00a9cor around; bonding pieces of rock together with aquarium grade silicon sealant prior to filling the tank is sensible. All aquatic plants will be seen as food, so are best omitted from the aquascape, or else consider using plastic/silk varieties. Filtration should be very efficient (these fish are messy eaters) but water movement fairly gentle. This species is especially sensitive to the build-up of pollutants, so small frequent water changes are a must to help keep nitrogenous waste to a minimum. The Pantano Cichlid is relatively peaceful - as far as large Central American cichlids go - although it is still rather territorial, especially when breeding.

Aquatic plants are likely to be eaten, although species such as Anubias or Java fern may survive. Note that these crabs require warmer than average temperatures to thrive. Although an aquatic species, it may be wise to provide opportunities to leave the water occasionally for long-term health. A tight fitting lid is essential and be sure to block all holes where equipment feeds into the tank, as these crabs are great escape artists. Regular partial water changes should be carried out and it may be necessary to buffer KH to ensure the pH remains above 8 or thereabouts. Supplementary sources of calcium such as cuttlefish bone or even plaster vacation feeding blocks would be welcomed and this species seems to enjoy hunting snails. As they're capable of catching slow-moving fish, care should be taken if combining them with tankmates, although some aquarists have success keeping them alongside small, fast-swimming species that live in open water. As with any crustaceans, fish medications are likely to prove harmful and care must be taken if contending with disease in any aquarium housing crabs or shrimps.

Plants are not strictly necessary, although they may make the tank look more aesthetically pleasing; however try to choose robust species, preferably those that can be tied to wood and not uprooted by digging. A powerful filtration system is recommended as these fish, like other Loricariids, do tend to produce a fair amount of waste. Tankmates for the mid level of the tank, which will help encourage your plecs out into the open, could include good sized shoals of some of the small to medium sized tetras, plus they also get along very well with Brochis and Corydoras catfish who would share the substrate/lower levels.

        "breeding": "This species has been bred in the home aquarium, but it is fairly challenging from the point of view that it can be difficult to obtain a compatible pair, especially when it is quite difficult to tell males and females apart. Para Plecs are said to be sexually mature at around 13cm in length. The best way forward is to acquire a group of several youngsters of the same size/age (hoping this will contain both sexes) and grow them on, observing for any signs of pairing. You should be able to see subtle differences in mature fish, such as those detailed above (see Sexual Dimorphism) plus also when female fish fill with eggs, their genital papillae will swell and become noticeably bigger/rounder compared to that of the males which is smaller and pointed. Male fish often become more dominant at feeding times too. Once you are confident that you can identify a pair, they should be carefully acclimatised across to a breeding aquarium that has been set up with matching water parameters. If left in the main tank, the male may become too preoccupied with other males over territories and suitable spawning partners, and breeding is very unlikely to take place. It is important that the breeding aquarium also has good water movement and a high level of oxygenation, and make certain that the breeding cave is placed in an area of moderate flow. The water temperature should be maintained at the higher end of the preferred range. Compared to many other Loricariids, Para Plecs are actually rather tender with one another when spawning. When ready to spawn, the male will gently coax the female into the cave, then he joins her side by side. As soon as they have spawned, the male exits the cave, allowing the female to leave, then moves back in to take up paternal care of the eggs. The eggs should hatch within 6-7 days (temperature dependent), and the resultant wrigglers will use up their extra-large yolk sac over the next 7-8 days, after which time they will become free-swimming and require feeding with suitable sinking foods such as pleco tablets and tiny frozen fare. The fry can be safely left in the tank alongside the adults, but many breeders prefer to move the adults back to the main aquarium, making it easier to feed and monitor the young on their own. It is essential that excellent water quality is maintained at all times, performing small-sized water changes little and often.",

        "care": "Paradise Fish are known from a huge array of heavily-vegetated lowland habitats, including small slow-flowing streams and irrigation channels, to paddy fields, marshes, and the sluggish backwaters of large rivers. These labyrinth fish are even known to colonise fairly stagnant standing waters with low oxygen content, due to their specialised atmospheric air-breathing ability. The home aquarium should be spacious and furnished with plenty of driftwood and tall plants which will grow to create a good amount of surface cover. Floating plants can also be included to help diffuse bright lighting, and a dark substrate and background will help these fish to feel secure and show their best colours. Try to create a maze-like habitat with plenty of visual barriers to break up lines of sight, as these fish can be rather territorial. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement gentle, to emulate the calm conditions these fish prefer. Although Paradise Fish are very adaptable and live in regions with seasonal fluctuations in temperature, they show their best colours when at their breeding temperatures above 22-24 \u00b0C . Constant tropical temperatures will age this fish prematurely.\nIt is important to leave a small gap of warm air between the water's surface and any coverslides in order for these labyrinth fish to come up and gulp air from time to time. A good cover will also prevent your Paradise Fish from jumping clear of the aquarium should they become startled. A species-only aquarium is the most suitable environment for these fish, due to their somewhat territorial and micro-predatorial nature. However, if tankmates absolutely must be kept, choose them very carefully, as small fish will be eaten, and nippy fish will damage the trailing fins of the Paradise Fish. Avoid keeping with any similar-looking fish, such as dwarf gouramis and Bettas. Whilst juvenile Paradise Fish are often seen swimming happily together in groups in dealer's aquaria, they will soon mature into territorial fish that show pronounced intraspecific aggression, particularly the males as they reach sexual maturity. Females tend to be much less aggressive and a single-male, multiple female group can be maintained together quite successfully in a suitably furnished tank.  \nInterestingly, the Paradise Fish was one of the first ornamental fish to be introduced to the European fishkeeping hobby back in 1869, or possibly in 1665 when Samuel Pepys wrote of seeing 'finely-marked fishes in a glass bowl' and this species is certainly more ornate than the goldfish which some claim that he was referring to. A number of selectively bred colour forms are available, including albino, xanthic, and line-bred forms with enhanced blue or red colouring. Blue and brown forms may reflect regional variation within the range of this species. Also known as the Chinese Fighting Fish in some parts of south-east Asia.",
        "feeding": "Offer a variety of dried foods, plus regular feedings with frozen fare such as Mysis shrimp, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, bloodworm, and white mosquito larvae etc. Warning: capable of taking small fish - choose tankmates with care.",
        "breeding": "Paradise Fish are fairly easy to breed in the home aquarium. Like many anabantoids, this is a bubble-nesting species, and the spawning process is very interesting to observe. A separate aquarium should be set-up for the spawning attempt; ideally this will be shallow and have tight fitting covers with no gaps. The tank should be filled mostly with water from the main aquarium (adding a small top up of fresh water), and a gentle air-driven sponge filter installed. Do not fill the aquarium right up - be sure to leave a decent gap at the top for a warm, humid layer of air to form above the water once the covers are shut (you can seal the tank top with cling film if the coverslides don't provide an airtight seal) as this will help the young to develop their labyrinth organ. Add some clumps of plants such as Ceratophyllum and Java Moss, set the temperature to around 26 \u00b0C, and then acclimatise a well-conditioned pair across. The male should soon start to build his bubble nest - he does this by swimming to the surface, drawing a little air into his mouth and enveloping it in a film of saliva, forming bubbles that then stick together in a raft formation at the water's surface, usually underneath a bit of surface vegetation. During the nest construction stage, the female is vulnerable to attack from the male if he sees her in the close vicinity, which is why the addition of plants is important not only to anchor the nest to, but to help provide cover for the female. Once the nest is complete, the behaviour of the male will markedly change, as he entices the female underneath his nest, embracing her in the typical anabantoid spawning position, whereby the male wraps himself around the female as sperm and eggs are released simultaneously. As the pair drift apart, the male gathers up any eggs that have not floated upwards to the safety of the nest, by taking them into his mouth and placing them in the nest one by one. He will repeat this until all eggs - which may number as many as 500 - have been safely gathered, and then proceeds to guard the nest until the eggs hatch. At this point, the female must be carefully removed and acclimatised back to the main aquarium for her own safety. The eggs should hatch within 48-96 hours (temperature dependent) and as the miniscule fry emerge, the nest will break apart. The behaviour of the male fish can be a bit unpredictable, but most are usually ok to stay with the fry for the first day or two - just observe carefully at this point. Some aquarists, however, prefer to remove the male as soon as the fry hatch, to prevent him from predating on them. Once free-swimming, the tiny fry require infusoria for the first week or so, moving on to baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and microworm as they grow. It is not uncommon for the young to develop at vastly different rates, and so it is essential that extra rearing tanks are set up in order that you may separate the smaller and larger fry, to prevent bullying and/or cannibalism.",

Here it is most commonly encountered in calm pools and backwaters, away from the main river channels. The aquarium should be biologically mature and spacious, with a large expanse of soft sand substrate as these fish like to sift through the substrate in their ongoing search for food items. Provide plenty of hiding places amongst tangles of driftwood, rocky caves, and robust planting cultivated on the wood (such as Anubias sp. or Java Fern). Vegetation planted into the substrate is likely to be dug up, so is best avoided. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement fairly gentle. Frequent partial water changes will help keep nitrate to a minimum, particularly important as this species is sensitive to deteriorating water conditions. This fish, like other Gymnogeophagus species from colder climes, prefers the water to be a little cooler than most other South American cichlids (ideally 21-25 \u00b0C). Additionally, it is thought that a 3 month artificial winter is necessary for the longevity of Gymnogeophagus. To this end, the water temperature should be lowered to 16-18 \u00b0C for 3 consecutive months each year, so an aquarium chiller may be required to achieve this. Paraguay Eartheaters are best described as semi-aggressive and should be maintained singly, as a compatible pair, or one male with a harem of several females. Male fish will show much territorial hostility towards other males, particularly when ready to spawn. Tankmates should be chosen with care, avoiding small fish. Ideal companions should be of similar size and temperament, occupy the upper levels of the water column, and able to thrive under the same sub-tropical water temperature. May also be seen on sale as the Argentine Humphead.",

The male immediately follows behind her and fertilises them, and this is repeated until the female is spent of eggs. The male is then driven away from the spawning site, and the female stays with the eggs, fanning them with her pectoral fins. If there are other females in the tank, the male may also spawn with them. The eggs will begin to hatch some 3-4 days later (the female will actually assist with this) and the wrigglers are taken up into her mouth where they are incubated for a further 14 days or so until they are free-swimming. At this point they can be offered Artemia nauplii and powdered flake food. If the female senses danger, the fry are urged back into her mouth as quickly as possible.

The aquarium should be at least 4ft long and aquascaped to emulate a rocky reef effect with plenty of caves/visual barriers and a sandy substrate. D\u00c3\u00a9cor such as ocean rock can be used to build sturdy structures which stretch from the base of the tank to near the surface of the water. These structures should be built with the purpose of creating many crevices for the fish to explore but constructed in such a way so as to keep the rocks stable if the fish start to dig around and underneath them. Although a substrate of coral sand or Aragonite is often recommended to help to keep the water hard and alkaline, Mbuna feel safer and show better colours over a darker substrate. The Aragonite or coral sand can always be placed into a mesh bag and kept inside the external filter for buffering purposes. Most rock-dwelling species are extremely aggressive and need to be kept under conditions of 'controlled-overcrowding' to prevent territorial disputes ending fatally - additional filtration may also be required to cope with a heavy bioload. The Parallelus cichlid is a particularly belligerent example, and it is best to keep just one male in a harem situation with several females (keeping just one female with a male will result in continual harassment and death). This species can be kept successfully alongside other outgoing Mbuna that can hold their own, although it is best to avoid fish with a similar colour pattern. This colour pattern is reminiscent of some marine cleaner fishes and females have been observed cleaning large Haplochromine species in the wild. We recommend that Parallelus cichlids are amongst the last addition to an aquarium, as they can be extremely territorial when introducing new tankmates into what they perceive as their established domain.

        "breeding": "This maternal mouthbrooder has been bred in the home aquarium, but it is difficult and somewhat risky due to the highly aggressive nature of this species. It should be spawned in a species-only aquarium and in a harem situation with one male and at least 5 females in order to help dissipate aggression. Ensure there are plenty of visual barriers within the aquarium, as the male has been known to kill female fish that are not receptive to his advances. When ready to spawn, the colouration of the male will intensify and his aggression level will heighten further. He will choose and clean a spawning site, then display to the female fish until one accepts him. They will circle each other in a head to tail manner a number of times, until the female deposits her eggs. These are deposited just one or two at a time and after doing so, she immediately turns around and picks them up. At the same time, the male will rotate so that he is almost on his side, at the same time shaking and extending his anal fin, releasing his milt. The female sees the egg spots on the male\"\u2122s anal fin and attempts to pick up those \"\u0153eggs\"\u009d whilst she is picking up the real ones that she deposited, and at the same time taking in milt. This is the method of fertilisation, and this ritual may go on for some hours.

These stunning fish, with their scattering of intense natural red-orange colouration, should be maintained in groups of 6 or more due to their shoaling nature. As an active and fairly large-growing species, much swimming space is required, so it is important to house them in aquaria measuring 4ft long or larger. As with many other Rainbowfish species, the juveniles can look quite drab compared to the beautiful mature fish, and so are all too often overlooked in the shops. However, once settled into the security of the planted aquarium, these young specimens will soon begin to colour up, revealing their true adult beauty. Darker substrate and decor choices, together with areas of dense planting (along the sides and back of the aquarium) will help to intensify the colours of these fish even further. Parkinson's Rainbowfish will not bother smaller tankmates, as their mouth/throat is too narrow to be able to swallow them. Males may spar with other males when competing for the females, although no serious damage will occur. Whilst they will acclimatise to a wide range of conditions, they will be seen at their best in slightly harder, alkaline water. Of much more importance is their need for well-filtered clean water along with high levels of oxygenation, such is their preference for relatively high temperatures. A naturally occurring yellow morph of this species is known, however, it is rarely exported.",

        "breeding": "A separate good-sized breeding aquarium should be set up with 75% mature tank water and 25% of dechlorinated fresh water, along with a substrate of marbles. A small air-driven sponge filter (with a mature sponge) should be added to give gentle circulation and filtration. The temperature should be set at 28 \u00b0C. A conditioned pair should then be acclimatised across to the breeding aquarium, which should be furnished with plenty of fine-leaved plants/Java moss clumps. After a time, the male will swim in front of the female, displaying the mating stripe on his forehead. He will then begin to drive the female over the plants, utilising the whole length of the tank. The eggs will be scattered over the plants a few at a time. These fish are known as 'continual spawners' which means that the spawning activity takes place over several days/weeks, even months in some cases. This can present problems to the aquarist in that some adult fish may begin to consume the eggs as they are scattered. Many fishkeepers have found the eggs to be remarkably tough and have had great success in siphoning them out into another aquarium (containing matching water from the spawning tank) or else using spawning mops, which, when having caught a number of the eggs, can be moved to a separate tank (again with matching water) and replaced with a new mop, as and when each series of eggs are deposited. The eggs will usually hatch in 8-10 days (dependent on temperature) and once free-swimming, the tiny fry can be offered infusoria, moving onto larger foodstuffs as they develop.",

These large but delicate fish are not suitable for beginners and require a specialised set of conditions if they are to thrive. The aquarium should be very spacious with warm, soft, acidic water. There should be powerful filtration and the water should be well oxygenated via the use of spraybars and powerheads - this is particularly important at higher temperatures. In the wild, these fish prefer the safety of dimly lit areas amongst vegetation and fallen trees, so this should be replicated as best as possible; aquascaping the aquarium with plenty of bogwood and robust plants such as Microsorum pteropus, Anubias spp. or plastic/silk varieties in order to shade out bright lighting. Avoid delicate plants, as these will be uprooted/eaten.

Heaters can be easily damaged, so ensure that they are fitted with a proper heater guard, or else use a filter with a built-in heater, or place the heater inside a sump. Juvenile Parrot Cichlids can usually be kept together as a group if introduced simultaneously, any minor squabbles being spread throughout the group so that no one fish bears the brunt of it all. However, adults can be rather more cantankerous and somewhat territorial. If a pair forms naturally, and then chooses to spawn, they will become very aggressive towards other fish and as such any tankmates may need to be moved to another aquarium, unless the tank is of XXL proportions with an abundance of visual barriers (and even then, egg-crate may be necessary to separate them). If tankmates are desired, some of the warm water suckermouth catfish (Loricariidae) may be considered; however, do not keep with small fish, as the Parrot Cichlids will consider them food. Partial water changes must be carried out on a very frequent basis, as these fish are extremely sensitive to the build-up of nitrogenous wastes.

A compatible pair will engage in various pre-spawning behaviours, including displaying to one another and mouth wrestling. This can be a rather aggressive affair and torn fins/loss of scales are common (be prepared to separate the fish should things turn too violent). Spawning tends to occur on a solid surface - such as pre-cleaned slate - in a sheltered spot, although some reports indicate spawning pits were used. Several hundred eggs will be deposited.

It is a species that is listed as \"Critically Endangered\" on the IUCN redlist for endangered species, a status which stems from a combination of overfishing for the aquarium trade, loss of natural shade from the habitat, and pollution from agricultural effluents. The trade has apparently agreed to restrict exports to very small quantities in hope of safeguarding the wild population, and captive breeding programmes are underway. Within this small natural range, Devario pathirana is actually quite prolific; but because of the restricted area, and the obvious disastrous consequences if it were to be damaged/overfished, conservation measures are essential. Any hobbyist lucky enough to find these fish in the shops should seriously consider purchasing a good sized group, and set up their own active breeding programme for them. The aquarium itself should be spacious and well covered - this is a species capable of surprisingly high jumps. The water should be maintained at a steady subtropical temperature with a powerful flow rate and high levels of oxygenation. In order to create that river bed effect, piles of water-worn rocks and cobbles can be piled onto a substrate of fine rounded gravel, with bogwood roots stood upright at the back of the tank. Plants that are robust in nature and that can cope with the high flow environment can be used as part of the aquascape, but be sure to leave a large open swimming space in the centre of the tank for these active swimmers. Tankmates should be chosen with care, as these fish are fairly boisterous (particularly at feeding time) and will nip the fins of slower moving fancy finned fish. Best kept in groups of 6 or more of their own kind, with larger groups helping to ensure a good ratio of both sexes for breeding attempts.",

This species is a giant amongst cichlids, and is really only suitable for the most substantial home aquarium installations and public aquaria. If it is to be housed in the home aquarium, this must be of vast proportions with powerful, oversized filtration to match. Substrate should consist of soft sand, as these fish are messy eaters, and it will be easier to keep clean than gravels; otherwise they do equally as well with a bare-bottomed arrangement, which is also simple to maintain. These fish require plenty of swimming space, but some decor in the form of large pieces of bogwood and robust Anubias sp. or Java Fern motherplants cultivated on the wood will be appreciated. Rockwork can be used, but be sure it is stable, as these fish are more than capable of rearranging things - it may be wise to bond rocks together into a secure formation using aquarium silicon. Peacock Bass are voracious eaters that produce a lot of waste, and require continuous excellent water conditions. To this end, filtration must be powerful and the water well-oxygenated. A frequent partial water change regime is absolutely essential as this riverine fish will not tolerate an elevated nitrate level. Several huge canister filters can be employed, but sump filtration may be more prudent as then equipment such as heaters can be kept in the sump and out of the main tank where they would be very easily damaged. The Peacock Bass is a voracious predator and will eat anything that fits in its mouth, so tankmates must be chosen very carefully. It is territorially aggressive, so is best maintained singly or as a known mated pair. Do not attempt to house more than one male in the same tank, even if it is spacious. If tankmates are desired, it is possible to house them with other large Central/South American cichlids, large armoured catfish, arowana, or stingrays. To sum up: these fish are a huge commitment in terms of housing, equipment, maintenance, and longevity. Much consideration needs to be given prior to purchase to ensure its needs can be met.",

Juveniles are found in brackish waters, but as they mature into adults, they move into the more saline waters of the ocean. Unfortunately, for years this species has been erroneously marketed in the trade as a freshwater species, but brackish conditions are absolutely essential for juvenile fish, and the salinity should be very gradually increased to full marine conditions as it matures. Always use marine salt that is intended for use in saltwater aquaria, and test regularly with a hydrometer. This is a highly aggressive species that will not tolerate conspecifics in the same aquarium, so is best maintained as a solitary specimen. Some aquarists have had success housing them alongside moderately aggressive, fast-swimming temperate species in larger quarters, but this is a risk; careful observation and a means of separating the fish may be necessary. The aquarium itself should be spacious and furnished with plenty of rockwork to create a number of hiding places, whilst still maintaining ample space for this energetic fish with its somewhat erratic swimming behaviour. There should be a sand substrate as this puffer sometimes likes to wallow, particularly after a large meal. Aragonite or crushed coral will help to maintain a stable alkaline pH. Filtration should be efficient with areas of moderate water movement and some calmer resting spots out of the current. Regular partial water changes are a must to help keep nitrate to a minimum, as these fish are particularly sensitive to the build up of pollutants. As with other puffer species, these fish can inflate when frightened or cornered. They should never be provoked into doing so, and never above water where they can take on air, which can prove fatal. If moving a Peacock Fugu Puffer to different quarters, the fish should be herded into a solid container under the water so as to remove the necessity of netting and lifting them clear of the water. It is also worth noting that this species is not considered reef safe (it will eat anemones, corals, and motile invertebrates). A means of chilling the water may be necessary during the warmer summer months, and during spells of particularly hot weather, it is essential to increase the dissolved oxygen level of the water or this fish will struggle.

A soft sand substrate would serve these fish well, as they spend quite a proportion of their time on the bottom. The water should be soft and acidic; peat filtration being be very beneficial in helping to create the ideal environment. Provide these fish with a surfeit of retreats, and ironically you will actually see more of them, as they will be much more confident in venturing out and about, knowing they can quickly dart to safety if need be.

Although Peacock Gudgeon can sometimes be a little territorial with their own kind, keeping them in groups of 6 or more is recommended as they are naturally found in sizeable but loose aggregations. With plenty of hiding places and visual barriers within the aquarium, any territorial squabbles will be diminished, and should go no further than flaring the gills and fins. A larger group also means that you are more likely to obtain both sexes, and when in breeding condition, the males vying for the attention of the females makes for a wonderful display. Ideal tankmates could include peaceable species such as smaller rainbowfish, rasboras, and tetras.

Caves are absolutely essential to the spawning process, so these must be provided, whether constructed from small rocks or short pieces of PVC pipework, and, if the fish have been moved to a dedicated breeding tank, the addition of some clumps of plants will be much appreciated to provide additional cover. Plenty of small partial water changes should trigger the well-conditioned fish into spawning \"\u201c gravid female fish appear very swollen in the belly at this stage from all the eggs. Male fish will display at the entrances of their preferred caves, flaring their fins at suitable passing females and trying to coax them into the cave. If the male is successful, the female will enter the cave with him and lay her eggs on the ceiling as he simultaneously fertilises them (the eggs are attached to the roof of the cave via small adhesive threads). Once the female is spent of eggs, the male will force her out from the cave, and takes on brood care, constantly fanning at them with his pectoral fins to keep the water around them well oxygenated. If this has taken place in a tank where other fish are present, these should be carefully moved to other quarters to prevent predation on the eggs/fry. The eggs should hatch within 3-6 days (temperature dependent) and at this point, the male fish will cease caring for them and is best moved to another aquarium. The fry become free-swimming within a further 36-48 hours, initially requiring infusoria, moving on to baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) within a couple of days.",

Providing surface cover in the form of floating plant species will help provide the right conditions for breeding. It is essential that the aquarium has a tight fitting lid as these fishes are expert jumpers, and a small gap must be left between the surface of the water and the coverslides in order for the fish to come up and take in humid air. Using a tall aquarium with a low water level planted in a paludarium style, greatly reduces the likelihood of jumping, as well as providing plenty of surface cover and natural control of dissolved wastes. Snakeheads are obligate air breathers, which means they must have access to atmospheric air or they will drown.\nYoung pulchra snakeheads may be kept in groups until two fish pair up, after which they'll usually prove compatible in the longer term in the right set up. These fish are best maintained in a species-only aquarium, if tankmates are desired, they must be able to tolerate the seasonally low winter temperatures required as this species needs a seasonal change in temperature and maintenance to emulate the wet and dry months. During the winter period that coincides with the dry season, the fishes' metabolism will slow down and they will not show much interest in food. The water level can be dropped, the day length should be shortened and the reduction in waste levels means that water changes can be dramatically reduced. These annual rest periods seem to be imperative for long-term health, vitality, and breeding potential.\nConfusion is possible with Channa ornatipinnis, which has larger spots and a more spotted dorsal fin.",

This elongate bottom-dweller makes an unusual addition to the peaceful fish community where there are no small fish present. The aquarium should have a soft sand substrate so that these diggers can bury themselves, and plenty of hiding places amongst plant thickets, bogwood, smooth rocky caves, PVC pipes and so on. Larger specimens are capable of undermining the decor, so do ensure everything is well supported and secure (many aquarists like to place the decor on the base of the aquarium prior to adding substrate around it). Indian Almond Leaves (Terminalia catappa) are also very much appreciated as 'leaf litter', but these must be replaced on a regular basis as they gradually decompose. The footprint (length and width) of the tank is much more important than the height. Lighting should be diffused with the use of floating plants, and it is also a good idea to use a blue moon light timed to come on just before the main lights go out, so that you can view the antics of these nocturnal creatures under their preferred dimly lit conditions. Although they tend to stay buried for much of the day with just their snouts protruding from the cover, they do become very active at night. Be sure that the aquarium has no gaps at the top, as these fish are great escape artists. Peacock Spiny Eels are not aggressive, but adults are capable of taking small fish overnight, so tankmates must be chosen with care. Neon Tetra sized fish, for example, are not recommended.

A voluminous aquarium with powerful filtration to match is required if you wish to keep this large, solitary fish. The length and width of the tank is generally much more important than the height, providing as much surface area as possible, allowing for the arowana to turn freely. The aquarium must be biologically mature before adding this species. Decor is not critical, and would mainly be included for the benefit of large, robust fish living at lower levels which may prefer some shelter.

Several huge canister filters can be employed, but sump filtration may be more prudent as then equipment such as heaters can be kept in the sump and out of the main tank where they would be very easily damaged. The Pearl Arowana is belligerent and highly territorial with its own kind, so should only ever be kept singly in an aquarium. Tankmates must be chosen with care, as arowanas have deceptively capacious mouths and will eat any fish small enough to swallow. Most arowanas will tolerate large, robust companions that occupy the lower levels, such as big armoured catfish, large characins and cyprinids, sizeable cichlids, or stingrays. However, always introduce all intended tankmates first, the arowana being the very last addition, as otherwise it can be extremely territorial when introducing new fish into what it perceives as its established domain. It is also worth bearing in mind that individual arowanas do vary in personality and some will simply not accept tankmates.

The male and female will gather together underneath the nest, and the spawning will occur as the male wraps his body around the female, who releases hundreds of eggs as he simultaneously fertilises them. The eggs float to the surface and are herded into the bubblenest by the male, who commences his \"guard duty\". The female should be removed and acclimatised back to the main aquarium at this point. After approximately 4 days, the fry become free-swimming and the male should be removed. The young may be fed on small amounts of liquid egg-layer first foods or infusoria several times per day, moving on to slightly larger food (such as baby brineshrimp) after a fortnight. It is important to carry out small daily water changes on the fry aquarium in order to prevent losses due to the build up of excessive waste levels, to which they are particularly sensitive. It is crucial that a warm layer of air is maintained between the surface of the water and the coverslides at all times whilst the fry are developing their labyrinth organ, critical during the first few weeks of their life.

These cichlids feed primarily on molluscs (which they suck out from their shells) but also take insect larvae and small fish. The aquarium that houses this energetic species should be at least 6ft long, with a good amount of filtration, water movement and oxygenation. The best choice of substrate would be coral sand or aragonite, which will help to keep the water hard and alkaline. Rocks should be used to create small outcrops, crevices, and caves, ensuring that there are ample visual barriers - but do also leave generous expanses of sand. Hardy plants could also be incorporated into the aquascape if desired. Pearl-lined Cichlids can be moderately aggressive towards one another in the confines of the home aquarium, so broken lines of sight amongst the decor will help. These cichlids can be maintained in a species-only aquarium or as part of a Tanganyikan community with fish of similar size and temperament. However, if a breeding pair forms within the group, they can become much more territorially aggressive, and it is often best to move them to a tank of their own at this stage. Combining Pearl-lined Cichlids with other species does not always work in the long run, as their breeding strategy of producing large numbers with generations of juveniles defending their burgeoning family and ever-growing home territory, will eventually leave no room for outsiders. Pearl-lined Cichlids are intolerant of poor water conditions, so ensure small partial water changes are carried out on a frequent basis. May also be seen on sale as the Fourspine Cichlid.",

In the wild, spawning occurs in the females' preferred cave. The same process frequently occurs in the home aquarium, with the ripe female leading the chosen male from his territory to her cave. Other times, the pair may be seen excavating a cave from scratch. The female then deposits her eggs (averaging around 150-200) on the sides of the cave, the male immediately swimming over them and fertilising with his sperm. It is not always obvious when these fish have spawned, as oftentimes they are very secretive and the cave may be hidden from view. Once spawning has finished, the female will tend to the eggs, with the male fish guarding the perimeter of the cave. The eggs should hatch within 3-4 days (temperature dependent), with the fry becoming free swimming some 6-9 days later. The young can be started off on a diet of freshly hatched brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and finely powdered \"\u02dcfirst foods\"\u2122. Brood care is fairly prolonged, and the immature offspring may then help in guarding the subsequent generation of fry, coexisting within the same aquarium and forming a nuclear family. The cycle continues as the adults spawn again, and it is possible to have several generations living together.",

        "care": "The Pearlscale is a selectively bred strain of goldfish, with one of the most extreme body shapes and distinctive raised (pearl) scales. Domesticated goldfish date back to China's Ming dynasty and Fancy goldfish have long been popular aquarium pets, although often as a first venture into keeping an aquarium. This is a mixed blessing, as there are far better choices for small aquaria than these big, messy fishes. Given appropriate housing and care, fancy goldfish can attain a large size and easily live for more than 15-20 years. The aquarium should be spacious and ideally around 1.2 metres long to allow room for 20cm adults to be comfortable. The length and width of the tank are much more important than the height in this respect.\nFancy goldfish grow quickly so it is best to provide them with the largest aquarium that you can from the outset to provide a much safe, stable environment for them. The larger the volume of water, the more stable it will be in terms of water chemistry and temperature. During the warmer months, these fish can be kept outside in raised water features suitably filtered and protected from predators. This can be a great way to provide extra room for your pets and they'll benefit from the semi-natural conditions. Like any goldfish, fancies will benefit from a seasonal drop in temperature and this can be provided by either moving them indoors in late autumn, or positioning their aquarium in a room that experiences cool room temperatures during the winter. Fancy goldfish are notoriously messy fish; they are voracious eaters and continually stir up the substrate in their ongoing search for food. Such considerable amounts of waste can lead to water quality issues in smaller aquaria if not monitored very closely. Efficient filtration that can handle copius solids is essential, and weekly partial water changes are advised in order to keep nitrate to a minimum. The water should be well-oxygenated (of particular importance during warmer spells of weather) and this is easily achieved by the use of spray-bar returns from filters or the use of an air pumps. Various species of robust plants can be added to the aquarium, but these will likely require periodic replacement due to them being uprooted/eaten - something most goldfish keepers accept and allow their fish to take pleasure in. The substrate can consist of rounded fine gravel or sand, and decor can include smooth rocks and ornaments with no sharp edges. Pearlscales are sociable creatures and should be kept in groups, either with their own kind or with other varieties of fancy goldfish. It is best, however, to avoid keeping the standard 'single-tailed' common goldfish alongside the fancy varieties as the common goldfish is a faster swimmer and may outcompete the fancies at feeding time. Several colour varieties of Pearlscale are available, including black, red, red and white, yellow, and calico. There is also a strain called the Hamanishiki or Crown Pearlscale, which develops a hood similar to those seen on Orandas.",
        "feeding": "Due to their body shape, these fish need a high fibre diet and digestive problems are often the cause of buoyancy issues as transit times are compromised by convoluted digestive tracts. Goldfish also tend to swallow air in their rush to feed which also leads to problems which are best avoided by the use of sinking foods. These can be in the form of pellets, sticks or flake presented beneath the water surface. Frozen foods or live foods such as bloodworm, Mysis, and Daphnia will provide fibre and can be fed extensively to individuals displaying issues that are often categorised as Swim Bladder Disease. The opportunity to browse on aquatic plants will help to ensure gut health.",
        "breeding": "Well-conditioned fancy goldfish will often spawn in the home aquarium. Female fish will be noticeably rounder bellied when full of eggs, and the male fish will develop spawning tubercles (tiny raised bumps) on the gill plates and pectoral fins. A large, slightly cooler water change is often enough to trigger ready pairs into spawning. As the temperature slowly rises back up to its usual level, the male will pursue the female around the aquarium, but generally in a non-aggressive manner. This courtship ritual may last more than a day before spawning commences, and the colours of the fish often intensify at this time. The male fish will nudge the female into the fine-leaved plants (or spawning mops), where she will then scatter eggs which the male simultaneously fertilises. Spawning can last for a number of hours, and several thousand adhesive eggs may be scattered over the plants/spawning mop. The adults will be hungry and will start to devour as many eggs as they can find, so are best moved to another aquarium. The eggs take 4-5 days to hatch, depending on water temperature. Young fancy goldfish are often brown in colour (like their ancestors) and it can take up to a year before full colouration becomes apparent. Fancy goldfish often produce young that differ from their parents - high quality fish that show the best attributes of their breed are normally in the minority, hence the differences in price and quality between fish.",

To ensure their whiskers remain in good condition, these catfishes should be kept on a soft sand substrate which they will sift tirelessly for anything edible. This trait has led to them being recommended to clean up uneaten food but care must be taken to make sure that they get properly fed on a range of sinking foods. These sociable species should be maintained in groups of five or more due to their shoaling nature. Some shady planted areas should be provided. Corydoras have the ability to breathe air intestinally, so a small gap should be left between the surface of the water and the cover slides in order for the fish to come up to the surface and take air in. A quirky feature of these catfish is their ability to move their eyes in what looks like a winking motion. Wild specimens are something of a rarity in the trade but are seen from time to time - they often have more metallic colouration and the males sport high dorsal fins. As their native range extends further south than many tropical species, Peppered corys are happy to live at cooler temperatures and are a good choice for unheated aquaria.\nAn albino form is also seen and this can be distinguished from the more frequently seen O. aeneus albino by the presence of iridescent blue markings. Males of many strains have higher dorsals and this is especially the case in the selectively bred hi-fin and long-fin forms. \n  Taxonomic revision has seen this species moved out of the genus Corydoras and into Hoplisoma although it may be a further 190 years before any new name is embraced by a trade that has seen no previous change to this long-established binomial!",

Here the water is very soft and acidic, and darkly stained with tannins from the peat and decomposing leaves that have fallen into the water from the canopy above.

Here they will wait for small fish or shrimps to come within striking distance, at once rapidly extending their highly protrusible jaws, and instantly engulfing their prey. These labyrinth fish are best maintained in a large, mature species-only aquarium with gentle current. A dark substrate and an abundance of plant life will help to make these fish feel secure; floating species useful in helping to diffuse the aquarium lighting. Include some driftwood (the spindly Sumatra wood is ideal) to create shady hiding places and visual barriers. Peat filtration is highly recommended. These fish are best kept in small groups (3-5) but they must be of the same size and introduced simultaneously; this is not only more natural for them, but will also further your chances of breeding success. Do not keep with small fish. Tankmates, if they absolutely must be added, must be very peaceful (so as not to intimidate the pikeheads) and of at least the same adult length.

The pair will select a spawning site, typically a flat piece of decor, and again the female will pose in front of the male, nudging him whilst circling around him and flaring her gills. During this time of courtship, other fish will be chased away. When ready to spawn, the colours of the male will intensify along the throat and flanks, yet he will lighten along the dorsal surface. He will then begin to circle with the female and eventually they will embrace, curling their tails around one another and quivering. The female will release her large sized white eggs onto the pre-chosen spawning site, and these are instantly fertilised by the male. He will then slowly and methodically take the eggs up into his mouth whilst the female watches on. The male will hold the eggs in his mouth for around 30 days before the fully-formed fry are released. He will not attempt to eat during this time. The fry must be separated from the adults once they are released, to avoid falling victim to predation.",

There should be a decent level of oxygenation, and small frequent partial water changes will help keep nitrate to a minimum. The Peppermint Plec is generally peaceful, but it will show some territorial aggression towards its own kind if not given enough space.

Although a substrate of coral sand or Aragonite is often recommended to help to keep the water hard and alkaline, Mbuna feel safer and show better colours over a darker substrate. The Aragonite or coral sand can always be placed into a mesh bag and kept inside the external filter for buffering purposes. This is a relatively peaceful species (as far as Malawi cichlids are concerned), however, it is best to keep several females to each male, as keeping in pairs will result in continual harassment.

As the Synodontis eggs hatch more quickly than the cichlid eggs, the young catfish consume all the cichlid eggs, leaving the unsuspecting adult cichlid to guard the catfish fry as if they were its own. In the aquarium, well-conditioned S. petricola will breed via the egg scattering method. The spawning clinch follows a period of excited chasing from the male fish, with the eggs being deposited on the substrate or in a cave. The eggs should hatch within 24 hours, with the fry becoming free-swimming some 48-72 hours later.",

Smaller fishes should not be housed with Pignose Puffers as they will be seen as a quick meal by these ambush predators. It is best to keep 5 or more Pignose Puffers, rather than just 2 or 3, as this will help to spread any the load of any occasional territorial argument amongst the group. Due to the fairly large adult size of the Pignose Puffer, they should be maintained in spacious aquaria with plenty of shady hiding spots/visual barriers amongst rocky caves (allow more than one cave per fish). Lighting should not be too bright, and the substrate should be smooth because of the puffers will spend the majority of their time laying on or in it in an almost motionless fashion. However, they soon 'come to life' when it is feeding time and will venture out in a very eager fashion when the keeper approaches the tank with the food container. When keeping multiple specimens, it is best to distribute the food as evenly around the tank as possible, so that there is less chance of the puffers accidentally biting each other when lunging for a morsel of food. Once feeding time is over, the puffers tend to retreat once more to a resting position in their chosen territory. These fish can consume a lot of food in one sitting, so ensure that powerful filtration and aeration is used to cope with the metabolic rate. Occasional territorial arguments will inevitably occur, and when this happens, the two puffers concerned will horizontally flatten their bodies and lower their heads, cautiously swimming around each other in a circle in an attempt to see the other one off. Biting may occur, but this is a rare occurrence and is not usually too serious, particularly if tip-top water quality is maintained. If a group is to be kept, it is best to introduce them simultaneously to avoid any newcomers being set upon. As with other puffer species, this fish can inflate when frightened or cornered. It should never be provoked into doing so, and never above water where it can take on air, which can prove fatal. If moving a Pignose Puffer to larger quarters, the fish should be herded into a solid container under the water so as to remove the necessity of netting and lifting it clear of the water. Please remember that pufferfish can vary in temperament, and there may be exceptions to the expected behaviour of the species. It is always a good idea to have some sort of tank divider - or even a spare aquarium - handy, should circumstances necessitate their use. Intolerant of poor water quality - as already mentioned above, make use of a decent filtration system and perform plenty of regular partial water changes.

        "breeding": "These fish have been spawned in captivity. It is best to purchase a group of 5 or more fish and observe for any natural pairing. Following an elaborate courtship ritual, which can last some days and includes inflation by both male and female, the pair will usually choose a cave site in which to spawn and a pit will be created. It is noteworthy that some aquarists have observed their Pignose Puffers cleaning flat pieces of slate as spawning sites too, those of which have usually been located in shadier areas of the aquarium. Not a huge amount is known about the actual egg laying & fertilisation, but it is thought that the female deposits the adhesive eggs on the chosen substrate, which the male then passes over and fertilises. After this occurs, all brood care is carried out by the male and he will defend vigorously against any would-be predators, including the female. The eggs (clear and 2mm in size) are said to hatch within 6-7 days, and after a further 48 hours, the fry will be free-swimming. The fry, much like the parents, will not actively seek out food, but will instead wait for it to flow past them, when they will snatch it up. They can be started on infusoria and newly-hatched brineshrimp, and then moved on to larger foodstuffs such as cyclops and daphnia as they grow. Unfortunately, there can be a large number of casualties as there tends to be much aggression between the youngsters, particularly once the dentition becomes more developed.",

        "care": "Pike cichlids are a fascinating group of elongate predatory South American cichlids previously belonging to the Crenicichla genus. Most species are found in the Amazonian region where they inhabit freshwater lakes, pools, rivers, and streams, but they have representatives over nearly all of the South American continent. To the north, they are found in Colombia (but not west of the Andes), Guyana, Venezuela, and the island of Trinidad. To the south, they are found all the way down to the central R\u00c3\u00ado Negro province of Argentina, just north of Patagonia. The majority of pike cichlids are warm water fish that require tropical temperatures in the home aquarium, but there are a few notable exceptions to this rule, for example some of the subtropical Argentine species. It is important that each species is researched thoroughly prior to purchase to ensure their individual requirements can be met. The aquarium should be as spacious as possible; the exact size will obviously depend on which species you plan to keep (and how many), but it should provide ample room for fish to set up their territories. A soft sand substrate will be beneficial, as many species like to dig a little now and again - although Pike cichlids do not generally tend to rearrange the decor anywhere near as much as many other cichlid families. It is important to furnish the tank with a plethora of hiding places and visual barriers, which will enable multiple specimens to be kept together. Tangles of driftwood, rocky caves and crevices, PVC or bamboo tubes (allow several per fish) etc will all be much appreciated. Hardy plants can usually be incorporated into the aquascape, but as some species do like to engage in a bit of digging, it may be prudent to opt for Java Fern and Anubias sp. which can be tied on and cultivated on the decor, as well as floating species to help diffuse the light. Filtration should be efficient, with areas of moderate water movement along with some quieter resting spots out of the current. Small, regular water changes will help to keep nitrate to a minimum. Pike Cichlids have something of a reputation for being nasty. Whilst it is true that they are predatory (they have large protrusible mouths and will attempt to eat fish that are just a bit smaller than themselves) and most are highly territorially aggressive towards conspecifics, there are several ways of reducing the risk of violence in the aquarium. The first is to provide a multitude of visual barriers as described above; broken lines of sight will significantly reduce territorial aggression. Secondly, when purchasing your preferred species of Pike Cichlid, buy a group of reasonable number that are all of the same size, and introduce them to the aquarium simultaneously. Thirdly, these fish are always best kept in a species tank environment, but if tankmates really are desired, ensure the tank is voluminous and companions are robust and as large (or larger) than the pikes, and add them first so that the pikes have not already set up territories and see them as intruders into their established domain. Lastly, bear in mind that if a pair forms and they show signs of wanting to spawn, aggression will heighten even further - and unless the tank is exceptionally spacious, the other fish may need rehoming for their own safety.",
        "feeding": "Offer a variety of meaty frozen foods such as white mosquito larvae, bloodworm, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, Mysis etc. As the majority of fish are wild caught, they may require live foods to initiate a feeding response, gradually weaning on to frozen fare, and some will eventually take dried foods such as cichlid pellets.",

The young can be rather cannibalistic, with larger fry predating on smaller fry, so be sure to regularly separate the young by size for their safety.",

Here the water is very soft and acidic, and darkly stained with tannins from the peat and decomposing leaves that have fallen into the water from the canopy above. These predatory fish lurk amongst live and fallen vegetation, slowly drifting about in the water, putting one in mind of a floating twig. Here they will wait for small fish or shrimps to come within striking distance, at once rapidly extending their highly protrusible jaws, and instantly engulfing their prey. These piscivorous labyrinth fish are best maintained in a large, mature species-only aquarium with gentle current. A dark substrate and an abundance of plant life will help to make these fish feel secure; floating species useful in helping to diffuse the aquarium lighting. Include some driftwood (the spindly Sumatra wood is ideal) to create shady hiding places and visual barriers. Peat filtration is highly recommended. These fish are best kept in small groups (3-5) but they must be of the same size and introduced simultaneously; this is not only more natural for them, but will also further your chances of breeding success. Tankmates - if they absolutely must be added - should be very peaceful (so as not to intimidate the pikeheads) and of at least the same adult length. The mouths of Pikeheads are extremely deceptive - they are capable of swallowing prey that is more than 1/3 to 1/2 of their body length. Tight fitting coverslides are essential as these fish are accomplished jumpers. Regular partial water changes are a must in order to maintain the consistent high water quality required. Not recommended for beginners. This species can be differentiated from its close relative L. aura by its larger adult size and lack of peppermint coloured spots along the flanks.",
        "feeding": "Offer a variety of meaty frozen foods such as Mysis shrimp, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, bloodworm, white mosquito larvae, chopped prawns etc. Newly imported fish may require live river shrimp or crickets, weaning them onto frozen foods over time.

Pikeheads have bred in the home aquarium, but this is a rare event (with details few and far between) and so would make a great breeding project for the serious hobbyist. Very soft, acidic water is required. The male mouthbroods the eggs for around 30 days before the fully-formed fry are released. He will not attempt to eat during this time.

It belongs to the Mbuna group of cichlids. The aquarium should be at least 5ft long and aquascaped to emulate a rocky reef effect with some open expanses of sand. D\u00c3\u00a9cor such as ocean rock can be used to build sturdy structures which stretch from the base of the tank to near the surface of the water. These structures should be built with the purpose of creating many crevices for the fish to explore but constructed in such a way so as to keep the rocks stable if the fish start to dig around and underneath them. Although a substrate of coral sand or Aragonite is often recommended to help to keep the water hard and alkaline, Mbuna feel safer and show better colours over a darker substrate. The Aragonite or coral sand can always be placed into a mesh bag and kept inside the external filter for buffering purposes. This is a relatively peaceful species (as far as Malawi cichlids are concerned), however, it is best to keep several females to each male, as keeping in pairs will result in continual harassment. This species can be kept successfully alongside Aulonocara, Copadichromis, Haps, and other easygoing Mbuna such as Labidochromis caeruleus, making it a versatile addition for many Malawi set-ups. However, it is best to avoid fish with a similar colour pattern. Interestingly, individuals from some geographical populations lack the submarginal black band on the dorsal fin. May also be seen on sale as the Pindani Mbuna or Powder Blue Cichlid. An albino form is commonly seen, generally labelled as Snow White zebra.",
        "feeding": "The diet should be primarily vegetarian. Foods rich in animal protein could cause Malawi Bloat, which can be fatal. A good quality Spirulina-based green flake should be mixed with a standard quality flake food, and offered along with appropriately sized granular foods specifically developed for Mbuna.

These are deposited just one or two at a time and after doing so, she immediately turns around and picks them up. At the same time, the male will rotate so that he is almost on his side, at the same time shaking and extending his anal fin, releasing his milt. The female sees the egg spots on the male\"\u2122s anal fin and attempts to pick up those \"\u0153eggs\"\u009d whilst she is picking up the real ones that she deposited, and at the same time taking in milt.

        "care": "The Pearlscale is a selectively bred strain of goldfish, with one of the most extreme body shapes and distinctive raised (pearl) scales. Domesticated goldfish date back to China's Ming dynasty and Fancy goldfish have long been popular aquarium pets, although often as a first venture into keeping an aquarium. This is a mixed blessing, as there are far better choices for small aquaria than these big, messy fishes. Given appropriate housing and care, fancy goldfish can attain a large size and easily live for more than 15-20 years. The aquarium should be spacious and ideally around 1.2 metres long to allow room for 20cm adults to be comfortable. The length and width of the tank are much more important than the height in this respect.\nFancy goldfish grow quickly so it is best to provide them with the largest aquarium that you can from the outset to provide a much safe, stable environment for them. The larger the volume of water, the more stable it will be in terms of water chemistry and temperature. During the warmer months, these fish can be kept outside in raised water features suitably filtered and protected from predators. This can be a great way to provide extra room for your pets and they'll benefit from the semi-natural conditions. Like any goldfish, fancies will benefit from a seasonal drop in temperature and this can be provided by either moving them indoors in late autumn, or positioning their aquarium in a room that experiences cool room temperatures during the winter. Fancy goldfish are notoriously messy fish; they are voracious eaters and continually stir up the substrate in their ongoing search for food. Such considerable amounts of waste can lead to water quality issues in smaller aquaria if not monitored very closely. Efficient filtration that can handle copius solids is essential, and weekly partial water changes are advised in order to keep nitrate to a minimum. The water should be well-oxygenated (of particular importance during warmer spells of weather) and this is easily achieved by the use of spray-bar returns from filters or the use of an air pumps. Various species of robust plants can be added to the aquarium, but these will likely require periodic replacement due to them being uprooted/eaten - something most goldfish keepers accept and allow their fish to take pleasure in. The substrate can consist of rounded fine gravel or sand, and decor can include smooth rocks and ornaments with no sharp edges. Pearlscales are sociable creatures and should be kept in groups, either with their own kind or with other varieties of fancy goldfish. It is best, however, to avoid keeping the standard 'single-tailed' common goldfish alongside the fancy varieties as the common goldfish is a faster swimmer and may outcompete the fancies at feeding time.\nPing Pong Pearlscales are one of the most exaggerated forms of these distinctive fish and usually come in red & white but other colours are available including black, red and calico.",
        "feeding": "Due to their body shape, these fish need a high fibre diet and digestive problems are often the cause of buoyancy issues as transit times are compromised by convoluted digestive tracts. Goldfish also tend to swallow air in their rush to feed which also leads to problems which are best avoided by the use of sinking foods. These can be in the form of pellets, sticks or flake presented beneath the water surface. Frozen foods or live foods such as bloodworm, Mysis, and Daphnia will provide fibre and can be fed extensively to individuals displaying issues that are often categorised as Swim Bladder Disease. The opportunity to browse on aquatic plants will help to ensure gut health.",
        "breeding": "Well-conditioned fancy goldfish will often spawn in the home aquarium. Female fish will be noticeably rounder bellied when full of eggs, and the male fish will develop spawning tubercles (tiny raised bumps) on the gill plates and pectoral fins. A large, slightly cooler water change is often enough to trigger ready pairs into spawning. As the temperature slowly rises back up to its usual level, the male will pursue the female around the aquarium, but generally in a non-aggressive manner. This courtship ritual may last more than a day before spawning commences, and the colours of the fish often intensify at this time. The male fish will nudge the female into the fine-leaved plants (or spawning mops), where she will then scatter eggs which the male simultaneously fertilises. Spawning can last for a number of hours, and several thousand adhesive eggs may be scattered over the plants/spawning mop. The adults will be hungry and will start to devour as many eggs as they can find, so are best moved to another aquarium. The eggs take 4-5 days to hatch, depending on water temperature. Young fancy goldfish are often brown in colour (like their ancestors) and it can take up to a year before full colouration becomes apparent. Fancy goldfish often produce young that differ from their parents - high quality fish that show the best attributes of their breed are normally in the minority, hence the differences in price and quality between fish.",

An aquarium that is 150cm/5ft in length really is considered the bare minimum for this species, and tankmates should be robust with large barbs such as Tigers (Puntigris) a good choice, although this practically toothless fish isn't much of a predator. A small gap must be left between the waters\"\u2122 surface and the coverslides in order for the fish to breathe atmospheric air from time to time.

This large, streamlined, silvery characin, with its eye-catching bright pink tail, is an active species that occurs in the upper levels of the water column, and at times may be observed jumping clear of the water in pursuit of food (small fishes, insects, insect larvae etc). Pink-tail Chalceus can attain a very large size. An aquarium that is a minimum of 4ft in length is suitable for small juveniles, but before long they will require a tank at least 6\" x 2\" x 2\"  and ideally, much, much larger. Pink-tail Chalceus are a timid, shoaling species that should be maintained in groups of 6 or more in an appropriately sized aquarium. Smaller groups will not work, as the fish will squabble fiercely with one another. The aquarium itself should be sited in a quiet location where it does not receive a large amount of foot traffic going past all the time. These are very skittish fish that are easily startled, so they must be provided with many shady hiding spots within the aquarium and some very sturdy/weighty tight-fitting coverslides to prevent them from accidentally jumping out. Decor must be chosen with care as anything sharp can cause them injury whenever they decide to make a dash for cover; a sandy substrate with smooth pieces of driftwood and water-worn rocks is ideal. The aquarium should be planted with robust species (such as Anubias spp. and Java Fern) at the sides and back, leaving a generously-sized open swimming area in the centre. Some tough floating vegetation can also be grown over the calmer areas of the aquarium and will provide natural surface cover, which should help to reduce skittishness. When cleaning the aquarium, much care must be taken to ensure that the fish do not become too startled - keep hand movements slow etc. It is essential that the aquarium housing Pink-tail Chalceus is well-filtered via external canisters and very well-aerated, perhaps using additional powerheads and placing any spray-bar returns from filters just above the water line to create turbulence. These riverine fish will not cope with a build up of nitrogenous waste, so aim for high water quality at all times with partial water changes carried out on a very regular basis. Tankmates should be of similar size and temperament - good companions could include large but fairly peaceable cichlids e.g. Geophagus or Satanoperca, Leporinus, Metynnis (silver dollars), mochokid, pimelodid and loricariid catfish. Other fish that prefer to inhabit the upper levels of the aquarium are best avoided as adult C. macrolepidotus can be rather territorial. Smaller fish will be eaten.

        "care": "A fish with a very long aquarium history, the Southern platyfish or Moon platy found its way to Europe around 1900 and was soon bred into a range of colour forms that are remarkably different from their drabber wild ancestors. Their ability to hybridise with closely related species such as Swordtails, as well as Variatus platies, made the transfer of characteristics possible and now there's a huge overlap between all of these fishes. This can be seen in the number of breeds which have both platy and swordtail forms, such as red, calico, red wagtail, comet etc. This makes the use of scientific names a little complex for these fishes and it may be best to view all but the most primitive of breeds as Xiphophorus hybrids.  \nWild platies are found in slow-moving habitats with plenty of vegetation, normally in areas where the local geology means that conditions are hard and alkaline. Despite over a century of domestication, they remain fishes of hard water and will struggle in acidic conditions.\nIn typical livebearer fashion males can be persistent, and these sociable fish are best kept in groups where males are outnumbered by females. As well as courting females, males will display and pursue their rivals and are best kept in odd numbers in small aquaria where this behaviour may otherwise lead to constant friction between two evenly matched fishes. As females will produce fry regularly after a single mating, it's best to keep a group of males if breeding is to be avoided. Despite wild fish having two accepted common names, most of the time you'll see aquarium forms described by their colour or breed. All of these are compatible and will happily mix, making a community of platies one of the most diverse and varied of any aquarium fish. In these mixed situations, fry may be very different to their parents thanks to the potential for cross breeding and the number of genes involved in all of these colour and finnage forms.",

        "breeding": "Very easy. Platies are livebearers, which means that the females give birth to live young. After fertilisation occurs, the female gestates for 25-30 days, after which time she will give birth to between 20 and 80 free-swimming fry. Females store sperm and one mating will give rise to multiple broods. The adults (and other fish species in the aquarium) will predate on the fry if not separated. However, a few will normally manage to survive onto adulthood when kept in a well planted aquarium with lots of natural hiding places. At the lower end of their temperature range, breeding becomes less frequent and this may be a useful way to slow down population growth.",

It is present in Pool Malebo (Stanley Pool) and also the drainages of the Kasai and the Ubangi. This is a large species of Synodontis which requires a spacious aquarium with a soft sandy substrate in order to protect the long sensory barbels. It should be decorated with a good amount of bogwood, rocky caves/PVC tubes, and robust planting to provide shady areas/visual barriers, but you should also ensure that a roomy swimming space is left along the front of the tank. External canister filtration is recommended, as these fish are voracious eaters and can produce a fair amount of waste. The water should be well-oxygenated with a moderate current, and frequent partial water changes are a must to help keep nitrate to a minimum. Polka Dot Catfish are most comfortable in aquaria with subdued lighting, and the use of blue-moon type illumination is highly recommended so that you may observe a few hours of the nightly goings-on in an aquarium containing these catfish. Ensure that heaters are covered with heater guards to prevent these catfish from being burned when looking for dark crevices to rest against. As it matures, S. angelicus can become somewhat quarrelsome towards conspecifics and closely related fish, so is usually best kept singly unless the aquarium is vast and there are a multitude of visual barriers. Companions should be peaceful and larger than 5cm (2\") in length (otherwise they may be predated upon); good tankmates could include medium-large sized barbs and characins, adult rainbowfish, gouramis, large peaceable cichlids, or Loricariids.

        "care": "The Pompom is a selectively bred double tailed strain of the common Goldfish that develops loose fleshy 'bouquets' from the nasal flanges that all goldfish possess. Two forms are known, with or without dorsal fins. Domesticated goldfish date back to China\"\u2122s Ming dynasty and Fancy goldfish have long been popular aquarium pets, although often as a first venture into keeping an aquarium. This is a mixed blessing, as there are far better choices for small aquaria than these big, messy fishes. Given appropriate housing and care, fancy goldfish can attain a large size and easily live for more than 15-20 years. The aquarium should be spacious and ideally around 1.2 metres long to allow room for 30cm adults to be comfortable. The length and width of the tank are much more important than the height in this respect.\nFancy goldfish grow quickly so it is best to provide them with the largest aquarium that you can from the outset to provide a much safe, stable environment for them. The larger the volume of water, the more stable it will be in terms of water chemistry and temperature. During the warmer months, these fish can be kept outside in raised water features suitably filtered and protected from predators. This can be a great way to provide extra room for your pets and they\"\u2122ll benefit from the semi-natural conditions. Like any goldfish, fancies will benefit from a seasonal drop in temperature and this can be provided by either moving them indoors in late autumn, or positioning their aquarium in a room that experiences cool room temperatures during the winter. Fancy goldfish are notoriously messy fish; they are voracious eaters and continually stir up the substrate in their ongoing search for food. Such considerable amounts of waste can lead to water quality issues in smaller aquaria if not monitored very closely. Efficient filtration that can handle copius solids is essential, and weekly partial water changes are advised in order to keep nitrate to a minimum. The water should be well-oxygenated (of particular importance during warmer spells of weather) and this is easily achieved by the use of spray-bar returns from filters or the use of an air pumps. Various species of robust plants can be added to the aquarium, but these will likely require periodic replacement due to them being uprooted/eaten - something most goldfish keepers accept and allow their fish to take pleasure in. The substrate can consist of rounded fine gravel or sand, and decor can include smooth rocks and ornaments with no sharp edges. Pompoms are sociable creatures and should be kept in groups, either with their own kind or with other varieties of fancy goldfish. It is best, however, to avoid keeping the standard 'single-tailed' common goldfish alongside the fancy varieties as the common goldfish is a faster swimmer and may outcompete the fancies at feeding time. Several colour varieties of these fish are available, including black, blue, chocolate, red, red and white, red cap, white, yellow, and calico. The pompoms themselves are often of a contrasting colour.",
        "feeding": "Due to their body shape, these fish need a high fibre diet and digestive problems are often the cause of buoyancy issues as transit times are compromised by convoluted digestive tracts. Goldfish also tend to swallow air in their rush to feed which also leads to problems which are best avoided by the use of sinking foods. These can be in the form of pellets, sticks or flake presented beneath the water surface. Frozen foods or live foods such as bloodworm, Mysis, and Daphnia will provide fibre and can be fed extensively to individuals displaying issues that are often categorised as Swim Bladder Disease. The opportunity to browse on aquatic plants will help to ensure gut health.",
        "breeding": "Well-conditioned fancy goldfish will often spawn in the home aquarium. Female fish will be noticeably rounder bellied when full of eggs, and the male fish will develop spawning tubercles (tiny raised bumps) on the gill plates and pectoral fins. A large, slightly cooler water change is often enough to trigger ready pairs into spawning. As the temperature slowly rises back up to its usual level, the male will pursue the female around the aquarium, but generally in a non-aggressive manner. This courtship ritual may last more than a day before spawning commences, and the colours of the fish often intensify at this time. The male fish will nudge the female into the fine-leaved plants (or spawning mops), where she will then scatter eggs which the male simultaneously fertilises. Spawning can last for a number of hours, and several thousand adhesive eggs may be scattered over the plants/spawning mop. The adults will be hungry and will start to devour as many eggs as they can find, so are best moved to another aquarium. The eggs take 4-5 days to hatch, depending on water temperature. Young fancy goldfish are often brown in colour (like their ancestors) and it can take up to a year before full colouration becomes apparent. Fancy goldfish often produce young that differ from their parents - high quality fish that show the best attributes of their breed are normally in the minority, hence the differences in price and quality between fish.",

        "care": "There are over 30 different species of aquatic snail native to the UK, and the majority are suitable for keeping in the garden pond. The most commonly traded pond snails are the air-breathing Lymnaea and Planorbis species, the latter commonly referred to as Ramshorn Snails. Some top out at just a few millimetres, with the largest species being the Great Pond Snail (Lymnaea stagnalis) which attains 6cm (2.4\"). Even if you don't add snails to the pond yourself, they often turn up of their own accord, with the adhesive eggs hitching a ride on aquatic plants, or perhaps transported via amphibians and the feet of birds. Whilst some species are considered more desirable than others, in general, pond snails can play an important beneficial role in your pond\"\u2122s ecosystem. However, it is essential to strike the right balance, being careful not to let numbers get out of hand; most pond snails are hermaphroditic and can reproduce quickly. Depending on the species, pond snails will consume various types of algae and decaying organic matter, and will aid in stirring up the sediment at the bottom of the pond (in turn helping to avoid stagnation), but many will also graze on soft-leaved aquatic plants if other foodstuffs become scarce. In larger, heavily planted ponds, aquatic snails are unlikely to cause major damage to your prized flora, but they can have a deleterious impact in smaller quarters with fewer plants if overpopulation occurs. Having said this, given a choice, most aquatic snails prefer soft nuisance algae, detritus, and decaying leaves over healthy aquatic vegetation, so for the most part they tend to consume those first. In smaller ponds with fewer plants, or in those with very little natural algae, you will need to ensure snail populations are kept in check, as otherwise their numbers will overwhelm the foliage and the plants may be unable to recover. Supplementing the diet with occasional feedings of green leafy vegetables (which some fish also enjoy) may also help to mitigate the problem, but do be sure to remove any uneaten food within a sensible timeframe so as not to foul the water. As wild snails are sometimes known to act as an intermediate host for various parasites that can be passed on to fish, we would always advise purchasing them from a reputable aquatic dealer/breeder, as this will significantly reduce the chances of them carrying parasites. Pictured above is a Ramshorn Snail (Planorbis sp.).",
        "feeding": "Pond snails will graze on various types of soft algae, detritus, decaying organic matter, and some soft-leaved plants. They will also feed on any leftover fish food that makes it to the bottom of the pond, as well as enjoying green leafy vegetables when offered occasionally.",
        "breeding": "Most of the air-breathing (pulmonate) species are hermaphroditic, whereas the gill-breathing (operculate) species tend to have separate sexes. In the case of the pulmonates, hermaphroditism brings about much faster rates of reproduction, with each individual snail able to fertilise and be fertilised by another of its own kind.",

When ready to spawn, the female moves into this area with the male and eggs are deposited on the ceiling. The male then remains in the cave and guards/fans the eggs.

There should be a soft sand substrate which will be kinder on the long sensory barbels and plenty of shady hiding places amongst bogwood, rocks, robust planting, and leaf litter. Porthole Catfish do like to dig, so be sure that all structures are secure. Filtration should be efficient, although water movement need not be too vigorous. Dim lighting is preferable; however, brighter illumination can be employed if it is diffused with floating plant species, and the use of a blue moon light is highly recommended for viewing this nocturnal species in the late evening time. A good maintenance and water change regime is a must, as these fish are sensitive to a build-up of organic wastes. Typical tankmates could include medium sized or deep bodied characins e.g. Bleeding Heart Tetras, Black Widow Tetras etc, Rainbowfish, medium-sized Rasbora species, Corydoras catfish, medium-sized Loricariids (suckermouth catfish), and more.

It is also found in the upper Lualaba (the headstream of the Congo River) and the Boyoma Falls (which lead from the Lualaba into the Congo River), in addition to the Kwilu River. Here, it is most commonly found in the fast-flowing, highly oxygenated sections of large rivers and rapids where it may be observed lurking between crevices in the rocks or riparian vegetation, ready to ambush any small fish or crustaceans that venture past.\nThe Potato Puffer requires a mature aquarium with a 2-3\" depth of sand substrate in which it can wallow, and a number of rocky caves and crevices to hide between. As these fish are voracious eaters and can create a fair amount of waste, decent filtration should be employed (an external canister is ideal). There should be areas of moderate water movement and a high level of oxygenation, perhaps achieved by a powerhead with flow diverter angled up towards the surface of the water, or by keeping a slightly dropped water line so that water returning from the filter splashes down onto the water's surface. Regular partial water changes are a must to help keep nitrate to a minimum, as these fish are particularly sensitive to the build up of pollutants. A Potato Puffer will not tolerate any other fish within the confines of the same aquarium, so each individual must be maintained as a solitary specimen in a species-only tank; indeed, it is not unknown for these predatory oddballs to 'go for' fish that can be seen in neighbouring aquariums. This fish will spend most of the day buried in the sand with just the eyes and mouth protruding, but the moment food is offered, it will exit the substrate with alarming speed to aggressively ambush its meal. The Potato Puffer is capable of dramatic colour change, and depending on its immediate surroundings, may appear brown, red, orange, yellow, cream, grey, black, or olive green - often mimicking algae-covered cobble stones on the river bed.\nAs with other puffer species, this fish can inflate when frightened or cornered. It should never be provoked into doing so, and never above water where it can take on air, which can prove fatal. If moving a Potato Puffer to larger quarters, the fish should be herded into a solid container under the water so as to remove the necessity of netting and lifting it clear of the water.

Dwarf cichlids from the Apistogramma or Mikrogeophagus genera could also be considered as good tankmates, as well as Corydoras catfish and small loricariids. Choose companions wisely as Pencilfish can be fairly timid and will hide away and refuse to feed if tankmates are too boisterous. If unfussy about creating an exact biotope, some of the smaller Rasbora and Boraras species from Asia would get along well with them, as would Kuhli loaches (Pangio spp.). The colours of these fish can vary slightly, as with other Nannostomus species, they assume a cryptic colour overnight so may look a little pale when the lights first switch on. Acclimatisation should be carried out very carefully, and be sure to keep up with small regular water changes to keep nitrogenous wastes at a minimum. Tight fitting coverslides are a must, as these fish are capable of jumping from an open topped aquarium.\n\nThe Purple pencilfish was only scientifically classified in 2009.

The eggs will be laid/fertilised a few at a time, and these should fall into the mass of plants or down into the safety of the marbles. This will continue until up the female is spent of eggs (eggs can number up to 100 per mature female), and the parents, being voracious egg-eaters, should be removed immediately. It should be noted that some aquarists find breeding is more successful with a single pair, rather than a group, as the smaller number of adult fish present will mean less chance of predation. The eggs should hatch after 36-72 hours (temperature dependent)  with the miniscule fry using up their yolk sacs and becoming free-swimming around 3-4 days later. Feed on infusoria, rotifers, and powdered first foods  to begin with, moving on to larger foods such as microworm and Artemia nauplii as they grow. It will take well-fed fry approximately 2 months to reach 1 cm (0.4\") in length, after which time they will begin to take on adult coloration.",

        "care": "The Pygmy Cory is a peaceful little species, ideally suited to smaller softwater aquaria. Due to its diminutive adult size, it is not suitable for the general community aquarium as it may be intimidated by or preyed upon by larger tankmates. Mature, densely planted nano tanks would be perfect for this pretty, shoaling catfish. There should be a sandy substrate in order to protect the delicate sensory barbels, and some shady hiding spots amongst driftwood and broad leaved plants. Floating plants can also be useful in helping to diffuse bright lighting. Peat filtration will help to keep the water soft and acidic, and the tannins released will result in the fish showing their best colours. Unusually for a Corydoras catfish, this delightful species spends a good deal of time hovering in midwater. Pygmy Cories should always be maintained in large sized groups of at least 10 specimens; this will not only give them more confidence, but will result in a more effective, natural-looking shoal. Other tankmates could include tiny sized characins such as Ember Tetras, micro Rasboras (Boraras spp.), or small ornamental shrimps such as Red Crystals or Cherries. Frequent partial water changes are a must, as these fish can be very sensitive to elevated nitrate levels. Corydoras have the ability to breathe air intestinally, so a small gap should be left between the surface of the water and the cover slides in order for the fish to come up to the surface and take air in. It may do this numerous times per day. This species may sometimes be confused with G. hastatus, but the two can be told apart fairly easily as G. pygmaeus has a dark stripe that runs along the entire length of the lateral line from the tip of the snout and onto the caudal fin (this is lacking in G. hastatus).\n\nGastrodermus was recently split from Corydoras and contains all the elegans group, together with the pygmy corys.",

        "breeding": "This species is said to be a little more difficult to breed than other members of the genus, as it can be difficult to raise the miniscule fry. It may be easier to attempt reproduction of this species in a dedicated breeding tank, set up with parameters matching the main tank but instead filtered by a small air driven sponge filter which should prevent any fry from being drawn in. A cooler water change may trigger your fish into spawning in the classic Corydoras \"T-position\". Soft, acidic water seems to be essential (peat filtration suggested) and a ratio of 2 males to every female tends to work best. The 1mm eggs (numbering up to 100 per female) are individually deposited, usually on the glass or amongst fine-leaved plants. Once spawning is over, the adults should be acclimatised back to the main aquarium, and the eggs can then be raised in the safety of the breeding tank, away from any predators. Many aquarists find that the addition of a small amount of methylene blue or an alder cone helps to prevent the eggs from fungussing, but any that do still fungus should be immediately removed to prevent it spreading to healthy eggs. A sand substrate actually seems to work better than a bare bottomed tank in preventing disease in this species. All being well, the eggs should hatch within 3 to 5 days, depending on water temperature. The fry will initially feed from their yolk sacs and can then be offered microscopic foodstuffs such as infusoria for the first few days, moving on to baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and microworms as they grow.",

Soft, acidic water is essential, and this can be helped along with the addition of peat to the aquarium filter. Dark decor and plenty of bogwood, caves, and planting - including floating species - will all help these fish to feel secure. It is imperative that the tank has tight fitting coverslides as these fish are highly skilled jumpers; and do ensure there are no escape holes where equipment feeds into the tank (block any gaps with filter sponge). Pygmy Hatchetfish are a timid shoaling species, which congregate in large numbers in nature; for this reason, they must be kept in groups of 6 or more (10+ is better) in order to feel secure and display natural behaviour. Tankmates must be small and peaceful, as Hatchetfish are easily intimidated. Good companions could include small peaceable tetras, pencilfish, Corydoras catfish, dwarf cichlids such as Apistogramma or Mikrogeophagus,  and some of the smaller Loricariidae (suckermouth catfish).

Soft, acidic water is essential. The fish should be well-conditioned on a diet of small fruitflies and black mosquito larvae, and following a lengthy courtship ritual, eggs should be laid on floating plants or plants growing near the water's surface. The parents will predate on the eggs/fry, so they should be acclimatised back to the main aquarium once spawning has ceased. Once the eggs have hatched, and the fry have become free-swimming a few days later, they can be offered infusoria and paramecium, moving on to baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) as they grow.",

The male immediately passes over them and releases his milt. The biggest problem with the breeding of Pygmy Puffers is that the eggs are very prone to fungussing.

The temperature of the water should be raised to 28 \u00b0C and it must be extremely well-filtered and highly oxygenated. Provide a selection of small caves which have an entrance only marginally bigger than the fish. These can either be formed from arranging the rockwork in such a way that small, secluded crevices are created, or pre-constructed from small pieces of slate siliconed together. It is crucial that these caves are situated in an area with decent water movement. When in spawning condition, males will choose a preferred cave and defend it from any other males present, whilst at the same time, will try to entice a ripe female inside. Spawning does not always take place straight away; indeed, it can be some days before the female is ready to deposit her eggs, but the fish will remain inside the cave together during this time, the male usually blocks the entrance. Once the eggs have been laid and fertilised, the male fish often has to force the female out of the cave before he begins his parental guarding duties. The female plays no further part in brood care, but the male will be seen fanning the eggs with his pectoral fins and blocking the cave entrance from any intruders. Eggs typically number around 45 and take around a week to hatch. The fry will feed from their sizeable yolk sacs for the first few days, and after this has been consumed, they will require very regular feedings of baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii), microworms, and various small or crushed dried sinking foods. It is important that food is available to the fry at all times as they can all too easily starve but keep a very close eye on water quality when feeding constantly and perform lots of very regular but very small partial changes to keep nitrogenous waste levels as low as possible. The adults pose no threat to the fry, but other fish sharing the same tank might do. This is why many aquarists like to keep these catfish in a species-only set up, to further their chances of raising the maximum number of young.",

The natural habitat should be emulated as closely as possible in the home aquarium by employing powerful filtration and using additional powerheads to create areas of decent current and to oxygenate the water efficiently. As with all botiids, these loaches must only be added to spacious aquariums that are biologically mature. Create a multitude of hiding spots and 'visual barriers' with smooth rounded rocks, cobbles, and pebbles of varying sizes, along with some driftwood and areas of robust planting. Ensure that the substrate has no sharp edges as these loaches will enjoy digging around the bottom of the tank in their search for titbits of food, and it is important that nothing damages their delicate sensory barbels. Dim lighting is preferable, and a well-covered tank is a must as these loaches are expert jumpers and can escape through the tiniest of openings.

On the western (Pacific) slope it is found in the River Guasaule in Nicaragua and on to the Tempisque and Bebedero Rivers in Costa Rica. In the 1990s, it was discovered that this species had been introduced to a hot spring at Heviz in Zala County, Hungary, where it has become firmly established. Its usual natural habitat is the weedy margins of lakes and swampy areas with muddy substrates, where it feeds on algae filaments and detritus. During dry periods, it is known to tolerate the high temperatures of small, diminishing water bodies, where it has been recorded surviving at up to 36 \u00b0C! However, this is somewhat extreme and we suggest maintaining this species at a steady temperature somewhere between 22-28 \u00b0C in the home aquarium. The tank should be a minimum of 3ft long for a pair of these fish, and larger if a group is being maintained. As these fish prefer a muddy substrate, it is best to choose sand rather than gravel for the bottom of the aquarium. Provide shelter in the form of driftwood and smooth rocky caves/pipes and flower pots, along with some areas of robust planting for additional cover. Filtration should be efficient, with a moderate amount of water flow, but do create some calmer areas using the decor. These cichlids require clean water so be sure to carry out partial water changes on a regular basis so that nitrate is kept to a minimum. Rainbow Cichlids are relatively peaceful (especially compared to other Central American cichlids) and should be kept alongside other reasonably peaceable fish such as medium sized/deep bodied tetras, medium sized barbs, robust livebearers, doradids and suckermouth catfish, and other easygoing cichlids that are of similar size. As their common name implies, Rainbow Cichlids can be very colourful fish when in good condition and are popular because of this and on account of their manageable size and calm nature. They are capable of fairly dramatic colour change, depending on their mood or when in spawning mode. This species is still regularly seen on sale under the synonym Herotilapia multispinosa.",
        "feeding": "Rainbow Cichlids are omnivorous and will accept most aquarium foods offered. Try to keep it varied with good quality carnivore and herbivore flakes, small sinking pellet foods, and a mixture of frozen foods such as white mosquito larvae, vitamin/spirulina-enriched brineshrimp, and Mysis.",
        "breeding": "Rainbow Cichlids are pair-bonded substrate spawners and are easy to breed. A pair will choose a suitable spawning site - usually a smooth rock or piece of slate - and this will be defended mostly by the male, against all other fish, particularly other male Rainbow Cichlids. The female lays her eggs on the chosen area in multiple lines, the male immediately following on each run, fertilising them. Up to 1500 eggs may be laid if the fish are large, mature adults. The female will closely guard the eggs and will fan oxygenated water over them with her pelvic fins, whilst the male defends the outside perimeter of their territory (he will sometimes take a turn in fanning the eggs). The eggs should hatch within 48 hours (temperature dependent), and the fry will become free swimming within a week. During this time, the parents may move the young into other pre-dug spawning pits within their territory. Once free swimming, the fry should be offered finely powdered fry foods and baby brineshrimp. The parents typically care for the fry for around 4 weeks, after which time the young start to go their own way.",

This is an ideal species for the spacious, mature, softwater planted aquarium. These beautiful and relatively peaceful shoaling fish should be housed in a well decorated tank that contains plenty of plants (rooted and floating) and spindly driftwood. Dried Indian Almond Leaves (Terminalia catappa) could be placed on top of the substrate to create a more natural feel, and as these gradually decompose, they will release tannins that will not only help to acidify the water, but will also bring out the best colours of the fish (these leaves will require periodic replacement). Male fish sometimes spar with one another over territory or when vying for the attentions of the females, but no real harm should ensue; the displays are very eye-catching as the colours of the male fish intensify and the elongated fins are spread wide. However, this behaviour could become problematic in smaller quarters, so it is advisable to give these fish adequate space, despite the small adult size. It is always best to try and outnumber males with females wherever possible, which is easiest to achieve in larger groups. This will also have the added benefit of making the fish feel more secure, and will result in a more effective, natural looking shoal. Tankmates could include other species of similar size and temperament e.g. other small peaceable tetras, Corydoras catfish, pencilfish, hatchetfish, dwarf cichlids such as Apistogramma or Mikrogeophagus spp., and some of the dwarf Loricariids. Avoid any slow, long-finned species. May also be seen on sale as Rainbow Tetra.",

Be sure to provide the fish with plenty of hiding places (rocks, bogwood, robust planting) and a decent current from additional powerheads. The higher the temperature of the water, the greater the level of oxygenation that is required. Rainbow Shiners are primarily a mid to top dwelling species, and they would mix well with other fish of similar size and temperament and which enjoy the same fast-flowing conditions.

        "care": "The colourful Rainbow Snakehead is endemic to the beels and swamps of the Brahmaputra River basin, north-eastern India. Here these elongate predators hibernate in mud holes during the winter and emerge into the fresh flood waters during the rainy season. Due to its ability to breathe atmospheric air, it can cope with spells of hypoxic conditions.\nThe aquarium should be spacious with plenty of hiding places amongst driftwood, rocky caves, and areas of dense planting. Provide an abundance of surface cover in the form of floating plant species to help diffuse the light. Filtration should be efficient with areas of moderate water movement and quieter resting areas out of the current, and frequent partial water changes are important to help keep nitrate to a minimum. It is essential that the aquarium has a tight fitting lid as these fishes are expert jumpers, and a small gap must be left between the surface of the water and the coverslides in order for the fish to come up and take in humid air. Using a tall aquarium with a low water level planted in a paludarium style, greatly reduces the likelihood of jumping, as well as providing plenty of surface cover and natural control of dissolved wastes. Snakeheads are obligate air breathers, which means they must have access to atmospheric air or they will drown. Contrary to reputation, this is a relatively peaceable fish, but can still be somewhat quarrelsome over territories. In particularly spacious quarters with ample visual barriers, the Rainbow Snakehead may be kept in groups. However, do observe carefully and be prepared to move fish to another aquarium if squabbles becomes too much or if two fish pair up. These fish are best maintained in a species-only aquarium, if tankmates are desired, they must be able to tolerate the seasonally low winter temperatures required as this species needs a seasonal change in temperature and maintenance to emulate the wet and dry months. During the winter period that coincides with the dry season, the fishes' metabolism will slow down and they will not show much interest in food. The water level can be dropped, the day length should be shortened and the reduction in waste levels means that water changes can be dramatically reduced. Successful set ups really do echo the swamps that these fish call home. These annual rest periods seem to be imperative for long-term health, vitality, and breeding potential.",
        "feeding": "To ensure nutritional deficiencies are avoided, a quality dried food should be used as a staple and overfeeding should be avoided. Small live or frozen foods are eagerly accepted e.g. bloodworm, white mosquito larvae, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp etc. Live invertebrates are usually a firm favourite such as appropriately-sized earthworms, crickets, cockroaches and mealworms - these can be boosted by gutloading prior to being offered.",
        "breeding": "Rainbow Snakeheads are monogamous spawners and have been bred in the home aquarium. The fish come together in an embrace similar to that of many anabantids. The eggs are buoyant and float to the surface of the water, where they are then placed into a raft structure.

        "care": "The Ranchu is a selectively bred strain of goldfish, similar to the Lionhead but with a more strongly curved back. Domesticated goldfish date back to China\"\u2122s Ming dynasty and Fancy goldfish have long been popular aquarium pets, although often as a first venture into keeping an aquarium. This is a mixed blessing, as there are far better choices for small aquaria than these big, messy fishes. Given appropriate housing and care, fancy goldfish can attain a large size and easily live for more than 15-20 years. The aquarium should be spacious and ideally around 1.2 metres long to allow room for 30cm adults to be comfortable. The length and width of the tank are much more important than the height in this respect.\nFancy goldfish grow quickly so it is best to provide them with the largest aquarium that you can from the outset to provide a much safe, stable environment for them. The larger the volume of water, the more stable it will be in terms of water chemistry and temperature. During the warmer months, these fish can be kept outside in raised water features suitably filtered and protected from predators. This can be a great way to provide extra room for your pets and they\"\u2122ll benefit from the semi-natural conditions. Like any goldfish, fancies will benefit from a seasonal drop in temperature and this can be provided by either moving them indoors in late autumn, or positioning their aquarium in a room that experiences cool room temperatures during the winter. Fancy goldfish are notoriously messy fish; they are voracious eaters and continually stir up the substrate in their ongoing search for food. Such considerable amounts of waste can lead to water quality issues in smaller aquaria if not monitored very closely. Efficient filtration that can handle copius solids is essential, and weekly partial water changes are advised in order to keep nitrate to a minimum. The water should be well-oxygenated (of particular importance during warmer spells of weather) and this is easily achieved by the use of spray-bar returns from filters or the use of an air pumps. Various species of robust plants can be added to the aquarium, but these will likely require periodic replacement due to them being uprooted/eaten - something most goldfish keepers accept and allow their fish to take pleasure in. The substrate can consist of rounded fine gravel or sand, and decor can include smooth rocks and ornaments with no sharp edges. Ranchu are sociable creatures and should be kept in groups, either with their own kind or with other varieties of fancy goldfish. It is best, however, to avoid keeping the standard 'single-tailed' common goldfish alongside the fancy varieties as the common goldfish is a faster swimmer and may outcompete the fancies at feeding time. Several colour varieties of Ranchu are available, including black, blue, chocolate, red, red and white, red cap, white, yellow, and calico.",
        "feeding": "Due to their body shape, these fish need a high fibre diet and digestive problems are often the cause of buoyancy issues as transit times are compromised by convoluted digestive tracts. Goldfish also tend to swallow air in their rush to feed which also leads to problems which are best avoided by the use of sinking foods. These can be in the form of pellets, sticks or flake presented beneath the water surface. Frozen foods or live foods such as bloodworm, Mysis, and Daphnia will provide fibre and can be fed extensively to individuals displaying issues that are often categorised as Swim Bladder Disease. The opportunity to browse on aquatic plants will help to ensure gut health.",
        "breeding": "Well-conditioned fancy goldfish will often spawn in the home aquarium. Female fish will be noticeably rounder bellied when full of eggs, and the male fish will develop spawning tubercles (tiny raised bumps) on the gill plates and pectoral fins. A large, slightly cooler water change is often enough to trigger ready pairs into spawning. As the temperature slowly rises back up to its usual level, the male will pursue the female around the aquarium, but generally in a non-aggressive manner. This courtship ritual may last more than a day before spawning commences, and the colours of the fish often intensify at this time. The male fish will nudge the female into the fine-leaved plants (or spawning mops), where she will then scatter eggs which the male simultaneously fertilises. Spawning can last for a number of hours, and several thousand adhesive eggs may be scattered over the plants/spawning mop. The adults will be hungry and will start to devour as many eggs as they can find, so are best moved to another aquarium. The eggs take 4-5 days to hatch, depending on water temperature. Young fancy goldfish are often brown in colour (like their ancestors) and it can take up to a year before full colouration becomes apparent. Fancy goldfish often produce young that differ from their parents - high quality fish that show the best attributes of their breed are normally in the minority, hence the differences in price and quality between fish.",

        "care": "The Oranda is a selectively bred strain of goldfish. Domesticated goldfish date back to China's Ming dynasty and Fancy goldfish have long been popular aquarium pets, although often as a first venture into keeping an aquarium. This is a mixed blessing, as there are far better choices for small aquaria than these big, messy fishes. Given appropriate housing and care, fancy goldfish can attain a large size and easily live for more than 15-20 years. The aquarium should be spacious and ideally around 1.2 metres long to allow room for 30cm adults to be comfortable. The length and width of the tank are much more important than the height in this respect.\nFancy goldfish grow quickly so it is best to provide them with the largest aquarium that you can from the outset to provide a much safe, stable environment for them. The larger the volume of water, the more stable it will be in terms of water chemistry and temperature. During the warmer months, these fish can be kept outside in raised water features suitably filtered and protected from predators. This can be a great way to provide extra room for your pets and they'll benefit from the semi-natural conditions. Like any goldfish, Orandas will benefit from a seasonal drop in temperature and this can be provided by either moving them indoors in late autumn, or positioning their aquarium in a room that experiences cool room temperatures during the winter. Fancy goldfish are notoriously messy fish; they are voracious eaters and continually stir up the substrate in their ongoing search for food. Such considerable amounts of waste can lead to water quality issues in smaller aquaria if not monitored very closely. Efficient filtration that can handle copius solids is essential, and weekly partial water changes are advised in order to keep nitrate to a minimum. The water should be well-oxygenated (of particular importance during warmer spells of weather) and this is easily achieved by the use of spray-bar returns from filters or the use of an air pumps. Various species of robust plants can be added to the aquarium, but these will likely require periodic replacement due to them being uprooted/eaten - something most goldfish keepers accept and allow their fish to take pleasure in. The substrate can consist of rounded fine gravel or sand, and decor can include smooth rocks and ornaments with no sharp edges. Orandas are sociable creatures and should be kept in groups, either with their own kind or with other varieties of fancy goldfish. It is best, however, to avoid keeping the standard 'single-tailed' common goldfish alongside the fancy varieties as the common goldfish is a faster swimmer and may outcompete the fancies at feeding time.",
        "feeding": "Due to their body shape, these fish need a high fibre diet and digestive problems are often the cause of buoyancy issues as transit times are compromised by convoluted digestive tracts. Goldfish also tend to swallow air in their rush to feed which also leads to problems which are best avoided by the use of sinking foods. These can be in the form of pellets, sticks or flake presented beneath the water surface. Frozen foods or live foods such as bloodworm, Mysis, and Daphnia will provide fibre and can be fed extensively to individuals displaying issues that are often categorised as Swim Bladder Disease. The opportunity to browse on aquatic plants will help to ensure gut health.",
        "breeding": "Well-conditioned fancy goldfish will often spawn in the home aquarium. Female fish will be noticeably rounder bellied when full of eggs, and the male fish will develop spawning tubercles (tiny raised bumps) on the gill plates and pectoral fins. A large, slightly cooler water change is often enough to trigger ready pairs into spawning. As the temperature slowly rises back up to its usual level, the male will pursue the female around the aquarium, but generally in a non-aggressive manner. This courtship ritual may last more than a day before spawning commences, and the colours of the fish often intensify at this time. The male fish will nudge the female into the fine-leaved plants (or spawning mops), where she will then scatter eggs which the male simultaneously fertilises. Spawning can last for a number of hours, and several thousand adhesive eggs may be scattered over the plants/spawning mop. The adults will be hungry and will start to devour as many eggs as they can find, so are best moved to another aquarium. The eggs take 4-5 days to hatch, depending on water temperature. Young fancy goldfish are often brown in colour (like their ancestors) and it can take up to a year before full colouration becomes apparent. Fancy goldfish often produce young that differ from their parents - high quality fish that show the best attributes of their breed are normally in the minority, hence the differences in price and quality between fish.",

A mature, heavily planted tank would be ideal to showcase this species, as their colours intensify when settled into a well planted environment. Dark substrate and background choices, along with some spindly driftwood will also help them to settle in. Tankmates should be of similar size and temperament and enjoy the same soft, acidic conditions. R. lacrimula is distinguished from all other species of the genus by the possession of a line of very small tubercles that form a granulated 'crest' along the dorsal surface posterior to the dorsal fin, which continue along onto the upper edge of the caudal fin, in addition to a colour pattern consisting of a faint midlateral stripe ending in a longitudinally orientated teardrop-shaped blotch.

Ideally, this will be shallow but long (and well covered) with a layer of marbles as a substrate and numerous clumps of fine-leaved plants. The temperature should be set at the higher end of the preferred range, and a gentle air driven sponge filter placed on the tank. Lighting is not necessary. A well-conditioned pair should be carefully acclimatised to the breeding aquarium, and spawning can be triggered by performing a small, slightly cooler water change. Eggs will be scattered in batches amongst the plants and marbles, and most should fall to safety. Once spawning eventually appears to cease, the parent fish should be removed to avoid predation. The eggs are somewhat sensitive, but under good conditions should hatch within 24-48 hours (temperature dependent). The fry should become free-swimming a further 24-48 hours later and can be fed on infusoria, Artemia nauplii and finely crushed egg-layer first foods.",

        "care": "The Red Devil is known only from the Nicaraguan great lakes of Lago Managua and Lago Nicaragua (Lago Cocibolca) and occasionally in the slower, heavily vegetated reaches of the Tipitapa River that connects the two. This species is highly territorial and grows large, so a voluminous aquarium is required with powerful filtration to match. Provide a substrate of soft sand or small rounded gravel. Sizeable pieces of driftwood and rocks/slate can be used to create sheltered areas, but these should be made secure as these hefty cichlids are notorious diggers and they more than capable of moving d\u00c3\u00a9cor around. Bonding pieces of rock together with aquarium grade silicon sealant prior to filling the tank is sensible. As large quantities of substrate are likely to be bulldozed on a daily basis, plants cannot be cultivated. A guard should be fitted to the heater in order to protect it against breakages, or better still, opt for a canister filter that has a heater built in, so the element is not situated in the tank itself. Partial water changes should be carried out on a frequent basis to help keep nitrate to a minimum. This is an exceptionally aggressive species which is best maintained singly or as an established male-female pair. They are intolerant of their own kind, but can sometimes be combined with other robust cichlids, if the aquarium is particularly spacious (over 1000 litres) and has a plethora of visual barriers. Tankmates could include other Central/South American cichlids of a similar size and temperament, or large armoured catfish. However, if breeding does occur, expect a huge amount of aggression directed towards the other fish and be prepared to move the tankmates to another aquarium for their own safety. Sometimes the male can be very persistent when wanting to breed, and if the female is not receptive, he may harm her. So always observe carefully and have a tank divider on hand, should the need arise to separate an overly amorous male from his female. Ensure the aquarium has a tight fitting hood that is weighted down, as these heavyset fish are expert jumpers. Despite its large size and belligerent nature, this remains a popular fish with cichlid enthusiasts. Many Red Devil keepers report how these intelligent fish quickly learn to recognise their owners, likening them to \"\u02dcpet dogs\"\u2122, such are their characters and responses to visual stimuli. Several tank-bred colour varieties exist including orange, red, white, white and orange, yellow, banded, and marbled.\nSince their first importation, many related species have been discovered. Combined with supected crossings with Midas cichlids (A. citrinellus), this means that fishes without location data are often labelled as 'Middevils' to hint at their possible hybrid origin. Red devils have more a pointed snout and are generally less heavily-built.",
        "feeding": "Omnivorous. This species requires a balanced diet in order to retain good colours. Slow sinking pellets/sticks, frozen foods such as Mysis shrimp, krill, chopped cockle, chopped mussel meat and prawns will all be taken with much enthusiasm. Be sure to provide a vegetable component to the diet, such as spinach, kale, lettuce and cucumber.",
        "breeding": "This species has been bred in the home aquarium, but it can be difficult establishing a compatible pair. Simply placing a male and female together is unlikely to work and may have disastrous consequences. It is far better to obtain a group of juveniles and grow them on, letting a pair form naturally from the group. However, you would need to have a plan in place for rehoming the remaining fish. Even then, if the female is not receptive, the male may end up killing her, so always have a tank divider on hand should things get violent. When ready to spawn, the nuchal hump on both the male and female will increase in size and their colours will intensify. The courtship dance is a vigorous affair, with much mouthing and tail slapping. Again, have the tank divider handy in case things get a bit out of control. Eggs are usually deposited on a vertical piece of slate, a flat piece of driftwood, or in a rocky cave. Up to 700 eggs will be laid/fertilised, and these can be expected to hatch within 72 hours. The parents will then move the wrigglers to a pre-dug pit. They will become free-swimming after a further few days when their yolk sacs are used up, and can be offered baby brineshrimp or crushed flake. At this point, it would be wise to separate the male from the female using the tank divider, as the male will be hyper-aggressive in defence of the fry. If carrying out maintenance on the tank, he is quite likely to attack your hands, so be very careful. Parental care usually continues for around 6 weeks. Please be aware that a bonded pair may reproduce on a regular basis, and always in exceptionally large numbers. Therefore, it is important to consider whether you should really allow this species to reproduce in the home aquarium, and should have a homing plan in place for the potentially hundreds, if not thousands, of juvenile fish (that are going to attain a substantial size), which are going to quickly overwhelm an aquarium. Once the fry have been removed from the aquarium, observe the adults carefully as the male may attempt to spawn again immediately, and the female may not be ready.",

The easiest way to do this is to submerge a small container into the tank and place the egg-laden mop in it and remove. The mop can then be replaced by a new one and the egg-laden mop placed into the hatching tank (which must have matching water parameters). The eggs are approx 1mm in diameter and are translucent. After 5-7 days, it is wise to intervene in the spawning process so the females do not become exhausted. Carefully catch the fish out and acclimatise them back to the main aquarium, where they can rest and be bought back into condition with nutritious feedings. The hatching aquarium should be set up with a small airstone, and the eggs within the mops can be expected to hatch within 3 days or so, by which time they will appear more pigmented. Once free-swimming (usually after a week), the fry may be offered infusoria, moving on to larger foodstuffs e.g. finely powdered fry foods and nauplii in accordance with their growth. Snails (from a disease free source) can be added to the tank to help clear up any excess food, and any that is missed should be siphoned out during the daily partial water change regime which must be carried out carefully and slowly.",

D\u00c3\u00a9cor such as ocean rock can be used to build sturdy structures which stretch from the base of the tank to near the surface of the water. These structures should be built with the purpose of creating many crevices for the fish to explore but constructed in such a way so as to keep the rocks stable if the fish start to dig around and underneath them. Although a substrate of coral sand or Aragonite is often recommended to help to keep the water hard and alkaline, these fish feel safer and show better colours over a darker substrate. The Aragonite or coral sand can always be placed into a mesh bag and kept inside the external filter for buffering purposes. The Red Empress Hap is solitary in nature and can be kept singly in the aquarium, or one male with a harem of several females. Tankmates must be chosen with care as smaller fish will be eaten. Suitable companions could include other large rift lake species such as Dimidiochromis compressiceps, Fossorochromis rostratus, sizeable Haplochromis/Nimbochromis species, large Synodontis catfish etc. There are several geographical colour morphs available, such as Boadzulu Island, Chilumba Jetty, Chinyamwezi Island, Chizumulu Island, Karonga, Likoma Island (Tangerine Tiger), Magunga, Makanjila (Blue Fire), and Namalenje Island (Firecracker) as well as a tank bred ultra red strain known as Super Red Empress.

This is a similar-looking species to the Red Tailed Red Eyed Puffer (Carinotetraodon irrubesco) but it attains a slightly larger adult size, and is altogether a rather more belligerent and territorial fish. It can, however, be kept in pairs (one male, one female) provided that the aquarium is of a good size and is well-furnished with a large number of visual barriers in the form of rocky caves, driftwood, and areas of dense planting. These puffers are best kept in a species-only situation as they will behave aggressively towards other species, and despite their relatively diminutive size, will bite at the fins and bodies of other fish, inflicting serious damage. They are also aggressive towards their own kind, which is why it is best to keep these fish singly or as a compatible pair only. Red Eyed Puffers are capable of fairly dramatic colour change, depending on their surroundings or mood. Males and females can also look so different to one another, that in the past, they have been mistaken for totally different species. Efficient filtration and frequent partial water changes are a must for these puffers, but do ensure that water movement is gentle. Also known as the Red Bellied Puffer.",

The water should be very soft and acidic, with the temperature set to the high end of the preferred range. The male will swim around the female in a lengthy and vigorous courtship ritual with his dorsal and ventral ridges erect. The eggs are released by the female over a pre-determined site (such as a clump of Java moss) and the male simultaneously fertilises them. The male takes on the brood care, chasing away the female before commencing to fan the mildly adhesive eggs with his pectoral fins. The eggs can be expected to hatch within 36-48 hours, and after a further 48 hours will become free-swimming. The parents will predate upon the fry at this stage, so they must be separated. Feeding the tiny youngsters can be especially difficult; even newly hatched brineshrimp is too large for them, so other miniscule foods such as Cyclops nauplii must be sourced beforehand.",

        "care": "Like other hillstream loach species, the Red Gecko Loach does have specialist care requirements. These striking \"suckerbelly\" loaches have evolved to live in extremely fast-flowing waters, where they use their pectoral and pelvic fins to form a \"suction cup\" in order to hang on to smooth rocks amongst rapids. This high-velocity habitat must be replicated in the home aquarium by use of extra powerheads (in addition to the return flow from filters) to create a river type effect. The surface of the water should be visibly moving to ensure that there is a very high amount of oxygenation within the water at all times. An additional air-pump is also a handy back-up. Without such a high level of oxygenation and water movement, Red Gecko Loaches will not fare well at all. These delicate fish should only be added to aquariums that are well mature. Such tanks will have a good established growth of algae for the fish to graze upon in order to consume the micro-organisms within, and will provide a source of nourishment whilst the fish may be adapting to the taking of prepared foods. The front glass can be wiped free of algae, but it is recommended that you allow algae to freely colonise the sides and back glass, and over the decor. Lighting should be bright in order to encourage a decent amount of algal growth. Ideally, the aquarium will be at least 36\" long, and contain a multitude of hiding spots amongst rocks, cobbles and bogwood. Flat smooth rocks should be placed in the path of the flow, where these fish will often congregate just as they would do in their natural boulder-strewn habitats. Plants can be incorporated into the river style aquarium, but not all species will fare well under the extreme flow conditions. Having said this, many aquarists have had a good deal of success with Anubias species and Java fern (Microsorum sp.) tied to driftwood, and also some species of Cryptocoryne such as C. balansae. Plants are not found in great abundance in the natural habitat of the Red Gecko Loach, so are not considered essential, but they will help with water quality and will make the aquarium look more aesthetically pleasing. Indeed, many aquarists have observed their loaches resting on the tips of broad leaved plants, \"surfing\" in the current with obvious enjoyment. These extraordinary fish deserve a specialist aquarium to meet their needs. Their quirky behaviour is something totally out of the ordinary and is a real joy to observe. Aquarists often report that these peaceful loaches, once acclimatised to a eating a captive diet, will launch themselves into a feeding frenzy when they get the merest scent of food entering the aquarium. This may unnerve some tiny skittish species, but on the whole, they will mix well with numerous peaceful current-loving fish such as White Cloud Mountain Minnows and many species from the Danio family, plus other similar hillstream loach species. Red Gecko Loaches can be very sensitive to the shipping process, so be sure that your dealer rests them after import and whilst doing so, keeps them in suitable highly oxygenated conditions. The Red Gecko Loach \"\u201c Homaloptera confuzona \"\u201c belongs in the \"Orthogoniata complex\" which contains several very similar-looking species such as H. ogilviei, H. bilineata, H. parclitella, and H. orthogoniata. There can be a wide variation in pattern in several of these species, which makes identification very tricky. Experts can differentiate the various species by examining clear hi-resolution photographs of the fish, each member of this complex having scale keels of different shapes and sizes. May also be seen on sale as Red Lizard Loach.",

        "care": "In the captivating world of aquatics, tropical fish do not come much more controversial than the Red Parrot Cichlid. This man-made hybrid is quite the 'Marmite fish' - people tend to either love 'em or hate 'em. The parentage of these bright orange fish has always been something of a closely guarded secret, but when they were first glimpsed during the 1980s, there was much speculation that they were a cross between the Severum (Heros severus) and the Red Devil (Amphilophus labiatus). Both of those species were, at the time, classified in Cichlasoma, so at that time a hybridisation between two fish of the same genus was, perhaps, not all that surprising. But both fish were later reclassified into separate genera, which made the breeding then somewhat unexpected and a little contentious. Since then, other parent species have been suggested, such as a cross between the Midas Cichlid (Amphilophus citrinellus) and the Redheaded Cichlid (Vieja synspila); yet others feel the Convict Cichlid (Amatitlania nigrofasciata) is involved somewhere along the lines. Whatever the parentage, and love them or hate them, it seems that these fish are here to stay in the fishkeeping hobby. Red Parrot Cichlids have a roundish shaped body that is somewhat unnatural and akin to some of the balloon mutations bred in various other fish in recent years. It is thought that these hybrid fish have been further line bred for this mutation (as a straightforward hybrid will not necessarily result in deformed spines every time), and this has also resulted in large eyes and a very small mouth that resembles a parrot's beak. The mouth is usually unable to fully close, giving the fish a slightly comical, smiling appearance. They are usually an all-over solid orange-red colour, but calico or paler variants are sometimes available. Sadly, these fish are often artificially coloured via dying or tattooing, and these specimens should be avoided at all costs so as not to perpetuate such cruel practices. Despite all the mystery and controversy surrounding the Red Parrot Cichlid, it still remains a popular aquarium fish, and is fairly straightforward to care for. As these fish can attain quite a modest size, a spacious aquarium is requisite, along with sturdy decor that can stand up to the rigours of these inquisitive diggers. Adults will require a tank measuring 6ft x 2ft x 2ft to really be able to thrive. Ideally driftwood and rocks should be placed on the base of the aquarium before adding substrate, so that the fish cannot undermine the structures. Plants will be uprooted and eaten, so it is best to stick to robust artificial vegetation in the Red Parrot aquarium, and ensure it is well secured. Provide plenty of hiding places and interesting areas for the fish to explore, as well as an open swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Filtration should be efficient, ideally an external canister, as these fish are messy eaters and can produce a fair amount of waste. Although Red Parrots are known to be extremely hardy and tolerant of less-than-ideal water conditions, this should not be an excuse to let things slip - they will always be at their best in clean, well filtered water with a moderate level of oxygenation. Red Parrot Cichlids can vary in temperament, but on the whole, most are fairly easy-going with each other and with different species. However, do observe very carefully as 'rogue' specimens have been known (and it is worth remembering here that one or more of the parent fish are considered aggressive, so it would seem that such traits sometimes come through). Tankmates should be peaceful and large enough not to be eaten (avoid Neon Tetra sized fish as these would be considered a snack). Ideal companions could include gouramis, large rainbowfish, barbs, larger deep-bodied tetras, Severums, Firemouths, and some of the Acara or Geophagus spp. Do bear in mind though, that Red Parrots are relatively slow moving fish and can easily be outcompeted for food by faster swimming tankmates - and sometimes their misshapen mouths do not help when competing for food either. Whatever your view on the Red Parrot Cichlid, they are intelligent, curious fish that, over time, can become tame and recognise their owner in the same endearing way that Oscars do. If they appeal to you and you can provide them with the space and conditions that they enjoy, you will be rewarded with happy, hand-tame, pet fish.\nThey are usually an all-over solid orange-red colour, but calico or paler variants are sometimes available. Natural colours should mirror those seen in the wild species that make up this hybrid - these fish are often artificially coloured via dying or even tattooing, and these specimens should be avoided at all costs so as not to perpetuate such cruel practices. May also be seen on sale as Blood Parrot Cichlids.",
        "feeding": "Omnivorous. Offer a variety of foods including cichlid pellets (there are pellets available that are specifically formulated for Blood Parrot Cichlids), flake, vegetable matter, and frozen foods such as Mysis shrimp, chopped krill, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, mosquito larvae etc. Observe your fish carefully at feeding times to ensure that they are not being out-competed by faster fish. Foods rich in carotenoids will help the fish to maintain their bright orange-red colours.",
        "breeding": "For a long time, it was believed that Red Parrot Cichlids were completely sterile. Yet as the years have passed, more and more aquarists have reported spawning behaviour /egg laying from their Red Parrots. For the most part, the eggs have not been viable, but recently there have been claims of successful spawnings with fry being raised to adulthood, although any hard proof of this seems a little hard to come by. There is speculation that the fish have somehow become less sterile as some of the early severe mutations (such as reduced gill covers) have been bred out. Mature females have also been known to cross breed with non-hybrid cichlids, such as Convicts. Regardless of why this is now allegedly occurring, the spawning behaviour of Red Parrot Cichlids is similar to that of most other cichlids: the pair will choose a preferred spawning site (usually a flat rock, but sometimes a cave or the aquarium glass) and clean this area prior to eggs being laid. The parent fish will become very aggressive and will fiercely guard the clutch, chasing off any intruders that get too close. In most cases the eggs will fungus over in a few days, and they will be abandoned (or eaten). Should they actually hatch, the fry will stick close to the parents, who will guard them until they are around 2.5cm in length.",

Lake Sentani in Northern Papua is around 17 miles long and 12 miles wide, with rainbows favouring the shoreline shallows, especially as youngsters. This species shows a clear preference for habitats rich in aquatic plants and overhanging vegetation, with peak activity in the cooler parts of the day. Males are more likely to be found in the shallows, with females spending more time in deeper water.\nThis is a peaceful shoaling species ideally suited to the planted community aquarium. They should be kept in groups of 6 or more individuals and because of their active nature and large adult size, the aquarium should be at least 4ft long to allow them a good amount of swimming space. As with many other Rainbowfish species, the small juveniles can look comparatively drab to the absolutely stunning adult fish, and so are all too often overlooked in the shops. However, once settled into the security of the planted aquarium, these young specimens will soon begin to colour up, revealing their true adult beauty. The males in particular will develop a positively dazzling appearance, with the dominant male displaying the brightest colours of all. Intensity of males can vary, with higher temperatures often leading to a deeper burgundy hue.\n Despite their large and deep-bodied adult size, Red Rainbowfish will not bother smaller tankmates as their mouths/throats are too narrow to be able to swallow them. Although currently abundant in their wild habitat, this species is listed as 'vulnerable' on the IUCN redlist of endangered species due to its limited distribution. Red Rainbowfish are one of the most popular aquarium rainbowfishes and are commercially bred on a large scale, so the specimens you see in the shops will be tank-raised and many generations away from their wild ancestors.

A conditioned pair should then be acclimatised across to the breeding aquarium, which should be furnished with plenty of fine-leaved plants/Java moss clumps. After a time, the male will begin displaying to the female. He will then begin to drive the female over the plants, utilising the whole length of the tank. The eggs will be scattered over the plants a few at a time. These fish are known as 'continual spawners' which means that the spawning activity takes place over several days, even months in some cases. This can present problems to the aquarist in that some adult fish may begin to consume the eggs as they are scattered. Alternatively, a spawning mop or clump of moss can be added to the main tank and moved to a rearing set up - note that this approach is inadvisable when housing different species together due to the very real danger of hybridisation. Many fishkeepers have found the eggs to be remarkably tough and have had great success in siphoning them out into another aquarium (containing matching water from the spawning tank). The eggs will usually hatch in 6-9 days (dependent on temperature) and once free-swimming, the tiny fry can be offered infusoria, moving onto larger foodstuffs such as baby brineshrimp and fine crushed flake foods as they develop.",

Capable of adapting to a range of conditions, Red Robin Gouramis will be seen at their best in softwater aquaria, where their colouration will be maximised if fed a diet rich in colour-enhancing pigments. They should never be kept alongside fin-nipping species as the trailing thread-like pelvic fins will prove too much of a temptation. A lot of debate surrounds the mysterious origins of this aquarium colour strain, and it has not been confirmed whether it was created by hybridisation. It seems to be an intensively colour-fed Orange thick lipped gourami and batches seem dominated by males. To add to the confusion, this fish may also be seen on sale as Red 'Honey' Gourami.",

They should then be moved to a shallow planted breeding tank (include floating species) filtered by a small air-driven sponge filter which will give a minimal flow rate and pose no risk of breaking up the bubblenest when constructed by the male. Spawning will occur beneath the bubblenest, with the male wrapping his body around the females in an embrace with much shaking. Up to 600 eggs will be released/fertilised, and these will float up into the bubblenest. Any that stray wide will be herded into the safety of the nest by the male. The male does become quite aggressive at this point as he begins guarding his nest, and the female should be carefully netted out and acclimatised back to the main aquarium. The eggs should begin to hatch after 24-36 hours, at which time the male should also be removed. The fry are tiny and usually start to become free swimming after a further 48 hours and will need to be offered appropriately sized first foods such as infusoria. After a couple of weeks, they can be moved onto finely powdered dry foods and baby brineshrimp. It is of extreme importance to maintain a warm layer of air between the surface of the water and the coverslides at all times whilst the fry are developing their labyrinth organ, critical during the first few weeks of their life.",

For best results use a trusted synthetic marine sea salt and a hydrometer or refractometer to monitor the conditions. The aquarium itself must be of spacious dimensions for these fast swimmers, and although juveniles can be started off in a 4ft long tank, adult fish are going to require a tank measuring at least 6ft x 2ft x 2ft. Red Scats are a naturally shoaling species and can be semi-aggressive towards each other. It is best to keep a group of at least 6 specimens to ensure a natural sized group, and this usually also has the desired effect of no one single fish bearing the continuous brunt of any aggressive behaviour. The entire group should be introduced at the same time (monitor the water quality carefully) as newcomers are often not accepted. The tank should be aquascaped to include some shadier areas amongst large bogwood pieces and slate stood up at the back of the aquarium, along with resin \"root\" ornaments. If plants are desired, it is best to use plastic or silk examples, as most things green and leafy are regarded as a snack. A decent amount of filtration should be employed and areas of fast water movement created in the aquarium via additional powerheads. This will also help to keep oxygen levels high. Sensitive to pollutants, the aquarium water should be kept in excellent condition at all times with frequent partial water changes. Take care when carrying out maintenance on the aquarium or when transferring these fish to a new tank as they are said to possess mildly poisonous dorsal spines. Archer fish, Monodactylus and other scats make great companions. Be sure to cover the tank well as all these fish are expert jumpers.

It belongs to the Peacock group of cichlids and is found in the intermediate zone, where rocky shores give way to wide expanses of sand. Unusually, it shows a preference for rocky caves, which is in contrast to many other Aulonocara species that prefer an open expanse of sand in which they can forage for sand-dwelling invertebrates. The aquarium should be at least 4ft long and aquascaped with open expanses of sand in addition to a number of rocky areas including caves. D\u00c3\u00a9cor such as ocean rock can be used to build sturdy structures which stretch from the base of the tank to near the surface of the water. These structures should be built with the purpose of creating many crevices for the fish to explore but constructed in such a way so as to keep the rocks stable if the fish start to dig around and underneath them. Although a substrate of coral sand or Aragonite is often recommended to help to keep the water hard and alkaline, Peacocks feel safer and show better colours over a darker substrate. The Aragonite or coral sand can always be placed into a mesh bag and kept inside the external filter for buffering purposes. This is a relatively peaceful species (as far as Malawi cichlids are concerned), however, whilst it may be tempting to add more of the colourful males than females to your setup, this is unnatural for a Peacock colony and will result in territorial disputes and stress. The ideal combination would be one or two males with a larger group (5+) of females. This species can be kept successfully alongside midwater Haps such as Copadichromis, Cyrtocara, Placidochromis etc and some of the more easygoing Mbuna (such as Labidochromis caeruleus).

The tank should be mature, water movement gentle, and the tank furnished with driftwood and plenty of plant life (including floating species and species which form large broad leaves near the water's surface). Peat filtration would be very beneficial.

As a shoaling species, Red Spotted Splash Tetras are best maintained in good sized groups; six specimens at the minimum and 10+ being much better.

When ready to breed, the male will search for a suitable spawning territory and then attempt to entice a ripe female into the area. The eggs will be laid on broad leaved plants near the surface or scattered amongst finer-leaved vegetation. Once she appears spent of eggs, it is wise to remove the female from the breeding aquarium, as the male fish takes on sole responsibility of guarding the eggs until they hatch (usually between 36-72 hours depending on water temperature). Once the eggs begin to hatch, all paternal care ceases, and the male should also be removed from the aquarium to prevent predation. The fry will begin feeding after 2 days, once their yolk sacs have been absorbed. Offer them infusoria, brineshrimp nauplii, and microworms. Growth is generally very slow. In very heavily planted aquaria, a good number of the fry should survive to adulthood without intervention.",

Here it is found in various biotopes, including small-medium sized rivers, where it tends to favour the slower, heavily vegetated reaches close to the margins. This species is highly territorial and grows very large (length and girth), so a voluminous aquarium is required with powerful filtration to match. Provide a substrate of soft sand or small rounded gravel. Sizeable pieces of driftwood and rocks/slate can be used to create sheltered areas, but these should be made secure as these hefty cichlids are notorious diggers and they more than capable of moving d\u00c3\u00a9cor around. Bonding pieces of rock together with aquarium grade silicon sealant prior to filling the tank is sensible. As large quantities of substrate are likely to be bulldozed on a daily basis, plants cannot be cultivated. A guard should be fitted to the heater in order to protect it against breakages, or better still, opt for a canister filter that has a heater built in, so the element is not situated in the tank itself. Partial water changes should be carried out on a frequent basis to help keep nitrate to a minimum. This is an exceptionally aggressive species which is best maintained singly or as an established male-female pair. They are intolerant of their own kind, but can sometimes be combined with other robust cichlids, if the aquarium is particularly spacious (over 1000 litres) and has a plethora of visual barriers. Tankmates could include other Central/South American cichlids of a similar size and temperament, or large armoured catfish. However, if breeding does occur, expect a huge amount of aggression directed towards the other fish and be prepared to move the tankmates to another aquarium for their own safety. Sometimes the male can be very persistent when wanting to breed, and if the female is not receptive, he may harm her. So always observe carefully and have a tank divider on hand, should the need arise to separate an overly amorous male from his female. Ensure the aquarium has a tight fitting hood that is weighted down, as these heavyset fish are expert jumpers. Despite its large size and belligerent nature, this remains a popular fish with cichlid enthusiasts. Sexual dichromatism becomes apparent when the fish reach 10-12.5cm (4-5\").",
        "feeding": "Omnivorous. This species requires a balanced diet in order to retain good colours. Slow sinking pellets/sticks, frozen foods such as Mysis shrimp, krill, chopped cockle, chopped mussel meat and prawns will all be taken with much enthusiasm. Be sure to provide a vegetable component to the diet, such as spinach, kale, lettuce and cucumber.",
        "breeding": "This species has been bred in the home aquarium, but it can be difficult establishing a compatible pair. Simply placing a male and female together is unlikely to work and may have disastrous consequences. It is far better to obtain a group of juveniles and grow them on, letting a pair form naturally from the group. However, you would need to have a plan in place for rehoming the remaining fish. Even then, if the female is not receptive, the male may end up killing her, so always have a tank divider on hand should things get violent. When ready to spawn, the colour of the fish will intensify. The courtship dance is a vigorous affair, with much mouthing and tail slapping. Again, have the tank divider handy in case things get a bit out of control. Eggs are usually deposited on a vertical piece of slate, a flat piece of driftwood, or in a rocky cave. Up to 3000 eggs will be laid/fertilised, and these can be expected to hatch within 72 hours. The parents will then move the wrigglers to a pre-dug pit. They will become free-swimming after a further few days when their yolk sacs are used up, and can be offered baby brineshrimp or crushed flake. At this point, it would be wise to separate the male from the female using the tank divider, as the male will be hyper-aggressive in defence of the fry. If carrying out maintenance on the tank, he is quite likely to attack your hands, so be very careful. Parental care usually continues for around 6 weeks. Please be aware that a bonded pair may reproduce on a regular basis, and always in exceptionally large numbers. Therefore, it is important to consider whether you should really allow this species to reproduce in the home aquarium, and should have a homing plan in place for the potentially hundreds, if not thousands, of juvenile fish (that are going to attain a substantial size), which are going to quickly overwhelm an aquarium. Once the fry have been removed from the aquarium, observe the adults carefully as the male may attempt to spawn again immediately, and the female may not be ready.",

        "care": "The Red-bellied Piranha has a wide area of natural distribution, throughout much of the Amazon and Paraguay-Parana River basins, and is also known from coastal rivers in north-eastern Brazil, the Essequibo River basin, and the Rio Uruguay. Here, it may be found in a variety of different habitats, including main river channels and smaller tributaries, floodplain lakes, creeks, and interconnected ponds. The aquarium must be exceptionally voluminous, with oversized filtration to match, as these fish attain a large size and produce a lot of waste. Juveniles grow quickly, so a spacious aquarium is required from the outset. The fearsome man-eating reputation is a falsehood that has been hugely over-exaggerated and perpetuated over the years, with various unsubstantiated anecdotes being spread, horror films being made, and public aquaria displaying the so-called bloodthirsty fish alongside plastic skeletons, inferring a 'stripped to the bone' effect. To date, there is not a single genuine report of any human being having been killed by piranha. The legend has perhaps come about from sightings of when the fish have become trapped in pools during the dry season, and have had to feed on the other fish in the ever receding waters in order to stay alive. This may appear quite frenzied in the shallow waters. They have been known to attack obviously sick or dying fish though, and will scavenge on animal carcasses that they come across, but there is no evidence to support these fish ganging up on otherwise healthy animals that enter the water. Indeed, they rarely exhibit group hunting behaviour, generally preferring to hunt alone, ambushing smaller fish in heavily vegetated areas. In reality, this species can be somewhat nervous in the aquarium and is best kept in groups of 5 or more of its own kind. Some aquarists prefer to maintain piranha in a bare-bottomed arrangement for ease of maintenance, but they will be much less skittish if kept over gravel or sand. Decor is really down to personal choice, but hefty chunks of bogwood and some large rocky caves will be appreciated. Plants, even robust species, are likely to be eaten - so if vegetation is desired, it may be better to opt for plastic or silk varieties. As mentioned above, Red-bellied Piranha are messy eaters that produce a lot of waste, and require excellent water conditions at all times. To this end, filtration must be powerful and the water well-oxygenated. Frequent partial water changes are essential as these fish will not tolerate an elevated nitrate level. Canister filters can be employed, but sump filtration may be better as then equipment such as heaters can be kept in the sump and out of the main tank where they could be easily damaged. Red-bellied Piranha are best maintained in a species-only set-up, as within the confines of the aquarium, other fish will be at risk as they do form part of the natural diet and won't be able to escape as they would in the wild. Juvenile piranha exhibit fairly marked schooling behaviour, whereas the adults tend to form looser aggregations with a complex social hierarchy. A good sized group is essential for their long-term wellbeing, with all individuals needing to be of similar size and introduced simultaneously. Do take care when carrying out routine maintenance on the aquarium, as although accidental bites are unlikely, they are possible if the fish feels threatened/defensive - and they possess powerful dentition.",
        "feeding": "Omnivorous, but with a preference for meaty foods. Smaller specimens can be offered bloodworm, white mosquito larvae, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, Mysis shrimp etc, and larger specimens will enjoy krill, prawns, mussel meat, cockle meat, lancefish, pieces of white fish flesh etc. Some occasional vegetable matter will also be taken.",
        "breeding": "The Red-bellied Piranha has been bred in the home aquarium. Where a group of well-conditioned, mature fish are present, spawning may be initiated by performing a large, slightly cooler water change. Male fish will become territorial and create a pit in the substrate, often near to roots or vegetation, and this is then vigorously defended. If a female is receptive, there will be a short circular courtship dance, with both male and female displaying heightened colouration before eggs and milt are released in several batches within the pit, often on plant roots. The eggs are subsequently guarded by the male and should hatch within 48-72 hours (temperature dependent) with the fry becoming free-swimming just a few days later. In order to raise a good number of young, it is prudent at this point to siphon them into smaller growing-on tanks with matching water parameters and gentle air-driven sponge filters. The fry will require very regular feedings with baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and microworm, and this means that small regular water changes are needed on a frequent basis. Unfortunately, the fry can become cannibalistic as they grow, so be sure to observe carefully and move similar sized fry in together, so that their smaller siblings are not eaten by much larger individuals. These fish always reproduce in large numbers. Therefore, if taking on such a breeding project, it is important to have a homing plan in place for (potentially) hundreds, if not thousands, of juvenile fish - as they can quickly overwhelm an aquarium.",

Unless breeding, Krobia are generally peaceful, and don't tend to bother any tankmates too large to swallow. Wild fish are found in loose aggregations and keeping a small group will generally keep them busy with one another, as well as allowing them to select their own partner at spawning time.

Red-clawed Crabs require a paludarium or an aquarium that has a dropped water level with decor extending above the water line. These crabs are not fully aquatic, and absolutely MUST have an area where they can climb free of the water. The land area should be sandy with plenty of roots and rocky caves (which make excellent hiding places when the crabs are moulting), and the water area should be heated and filtered as normal.

Regular partial water changes should be carried out on the water area as you would do in an aquarium.

The substrate should consist of aquatic sand or fine, rounded gravel; this is because although the Red-clawed Crayfish is classed as non-burrowing, it will wallow and excavate small amounts of substrate until its favoured shelter is enlarged in a layout that is acceptable. The tank should be furnished with several shady caves (these could be fashioned from rocks, driftwood, bamboo or PVC tubes, coconut shells etc), with cobbles and pebbles added to the surroundings to create a stream bed effect. Unfortunately, most plants will be uprooted, shredded, and eaten, so are best omitted from the aquascape. Filtration should be efficient with moderate water movement and oxygenation. Partial water changes should be carried out on a frequent basis to avoid the build up of nitrate. Every so often as it grows, the crayfish will shed its exoskeleton - this should be left in the aquarium for the crayfish to consume for much needed calcium.

It is a nocturnal species which prefers dim lighting and plenty of hiding places/natural territories in the form of rocky caves, bogwood pieces and robust plants. Despite their obvious beauty and appeal, Red-finned Blue Loaches are actually quite belligerent and are not suited to community aquaria. As a shoaling species, these loaches, with their highly complex social structures, must be kept in groups of 5 or more. A smaller group will result in aggression-related problems, and the keeping of a single specimen to suppress this behaviour is not only unnatural and causes the fish to become reclusive, but from a social-needs point of view, it is incredibly cruel. To see these fish at their best, be sure to keep them in the large sized shoals they are accustomed to. Scuffles will inevitably break out from time to time (usually over pecking order or food) but as with a larger shoal, any aggression will be spread out with no one fish continually bearing the brunt. Blue moon lighting, timed to come on just before the main tank lights go off of an evening, is highly beneficial and will allow you to view the antics of this species under subdued conditions when they will feel most confident. As with all botiid loaches, they will appreciate well-filtered, clean water with high levels of flow and oxygenation. Partial water changes should be carried out on a frequent basis in order to prevent the build up of nitrates. The substrate should consist of a soft sand or fine rounded gravel in order to protect the delicate sensory barbel area of these inquisitive fish.

Its inclusion here is for information purposes only, as there will be very few aquarists capable of housing these fish in a suitable set up long-term. They are best left to public aquaria or, better still, left to the tropical rivers, streams and lakes which they inhabit in the wild. Juvenile fish grow very quickly, so a good sized tank will be needed from the outset. Bear in mind that adult fish will need a tank of mammoth proportions for these fast, powerful swimmers. It is often commented that Red Finned Cigar Sharks are skittish, but this is normally because they are being confined in far too small an aquarium and just do not have the space to swim at speed before reaching the sides of the tank, and also because they are often maintained in too small a group and become nervous. If appropriately sized housing can be provided, this vast aquarium will require oversized filtration, fast water movement provided by XL powerheads, and a high level of oxygenation. These fish are voracious eaters and do not tolerate accumulated nitrates very well, which can all so easily escalate in a tank with fish of such large body mass and huge appetites. Frequent partial water changes are a must. The tank can be furnished with some big pieces of driftwood and rocks, but a large open swimming space must be left along the front of the tank. Red Finned Cigar Sharks are a shoaling species and must be maintained in groups of at least 6 specimens, and preferably more. An aquarium to properly house these fish long-term represents quite a commitment in terms of money, time, and space. This species has been misidentified in the trade as L. hoevenii for many years.",

        "care": "The Red-lined Fairy Cichlid is known from the shallow, precipitous rocky habitat at Lunangwa Bay, south-western Lake Tanganyika. Here, these elegant fish form large shoals (hundreds of fish) which forage for food together, although when of breeding age, they form monogamous pairs.\nThe aquarium that houses this species should be at least 4ft long, with a good amount of filtration, water movement and oxygenation. The best choice of substrate would be coral sand or aragonite, which will help to keep the water hard and alkaline. Rocks should be used to create small outcrops and plenty of caves, ensuring that there are ample visual barriers. Red-lined Fairy Cichlids can be somewhat aggressive towards one another in the confines of the home aquarium, so broken lines of sight amongst the decor will help. These cichlids can be maintained in a species-only aquarium or as part of a Tanganyikan community with robust fish of similar size and temperament. However, if a breeding pair forms within the group, they can become much more territorially aggressive, and it is often best to move them to a tank of their own at this stage. Combining Red-lined Fairy Cichlids with other species does not always work in the long run, as their breeding strategy of producing large numbers with generations of juveniles defending their burgeoning family and ever-growing home territory, will eventually leave no room for outsiders. Red-lined Fairy Cichlids are intolerant of poor water conditions, so ensure small partial water changes are carried out on a frequent basis.\nThis species is currently considered to be a form of N. pulcher can be told apart from others in the closely related 'brichardi complex' by the presence of two curved dark markings on each gill cover and lines along the flanks. As they readily hybridise, these different forms should never be housed together.",

        "breeding": "Neolamprologus are cave spawning species. The bond these fish form when breeding is strong and is retained during brood care and subsequent spawns. In the wild, spawning occurs in the females' preferred cave. The same process frequently occurs in the home aquarium, with the ripe female leading the chosen male from his territory to her cave. Other times, the pair may be seen excavating a cave from scratch. The female then deposits her eggs (averaging around 100) on the sides of the cave, the male immediately swimming over them and fertilising with his sperm. It is not always obvious when these fish have spawned, as oftentimes they are very secretive and the cave may be hidden from view. Once spawning has finished, the female will tend to the eggs, with the male fish guarding the perimeter of the cave. The eggs should hatch within 3-4 days (temperature dependent), with the fry becoming free swimming some 7-10 days later. The young can be started off on a diet of freshly hatched brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and finely powdered first foods. Brood care is fairly prolonged, and the immature offspring may then help in guarding the subsequent generation of fry, coexisting within the same aquarium and forming a nuclear family. The cycle continues as the adults spawn again, and it is possible to have several generations living together.",

These fish are known as 'continual spawners' which means that the spawning activity takes place over several days/weeks. This can present problems to the aquarist in that some adult fish may begin to consume the eggs as they are scattered, although this may not be a problem if the adults are kept well fed. However, many fishkeepers have found the eggs to be remarkably tough and have had great success in siphoning them out into another aquarium (containing matching water from the spawning tank) or else using spawning mops, which, when having caught a number of the eggs, can be moved to a separate tank (again with matching water) and replaced with a new mop, as and when each series of eggs are deposited.

Eggs will be scattered in batches amongst the plants and marbles, and most should fall to safety. Once spawning eventually appears to cease, the parent fish should be removed to avoid predation. The eggs are somewhat sensitive, but under good conditions should hatch within 24-48 hours (temperature dependent). The fry should become free-swimming a further 24-48 hours later and can be fed on infusoria, Artemia nauplii and finely crushed egg-layer first foods.",

During the rainy season, they migrate into flooded forested areas to spawn, returning to the river as the waters recede.\nThis is a sizeable, but peaceful species which is suitable for the larger aquarium. Juveniles grow very quickly, so ample space must be provided from the outset. Red-tailed Tinfoil Barbs are a shoaling species and should be maintained in groups of six or more fish. Due to their size and feeding habits, a decent amount of external filtration should be provided, along with very regular partial water changes. The aquarium must be well-oxygenated. These fish appreciate a good amount of greenfood in the diet, and as such, aquatic plants will be seen as food - many aquarists choose to aquascape the aquarium either without plants or instead with plastic varieties. Red-tailed Tinfoil Barbs are not aggressive and mix well with other medium-large sized fish of similar temperament. However, due to their adult size, tankmates should be chosen with care as large Red-tailed Tinfoil Barbs are more than capable of taking small fish. The aquarium must be well-covered with a sturdy hood or coverslides as these fish can jump, and an adult fish can be pretty weighty. Similar in appearance to the Tinfoil Barb (B. schwanenfeldii) but lacks the black markings along the lobes of the caudal fin and does not attain quite as large a size.",

Ideally, the aquarium should be darkly furnished, with plenty of bogwood and areas of dense planting to replicate the natural habitat of these fish as closely as possible. Red Back Bleeding Heart Tetras are a shoaling species and do best in large groups; six specimens would be considered the absolute minimum. In larger groups you are more likely to observe the outstanding harmless natural displays between rival males, their dazzling colours intensifying further. These fish are generally of a peaceful disposition and mix well with fish of similar size and temperament. They can be quite easily bullied, so ensure that they are not housed with boisterous species. It is not advisable to keep Redback Bleeding Heart Tetras alongside fancy long-finned species, as sometimes the elaborate finnage can prove too much of a temptation.

        "care": "The Oranda is a selectively bred strain of goldfish. Domesticated goldfish date back to China's Ming dynasty and Fancy goldfish have long been popular aquarium pets, although often as a first venture into keeping an aquarium. This is a mixed blessing, as there are far better choices for small aquaria than these big, messy fishes. Given appropriate housing and care, fancy goldfish can attain a large size and easily live for more than 15-20 years. The aquarium should be spacious and ideally around 1.2 metres long to allow room for 30cm adults to be comfortable. The length and width of the tank are much more important than the height in this respect.\nFancy goldfish grow quickly so it is best to provide them with the largest aquarium that you can from the outset to provide a much safe, stable environment for them. The larger the volume of water, the more stable it will be in terms of water chemistry and temperature. During the warmer months, these fish can be kept outside in raised water features suitably filtered and protected from predators. This can be a great way to provide extra room for your pets and they'll benefit from the semi-natural conditions. Like any goldfish, Orandas will benefit from a seasonal drop in temperature and this can be provided by either moving them indoors in late autumn, or positioning their aquarium in a room that experiences cool room temperatures during the winter. Fancy goldfish are notoriously messy fish; they are voracious eaters and continually stir up the substrate in their ongoing search for food. Such considerable amounts of waste can lead to water quality issues in smaller aquaria if not monitored very closely. Efficient filtration that can handle copius solids is essential, and weekly partial water changes are advised in order to keep nitrate to a minimum. The water should be well-oxygenated (of particular importance during warmer spells of weather) and this is easily achieved by the use of spray-bar returns from filters or the use of an air pumps. Various species of robust plants can be added to the aquarium, but these will likely require periodic replacement due to them being uprooted/eaten - something most goldfish keepers accept and allow their fish to take pleasure in. The substrate can consist of rounded fine gravel or sand, and decor can include smooth rocks and ornaments with no sharp edges. Orandas are sociable creatures and should be kept in groups, either with their own kind or with other varieties of fancy goldfish. It is best, however, to avoid keeping the standard 'single-tailed' common goldfish alongside the fancy varieties as the common goldfish is a faster swimmer and may outcompete the fancies at feeding time.\nRedcap Oranda are very distinctive fish, although occasionally fantails carrying the red head colouration may be offered as 'Redcaps'",
        "feeding": "Due to their body shape, these fish need a high fibre diet and digestive problems are often the cause of buoyancy issues as transit times are compromised by convoluted digestive tracts. Goldfish also tend to swallow air in their rush to feed which also leads to problems which are best avoided by the use of sinking foods. These can be in the form of pellets, sticks or flake presented beneath the water surface. Frozen foods or live foods such as bloodworm, Mysis, and Daphnia will provide fibre and can be fed extensively to individuals displaying issues that are often categorised as Swim Bladder Disease. The opportunity to browse on aquatic plants will help to ensure gut health.",
        "breeding": "Well-conditioned fancy goldfish will often spawn in the home aquarium. Female fish will be noticeably rounder bellied when full of eggs, and the male fish will develop spawning tubercles (tiny raised bumps) on the gill plates and pectoral fins. A large, slightly cooler water change is often enough to trigger ready pairs into spawning. As the temperature slowly rises back up to its usual level, the male will pursue the female around the aquarium, but generally in a non-aggressive manner. This courtship ritual may last more than a day before spawning commences, and the colours of the fish often intensify at this time. The male fish will nudge the female into the fine-leaved plants (or spawning mops), where she will then scatter eggs which the male simultaneously fertilises. Spawning can last for a number of hours, and several thousand adhesive eggs may be scattered over the plants/spawning mop. The adults will be hungry and will start to devour as many eggs as they can find, so are best moved to another aquarium. The eggs take 4-5 days to hatch, depending on water temperature. Young fancy goldfish are often brown in colour (like their ancestors) and it can take up to a year before full colouration becomes apparent. Fancy goldfish often produce young that differ from their parents - high quality fish that show the best attributes of their breed are normally in the minority, hence the differences in price and quality between fish.",

        "care": "The Red Fin Kadango has a lake-wide distribution, where it is encountered in almost all rocky environments along the shorelines. The aquarium should be at least 5ft long and aquascaped with open expanses of sand in addition to a few rocky areas and some thickets of Vallisneria. D\u00c3\u00a9cor such as ocean rock can be used to build sturdy structures which stretch from the base of the tank to near the surface of the water. These structures should be built with the purpose of creating many crevices for the fish to explore but constructed in such a way so as to keep the rocks stable if the fish start to dig around and underneath them. Although a substrate of coral sand or Aragonite is often recommended to help to keep the water hard and alkaline, these fish feel safer and show better colours over a darker substrate. The Aragonite or coral sand can always be placed into a mesh bag and kept inside the external filter for buffering purposes. The Red Fin Kadango is a relatively peaceful species, and these fish are sometimes observed in large shoals in their natural habitat. In the home aquarium, groups can be maintained together, ideally consisting of one male with a harem of several females. However, if the tank is particularly voluminous, multiple males can be kept together (again with several females allocated to each), but do provide them with an abundance of hiding places/visual barriers so they are able to set up individual territories. Aggression will increase when ready to spawn, so careful observation is required. Suitable tankmates could include relatively peaceful rift lake fish such as other Haps, Aulonocara species, some of the more mild-mannered Mbuna, or Synodontis catfish etc. There are several geographical colour morphs available, including 'Mara Point', 'Mbenji', and 'Namalenje'.",

        "care": "The Redfin Notho is found in transitory water-filled depressions in coastal Tanzania. These pools can be heavily vegetated and the water depth gradually decreases as the dry season progresses. This beautiful species is an annual killifish, which means it only lives up to a year at most - so the need to reproduce is of high importance. As such, the young fishes develop very quickly in order to fulfil this need (sexual maturity is reached in a matter of weeks), and the resultant eggs are able to survive periods of drought in the substrate, hatching when the rainy season returns and thus providing a new generation to continue the cycle.\nThe Redfin Notho will bring activity and colour to the aquarium, but is best maintained in a species-only breeding tank, with 2 or more females to every male. If keeping more than one male in the same aquarium, do ensure that the tank is spacious and heavily decorated in order for rival males to retreat to safety if necessary. If tankmates are desired, these killifish can be kept alongside other species such as pencilfish, Kuhli loaches, Corydoras catfish, Sparkling/Croaking Gouramis etc., which all enjoy the same softwater conditions. They are, however, not suitable for the general community. When kept in a specialised community, the aquarium should be heavily planted (include floating species) with the incorporation of plenty of bogwood. Adding botanicals such as Catappa leaves is suggested to help keep the water soft, acidic and tannin stained, all of which will help to show the fish in their best colours. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement gentle. Small partial water changes should be carried out on a regular and frequent basis. Tight fitting coverslides are a must as these fish are expert jumpers.",
        "feeding": "Dried foods should be offered as a staple but are not always eagerly taken. Small live and frozen foods such as mosquito larvae, daphnia, cyclops, baby brineshrimp, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp etc. can be used to provide a varied diet. Females have a large calorific requirement, as they'll often be producing eggs on a daily basis!",
        "breeding": "In the wild, the natural habitat becomes completely desiccated during the dry season, and the adult fish die, leaving fertilised eggs within the substrate. The eggs can withstand the harsh, dry conditions and remain in situ until the rainy season starts a few months later. Once wet, the eggs hatch and the resultant fry grow and reach sexual maturity very quickly. If you wish to breed this species, it is best to add a plastic container to the aquarium that is lined with coir or fibrous peat (to about 2cm thickness) and a couple of stones to weigh it down, which will provide a suitable spawning medium. This allows for much easier removal of the eggs from the water. After a few days of spawning, lift the container from the aquarium, slowly pouring out as much water as possible. The substrate should then be gently squeezed to drain as much water out as you can. The eggs are quite robust, but do proceed carefully. Place the spawning medium onto a paper towel to air dry for a few hours, then seal in a plastic bag. The eggs and moss should then be left in the bag at a steady room temperature for around 2-3 months: this replicates the dry season. Keep checking the eggs. When they are ready to hatch, the eyes of the fry will be visible through the eggs. Eggs that have not yet developed will be clear. Once the eyes are visible, you can be certain that the eggs are ready for the start of the simulated rainy season. Undo the bag and gently place the peat moss in a container, ensuring that the moss is spread out evenly. Add some mature aquarium water to a depth of 5cm with a small amount of aquarium salt added - this will help to prevent Velvet disease. Hatching will occur quickly, with the fry emerging in a matter of hours. Once free-swimming, they can be offered infusoria followed by newly hatched brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii).",

        "care": "The Redfin Peppered Tiger Loach is known from swiftly-flowing, clear, highly-oxygenated rivers and streams. During the rainy season, when water depth/flow increases and the water temperature drops, they migrate into flooded areas to spawn, usually staying close to submerged trees, logs, and roots. The waterways are usually lined with riparian vegetation, and the substrate is comprised of sand, bedrock, driftwood, and small boulders, creating an endless labyrinth of effective hiding places. In some areas there will be fast current as water is forced past haphazard rockwork. As with all botiids, these loaches must only be added to aquariums that are biologically mature. However, unlike their close relatives, the Botia spp., the pointy-faced Syncrossus genus of loaches grow larger and are exceptionally aggressive and territorial. It is essential that a spacious aquarium is provided, and numerous hiding spots and \"\u02dcvisual barriers\"\u2122 created with driftwood, smooth rounded rocks, cobbles, and pebbles of varying sizes. Ensure that the substrate has no sharp edges as these loaches will enjoy digging around the bottom of the tank in their search for titbits of food, and it is important that nothing damages their delicate sensory barbels. Dim lighting is preferable, and a well-covered tank is a must as these loaches are expert jumpers and can escape through the smallest of openings. Powerful filtration (ideally provided by external canister/s) and a decent level of oxygenation are requisite, as are frequent partial water changes. Like other fish from riverine habitats, these loaches are intolerant of a build up of organic pollutants, so ensure that a regular partial water change schedule is in place. As mentioned above, Redfin Peppered Tiger Loaches are extremely hostile towards other fish, and in the confines of the home aquarium, this can include their own kind. However, despite the hostility, they do form fascinating highly complex social structures within a group, and their physical health will suffer if they don\"\u2122t have contact with more of their own species. To this end, they should always be maintained in large groups of 8 or more. This will not only meet their social needs but it will help spread any aggression amongst the shoal, so that no one fish bears the continual brunt of the antagonistic behaviour. It is also why adequate space and visual barriers are so important. Tankmates, if desired, must be chosen with much care - only large, robust, fast-swimming species that can hold their own should be considered (large but placid species, even if larger than the loaches, will be mercilessly bullied). Some aquarists like to keep more than one species of Syncrossus loach together; this usually works well, but do make sure there are several of each species and not just single specimens. In addition to the tiger loaches, some of the Yasuhikotakia species of loach also cohabit well with Syncrossus due to their similar belligerent behaviour and environmental needs. Several different geographical variants are sometimes available, the colour and intensity of pattern depending on collection location and maturity.

        "care": "The Redhead Tapajos Eartheater is a familiar but only recently described species known only from the lower Rio Tapajos, a major tributary of the Amazon River. The typical habitat has little in the way of aquatic vegetation, but instead, large expanses of sand and scattered rocks, leaf litter, and submerged tree roots.\nThe aquarium should be biologically mature and spacious, with a large expanse of soft sand substrate as these fish like to sift through the substrate in their ongoing search for food items. Provide plenty of hiding places amongst tangles of driftwood, rocky caves, and robust planting cultivated on the wood (such as Anubias sp. or Java Fern). Vegetation planted into the substrate is likely to be dug up, so is best avoided. Filtration should be efficient with areas of moderate water movement and some calmer resting spots out of the current. Frequent partial water changes will help keep nitrate to a minimum, particularly important as this species is sensitive to deteriorating water conditions. Unless breeding, the Redhead Tapajos Eartheater is generally peaceful, and in the wild is found in loose aggregations. In the aquarium, this species is best maintained in groups of 6 or more so that a natural hierarchy can form. This will not only meet their social needs but it will help spread any minor aggression amongst the shoal, so that no one fish bears the continual brunt of any sporadic antagonistic behaviour. Tankmates can include deep-bodied tetras, Angelfish and most species too large to be swallowed whole as these are generally peaceful cichlids and aggressive companions should be avoided. Although peaceful, they can be problematic if combined with catfish as they are likely to outcompete slow-feeding bottom dwellers.  \nMay also be seen on sale as Geophagus sp. 'orange head' and the new binomial name translates as Fire Head, so this may possibly emerge as an alternative common name. An albino form has recently appeared and may be seen more frequently if it proves as colourful and vigorous as the wild type.",

        "breeding": "This species has been bred in the home aquarium. When ready to spawn, there will be a typical courtship display consisting of circling, fin-flashing, lateral displays, and mouth gaping. If the female is receptive, she will swim over the chosen pre-cleaned spawning site in a series of dry runs, after which she will begin depositing eggs in small batches. The male immediately follows behind her and fertilises them, and this is repeated until the female is spent of eggs. The female stays with the eggs, fanning them with her pectoral fins, whilst the male guards the perimeter. 48-72 hours later, the eggs will hatch (the parents may assist with this) and the wrigglers are taken up into the mouths of both the female and male, who share in incubating the young for a further 8-10 days until they are free-swimming. At this point they can be offered Artemia nauplii and powdered flake food. If the parents sense danger, the fry are urged back into their mouths as quickly as possible. Sometimes only one parent takes on mouthbrooding duties, whereas other times both are involved, or they take turns.",

Here, this gregarious species is observed in large shoals in the calmer sections of rivers where there is abundant marginal and overhanging riparian vegetation. This is a timid, but peaceful, shoaling species, juveniles of which will require an aquarium at least 4ft long. These fast-swimming fish grow very quickly and before long will require an aquarium measuring at least 6\"\u2122 x 2\"\u2122 x 2\"\u2122. They must have company of their own kind, and 6 specimens would be considered to be the minimum number to house together. Larger groups will help to make them feel much more secure. The aquarium itself should be sited in a quiet location where it does not receive a large amount of continual foot traffic going past. These are very skittish fish that are easily startled, so they must be provided with many shady hiding spots within the aquarium and some very tight fitting coverslides to prevent them from accidentally jumping out. D\u00c3\u00a9cor must be chosen with care as anything sharp can cause them injury whenever they decide to make a dash for cover. When cleaning the aquarium, much care must be taken to ensure that these nervous fish do not become too startled. Redhook Myleus are largely herbivorous and possess quite powerful dentition. They will devour most plant species in their aquarium, however, more robust species such as Java Fern or Anubias can sometimes be successful; otherwise you may wish to opt for plastic or silk varieties. Filtration should be efficient with moderate water movement and some calmer resting areas out of the current. A good level of oxygenation is important, and excellent water quality must be maintained at all times, as these fish are sensitive to elevated nitrate levels. Keep lighting as dim as possible, and do not house with any small (bite-sized) or aggressive species.",

She will then immediately back up and take the eggs into her oral cavity, and will then position herself near to the male's vent to take in milt, which fertilises the eggs intrabucally. This will be repeated many times, until ~60 eggs have been fertilised and taken into the female's mouth for incubation. Once the female has gathered up all the eggs, the pair disperse, with the female providing broodcare on her own. Many aquarists choose to remove the male from the tank at this point to prevent stress or injury to the holding female. Incubation takes around 14-21 days, and upon release, the young can be offered baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and crushed flake foods. The female demonstrates excellent broodcare and will offer the fry shelter in her mouth for a further 3 weeks or so, after which time the youngsters will have become too large to all fit in her mouth at once.",

In many places the substrate is composed of leaf litter. The home aquarium should contain soft, acidic water and be biologically mature before these fishes are added. Ideally there will be dark substrate and dense planting, with plenty of hiding places/territories amongst rocks, driftwood, coconut shells etc. Floating plant cover could be used to help diffuse the light. Peat filtration and the addition of dried Indian Almond Leaves (Terminalia catappa) would be beneficial to help create the favoured conditions, and be aware that the tank should have a tight fitting cover, as these fish can jump. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement gentle, and frequent partial water changes should be carried out in order to keep nitrate at a minimum. Redline Apistos are generally peaceful, but can become rather territorial when breeding. Some older literature asserts that unlike many other Apistogramma species, A. hongsloi does not tend to practice harem breeding. However, others have challenged this statement having witnessed their fish spawning in a harem situation. Therefore we would recommend to keep either a single pair, or in larger aquaria, one male with several females. The females will seek out individual territories, hence the importance of many visual barriers within the tank. Good tankmates include Corydoras catfish, hatchetfish, pencilfish, small tetras, and suckermouth catfish. May also be seen on sale as Red Line Dwarf Cichlid. Several colour forms are usually available, including 'gold', 'red', and 'super red'.",

Ideally, each female fish will be provided with a suitable spawning site in the form of a cave or flower pot on its side. 60-90 eggs will be laid on the ceiling of the cave or pot, and these will be guarded by the female. The male fish will guard the general harem territory. The eggs should hatch after 2 to 4 days, depending on water temperature. The female continues guarding the wrigglers, and after a further few days, will lead the fry out of the cave. She will be very pugnacious at this point, fending off any would-be predators. The fry will require frequent small feeds with appropriately sized foodstuffs at this point, such as baby brineshrimp. If the spawning has occurred in a general community tank, it is a good idea to feed the other fish their food at the opposite end of the aquarium at the same time, to avoid undue stress to the female, who will be desperately trying to guard her young. Sometimes the female will take the fry up in her mouth and move them to another area of the tank.",

        "care": "The Reed Fish is a snake-like species that is consistently popular with many oddball enthusiasts. These elongated fish are known from slow flowing rivers and even standing waters with relatively low oxygen content, where they live amongst labyrinthine reedy habitats. In addition to moving snake-wise over the substrate, they can also side-wind through the water column at a fairly rapid pace. As a nocturnal species, Reed Fish are most active during the night when they will spend time searching for and feeding on crustaceans, insects, and worms. An aquarium that houses this species should be spacious - ideally at least 5ft x 2ft x 2ft for adult specimens - and very well covered, as these fish are great escape artists. Ensure that any gaps where wires feed in to the aquarium are plugged securely with filter foam or mesh glued into place. The lid of the aquarium may also need to be weighted down. Reed Fish have the ability to breathe atmospheric air via their modified swim bladders (part of which functions as an accessory breathing organ to allow them to survive out of water for a time), so a small gap MUST be left between the surface of the water and the cover slides in order for the fish to come up to the surface and take air in. If the fish are denied regular access to air above the surface of the water, they may actually drown, so always run the tank with a dropped waterline. The substrate should consist of soft sand as these fish spend a lot of time foraging about on the bottom of the tank, and may even submerge themselves completely beneath it if startled. Smooth water worn rocks and spindly driftwood can be used to create shady caves and there should be areas of dense planting with tall, hardy species such as Vallisneria and large Anubias or Aponogeton spp. Illumination should not be too bright, or if it is, it should be diffused via heavy planting. A blue moon light timed to come on just before the main lights switch off will allow you to view the night-time antics of these fascinating fish. The water should be filtered efficiently but gently, so that the fish do not have to contend with an overwhelming current. The Reed Fish is the sole representative of the Erpetoichthys genus, and is closely related to the Polypterus genus, both of which are considered to be the last surviving relatives of some very ancient, primitive species. As their eyesight is quite poor, Reed Fish rely on their excellent sense of smell in order to locate food items, and although carnivorous by nature, they are generally very peaceful, and can be kept successfully alongside other medium sized peaceable species. Avoid any tankmates which are small enough to fit into their mouths, as they will be predated upon overnight. Good companions could include some of the medium sized, relatively peaceful cichlid species such as Angelfish, Severums or Festivums, or large Trichogaster gouramis, and Synodontis catfish. Avoid any really boisterous species though, as otherwise they may outcompete your Reed Fish at feeding times. Gregarious by nature, keep Reed Fish in good sized groups. There are reports of a monster 90cm specimen having once been seen, but this has never been substantiated, a maximum length of 50cm being much more typical. Be aware that although Reed Fish are considered quite hardy and will acclimatise to a wide range of conditions, they do not handle swings in pH well at all. Likewise, nitrates should not be allowed to creep up, so ensure that small partial water changes are carried out on a regular basis. This species is recommended for advanced aquarists only. May also be seen on sale as the Rope Fish.",
        "feeding": "These carnivores rarely take dried foods in captivity, so you must be prepared to offer them various meaty frozen foods. Smaller specimens will enjoy bloodworm, white mosquito larvae, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp etc. whereas larger specimens will take bigger foods such as Mysis shrimp, chopped krill/prawns/mussels, earthworms etc. Occasional specimens have been known to take sinking carnivore pellets (pre-soaked in aquarium water to prevent choking \"\u201c Reed Fish are notorious for gulping food down), but this is not the norm. Always try and feed just before lights out, as this is when these fish are naturally most active.",
        "breeding": "Challenging - would make an excellent breeding project for the serious, dedicated hobbyist. Until fairly recently, little was known about the reproductive habits of Reed Fish. However, an established group of fish spawned successfully in captivity during the 1990s. These fish were estimated to be around 15 years old, so it seems that this species may take some time to reach sexual maturity. During courtship, the male and female swim parallel to one another, in a graceful fashion, usually through clumps of plants. The male will make jerking sideways movements with his head, towards the female\"\u2122s body. If she is ready to spawn, she will stop swimming and the male will wrap his anal fin around her genital opening. Both fish will remain motionless whilst a few eggs are deposited in a cup formed by the male\"\u2122s anal fin, and there they will be fertilised before being dispersed by powerful movements of his tail. The eggs, 2.1-2.6mm in diameter, are adhesive and will stick to the plants. This procedure is repeated many times until the female is spent of eggs. The adults exhibit no parental care. Larvae hatch after approximately 70 hours, but remain attached to the vegetation whilst they absorb their yolk sacs. Some 2.5-3 weeks later they will begin feeding. At this stage they have external gills with many branches and resemble salamander larvae (these external gills are lost as the fish grows). In the wild, these fish are known to spawn throughout the year, but with a peak of heightened activity once during the year.",

        "care": "The Reed Tetra is known from shallow, moderately turbid channels, swamps, and small tributaries where the water is soft and acidic and densely packed with aquatic vegetation. These diminutive shoaling fish form large aggregations, and are often joined by the very similar-looking Corydoras hastatus (which unusually for a Corydoras species, swims in midwater). This mimetic relationship is thought to afford the Corydoras improved foraging opportunities and better protection from predators.\nReed Tetras are a peaceful species, ideal for mature softwater aquaria. Thanks to their Southerly distribution they're also a good choice for an unheated aquarium. The tank should be furnished with plenty of driftwood to create lots of shady areas, and the tannins that are gradually released from the wood should help to acidify the water whilst giving it a natural, clear tea-colour (and the fish often show enhanced colours under such conditions). Peat filtration can also help in this respect. Dense planting, both rooted and floating, will help to make the fish feel secure. Lighting should not be too bright (tannins and floating plants can help to diffuse brighter lighting), and darker substrate and background choices will help to show off their beautiful colours. Reed Tetras should always be maintained in good sized groups, 6 would be the minimum recommended, 10+ would be much better. Not only will the fish feel more secure, but this will result in a far more effective, natural-looking shoal. Tankmates should also be small and peaceful and able to thrive in the same conditions. Ideal tankmates could include Corydoras catfish (in particular, a group of C. hastatus would make for a most interesting addition), dwarf cichlids such as Apistogramma borelli or trifasciata and some of the smaller Loricariidae (suckermouth catfish).\nReed Tetras are similar in appearance to the Kitty Tetra (H. heliacus), but the latter shows a golden body colour instead of the silver of this species. The scientific name \"elachys\" is from the Greek for little or small, and alludes to the small adult size of these fish. It's rare to see Reed tetras labelled correctly, as most arrive misidentified as Kitty tetras.",
        "feeding": "Flake, micropellets, small frozen foods such as daphnia, mini bloodworm, cyclops, baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) etc.",
        "breeding": "This species has been bred in the home aquarium, and although it is reported to be rather straightforward, precise details seem to be few and far between. In the confines of a well planted tank, you may see small numbers of young appear from time to time. However if you wish to raise a good number of fry, a small separate breeding aquarium should be set up for the purpose with soft, acidic water. Prior to the spawning attempt, condition your fish on plenty of small meaty live or frozen foods. Clumps of Java moss or a few bunches of fine-leaved plants should be added to the breeding tank to give the fish somewhere to scatter their eggs, and very gentle filtration should be provided via an air-driven sponge filter. No dedicated lighting should be used, as eggs and fry can be a little light sensitive. Acclimatise a mix of both sexes across to the new tank very carefully during the evening, and in the morning, when sunlight hits the tank, spawning should commence. The parents should be removed immediately after spawning ceases as they will predate on the eggs. Alternatively, some aquarists like to use a fine mesh in the tank so that the scattered eggs can fall to safety, away from the attention of the adult fish. Ideally try and keep the tank in darkness once eggs have been scattered, to protect them and the resultant sensitive young fry from being damaged by bright light. Alder cones can be very useful in helping to prevent the eggs from fungussing. Once the eggs have hatched, the young will feed from their yolk sacs for a short time. As soon as they become free-swimming, microscopic foodstuffs such as infusoria/Paramecium should then be offered, followed by baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) as they grow.",

        "care": "Regan's Julie is has a widespread distribution throughout Lake Tanganyika, where it is found in the shallow, sediment-rich rocky habitat. Here, their territories tend to be centred around cracks or fissures in the rocks and rubble. The natural diet consists primarily of small crustaceans, insect larvae, and molluscs picked from the algae-encrusted substrate, and occasionally, drifting plankton. The aquarium that houses this species should be at least 4ft long, with a good amount of filtration, water movement and oxygenation. The best choice of substrate would be coral sand or aragonite, which will help to keep the water hard and alkaline. Rocks should be used to create small outcrops and plenty of caves/crevices, ensuring that there are ample broken lines-of-sight. J. regani can be somewhat aggressive towards one another in the confines of the home aquarium, so in most situations, they are best kept singly or in compatible pairs. These cichlids can be maintained as part of a Tanganyikan community with fish of similar size and temperament, and which occupy different areas of the tank; however, do not mix them with other Julidochromis species. If the tank is particularly voluminous, multiple pairs can be kept as long as there are plenty of territories to go round (several per fish) and a multitude of visual barriers. Regan's Julies are intolerant of poor water conditions, so ensure small partial water changes are carried out on a frequent basis.

In order to obtain a compatible pair, it is often best to purchase a group of juveniles and to allow a pair to form naturally, rehoming the remaining fish. The pair will choose a suitable cave as a spawning site, and when ready, the female will deposit her eggs (averaging 30-50) on the sides/roof of the cave, the male immediately swimming over them and fertilising with his sperm. It is not always obvious when these fish have spawned, as oftentimes they are very secretive and the cave may be hidden from view. Once spawning has finished, the female will tend to the eggs, with the male fish guarding the perimeter of the cave. The eggs should hatch within 2-3 days (temperature dependent), with the fry becoming free swimming a few days later. The young can be started off on a diet of freshly hatched brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and finely powdered \"\u02dcfirst foods\"\u2122. Brood care is fairly prolonged, and the immature offspring may then help in guarding the subsequent generation of fry, coexisting within the same aquarium and forming a nuclear family. The cycle continues as the adults spawn again, and it is possible to have several generations living together if the tank is large enough. However, if the aquarium is on the smaller side, and there becomes a shortage of territories, it may be best to rehome the eldest fry once they reach around 2.5cm/1\" in size, for their own safety.",

        "care": "Regan's Dwarf Pike Cichlid is known from much of the Amazon basin, where it is found in the calmer waters of small tributaries that are thick with leaf litter and submerged roots. This beautiful, elongate dwarf cichlid must be provided with soft, acidic water if it is to thrive in the home aquarium. Due to its territorial nature, this species requires a large aquarium compared to its eventual adult size, along with a soft sandy substrate and plenty of nooks and crannies formed from piles of pebbles, rocks, pieces of smooth slate, and tangles of driftwood - ensuring that there are some broken lines of sight for the fish to set up territories. Unfortunately, plants grown in the substrate may be uprooted, but species such as Anubias and Java Fern can be tied onto and cultivated on the driftwood. This will not only help with water quality, but will make the aquarium look more aesthetically pleasing, as well as creating more welcome hiding places. Dried Indian Almond Leaves (Terminalia catappa) could be placed on top of the substrate to create a more natural feel, and as these gradually decompose, they will release tannins that will not only help to acidify the water, but will also bring out the best colours of the fish (these leaves will require periodic replacement). Filtration should be efficient, with areas of moderate water movement and some quieter resting spots out of the current. Small, frequent water changes will help keep nitrate to a minimum. This is a mildly aggressive species that is probably the gentlest of the Crenicichla genus. However, they are still somewhat territorial and will predate on smaller fish. The best way to keep these cichlids is either as a known compatible pair, or in dense groups (10+) within more spacious aquaria. Ideally, try and outnumber males with females, and remember that groups which are too small could result in constant territorial bickering and subsequent losses. A larger group (housed in a tank with a multitude of visual barriers) will ensure that no one fish bears the brunt of any squabbles and is subjected to constant stress - any arguments will be spread throughout the group. These cichlids will be at their best in a species-only aquarium, but can be kept with other robust softwater fish that are of similar size (anything smaller will be regarded as food). Ensure that the tank has tight fitting coverslides as these fish are expert jumpers.",

These beautiful \"suckerbelly\" loaches have evolved to live in extremely fast-flowing waters, where they use their pectoral and pelvic fins to form a \"suction cup\" in order to hang on to smooth rocks amongst rapids. This high-velocity habitat must be replicated in the home aquarium by use of extra powerheads (in addition to the return flow from filters) to create a river type effect. The surface of the water should be visibly moving to ensure that there is a very high amount of oxygenation within the water at all times. An additional air-pump is also a handy back-up. Without such a high level of oxygenation and water movement, Sewellia lineolata will not fare well at all. These delicate fish should really only be added to aquariums that are well mature. Such tanks will have a good established growth of algae for the fish to graze upon in order to consume the micro-organisms within, and will provide a source of nourishment whilst the fish may be adapting to the taking of prepared foods. The front glass can be wiped free of algae, but it is recommended that you allow algae to freely colonise the sides and back glass, and over the decor. Lighting should be bright in order to encourage a decent amount of algal growth. Ideally, the aquarium will be at least 36\" long, and contain a multitude of hiding spots amongst rocks, cobbles and bogwood. Flat smooth rocks should be placed in the path of the flow, where these fish will often congregate just as they would do in their natural boulder-strewn habitats. Plants can be incorporated into the river style aquarium, but not all species will fare well under the extreme flow conditions. Having said this, many aquarists have had a good deal of success with Anubias species, Java moss (Taxiphyllum barbieri), Java fern (Microsorum sp.) and some species of Cryptocoryne. Plants are not found in great abundance in the natural habitat of Sewellia lineolata, so are not considered essential, but they will help with water quality and will make the aquarium look more aesthetically pleasing. Indeed, many aquarists have observed their loaches resting on the tips of broad leaved plants, \"surfing\" in the current with obvious enjoyment. These spectacular fish deserve a specialist aquarium to meet their needs. Their quirky behaviour is something totally out of the ordinary and is a joy to observe. They can be kept alongside other sub-tropical current-loving species such as White Cloud Mountain Minnows and many species from the Danio family, plus other similar hillstream loach species. This species can be very sensitive to the shipping process, so be sure that your dealer rests them after import and whilst doing so, keeps them in suitable highly oxygenated conditions.

        "care": "The Reticulatus Stingray is has a wide area of distribution, through much of the Amazon basin and numerous smaller rivers including the Rio Orinoco and Rio Paran\u00c3\u00a1. Here, it is found in a variety of habitats, but most commonly encountered in shallow, slow-moving tributaries over sandy or muddy substrates. This beautiful bottom-dweller grows large, and requires a voluminous aquarium with powerful filtration to match. The length and width of the tank is generally much more important than the height, giving this fish as much floor space as possible and allowing for the fish to turn freely with the long tail. The aquarium must be biologically mature before adding this species. A soft sand substrate is essential, as stingrays spend the majority of their time on the bottom and like to bury themselves in the substrate from time to time (with just the eyes protruding), as well as searching out food items on the sand. When resting on or in the substrate, small openings located on the top of the head (known as spiracles) draw water into the gill chambers to facilitate oxygen exchange. Decor is not overly necessary for stingrays, as a large expanse of sand is much more important for their continued wellbeing. Some tangles of driftwood and smooth rocks could be incorporated, but these must be very secure, and not take up very much of the floor space. The Reticulatus Stingray is a voracious eater that produces a lot of waste, and requires continuous excellent water conditions. To this end, filtration must be powerful and the water well-oxygenated. A frequent partial water change regime is absolutely essential as this fish will not tolerate an elevated nitrate level. Several huge canister filters can be employed, but sump filtration may be more prudent as then equipment such as heaters can be kept in the sump and out of the main tank where they would be very easily damaged. Lighting should be fairly dim, as these fish do not enjoy bright illumination. Stingrays are not particularly sociable and are best maintained either singly, as a male/female pair, or one male with a group of females. Male fish can be rather rough with one another, so it's best to house only one male per tank. Tankmates (if desired) must be chosen very carefully, as stingrays are highly proficient predators; however, despite this, they will fail to thrive if housed with boisterous or territorial species. The best companions would be large, passive midwater or surface-dwelling fish. Avoid keeping with Loricariids (suckermouth catfish) as within the confines of the home aquarium, there are many documented instances of them attaching themselves and rasping away at the flat, disc-shaped body of stingrays, causing injury. Ensure the tank has tight fitting coverslides that are weighted down, as these fish are expert jumpers. Take extra care when offering food, as it is not unusual for the stingray to swim up and breach the water's surface during all the excitement of a feeding frenzy. Like all species from this genus, P. orbignyi is equipped with one or more barbed spines that are found on the dorsal surface of the middle section of the tail. These spines are coated with an extremely toxic mucus that inflicts very painful wounds, and tends to be employed in defence or when the fish is alarmed. Always handle stingrays with much care. When these fish need to be moved, they should always be herded into a solid container, rather than using a net. If you are stung by a Potamotrygon spp. stingray, seek immediate medical help for pain relief and to ensure no part of the stinger remains in the wound (this could lead to a serious secondary infection). These fish shed their stingers every 2-3 months and new ones grow in their place. Be aware that discarded stingers can remain venomous for some time, so exercise caution when carrying out tank maintenance. This fish is long-lived (20+ years) and a fascinating species to look after, but it is quite the commitment so do ensure that all of its specific care requirements can be met before purchase. May also be seen on sale as the Reticulated Stingray or Smooth Back River Stingray. This is one of the most commonly seen species labelled as \"Teacup Ray\" in the trade. Teacup Rays are not actually a species in their own right, just small juveniles of various Potamotrygon species (most commonly this one). Whilst P. orbignyi will eventually attain quite a size, they do not get as large as some of the other members of the same genus, so are considered one of the best species for newcomers to stingray keeping.",
        "feeding": "Juveniles can be offered bloodworm, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, Mysis shrimp, and chopped krill. Adults should be offered larger foodstuffs such as cockles, mussels, prawns, river shrimp, silversides, whitebait, and pieces of white fish flesh. Stingrays have a fast metabolism and require feeding 2-3 times per day (which is why powerful filtration and a strict water change regime is absolutely essential).",
        "breeding": "The Reticulatus Stingray has been bred in the home aquarium, and like other Potamotrygon spp. reproduces via a breeding strategy known as matrotrophic viviparity. Stingrays take many years to become sexually mature, so patience may be required, particularly if starting out with fairly young fish. As the courtship ritual can be a somewhat violent affair, it is essential that the female is larger than the male so that she can defend herself adequately from the male's advances, which includes incessant chasing and rough biting. Always observe carefully just in case the female is not receptive, as the fish may need separating for safety reasons. When ready to spawn, the pair briefly go belly-to-belly, with the male inserting one of his claspers into the female's cloaca, fertilisation taking place internally. Gestation usually lasts 2-3 months, and a typical sized litter would number between 1 and 8 (the young often referred to as 'pups'). The pups develop inside the mother, nourished by secretions from her villi (umbilical filaments), and when they are born, they are fully-formed miniatures of the adults. It is essential that the female receives good, nutritious feedings during the gestation period as she will expend a lot of energy when carrying and nourishing her pups. Once the pups are born, it may be best to move them carefully to other quarters, as although predation is rare, it is not unheard of. There is also the matter of the water becoming very clouded during the birth when bodily fluids are released, so the main tank will require a large water change (which the pups might be sensitive to). The pups will feed from their yolk sacs for the first week or so, after which time they can be offered a variety of small meaty frozen foods. A compatible pair of stingrays may attempt to breed regularly, and as this can be rather hard on the female, it may be best to separate the pair after every couple of litters, in order for her to recover properly and have a rest from such an energy-intensive process.",

        "care": "Reynolds Cory, also sometimes known as the Bumblebee Cory, is a peaceful bottom-dwelling catfish that is ideally suited to mature community aquaria. Described in 1960, this species was discovered in the Caquet province of eastern Colombia, which was quite far away from the usual fish collecting hotspots, hence it remained unknown in the hobby for some time. The habitat was shallow, sandy-bottomed, warm waters with gentle current.\nThe aquarium should be aquascaped with a soft, sandy substrate in order to protect the delicate sensory barbels of these fish, and plenty of shady hiding places should be provided amongst aquatic plants and driftwood. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement gentle. Keep in groups of 5 or more due to their sociable, shoaling nature and with tankmates that are small and peaceful. This is a delicate species which is, unfortunately, a little more susceptible to bacterial infections than other members of the genus. Frequent partial water changes are a must for these catfish, as they can be very sensitive to elevated nitrate levels. Warm, soft, slightly acidic water seems to serve them well. This species is not recommended for beginners. Corydoras have the ability to breathe air intestinally, so a small gap should be left between the surface of the water and the cover slides in order for the fish to come up to the surface and take air in. It may do this numerous times per day.\nA fairly similar-looking species that is also referred to as a Bumblebee Cory and which was exported from Brazil during the late 1990s initially referred to as Corydoras sp. Asher was formally described in 2003 as Corydoras tukano and now becomes H. tukano.\nHoplisoma was recently split from Corydoras and contains many familiar species.",
        "feeding": "Offer a variety of sinking catfish pellets, plus frozen foods such as bloodworm, white mosquito larvae, daphnia, and vitamin-enriched brineshrimp. Many keepers note that this species is rather more active during the evening and into the night, so be sure to coincide this with feeding times.",
        "breeding": "This species has been bred in the home aquarium. In order to raise a good number of fry to adulthood, set up a separate breeding tank for some well-conditioned adult reynoldsi. The breeding set-up should include a sand substrate and several plants (including clumps of Java moss) which they can use as a spawning medium. A cool partial water change usually triggers the fish into action; after a courtship ritual, the fish should spawn in the usual T-position with the female depositing the large fertilised eggs one at a time onto the plants, substrate, tank glass, or other decor - it seems that anywhere is suitable. The adults should not predate on the eggs, but many aquarists choose to remove them and acclimatise them back to the main community aquarium. Once the eggs have hatched (this will be temperature dependent, but usually between 3 and 4 days) the larvae will feed from their yolk sacs for the first few days. After this time, the fry will require very regular feedings with baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii), microworms, and powdered flake foods. It is very important to maintain pristine water conditions at all times, and this can be tricky when feeding so regularly - siphon any debris from the bottom of the tank whilst performing daily small partial water changes (use water that matches in temperature and other parameters). A very small amount of a propriety anti-fungal agent may need to be added to the water to prevent fungal spores from attacking the eggs.",

        "care": "The Rice-paddy Eel is a member of the Ophichthidae family of snake eels, and is known from lagoons, estuaries, tidal reaches and upstream areas of coastal rivers, where they live in small holes in the banks and crevices in the bedrocks. During the rainy season, these gregarious, elongate fish migrate into freshwater areas such as rice paddies, in order to spawn. Nocturnal by nature, Rice-paddy Eels are most active at night, where they forage about for the small fishes which form the bulk of their diet. To be comfortable, adult fish will require a spacious aquarium of around 6ft in length, and with as much width as possible. There should be a soft sand substrate to allow them to burrow (gravel could damage their delicate bodies), along with plenty of smooth rocks to create crevices to hide in. Plants are not essential, but they may make the tank look more aesthetically pleasing, and floating varieties can be used to diffuse bright lighting; however, they will need to be species that can tolerate the addition of salt. It is vital that the tank has tight fitting coverslides, and ensure that any gaps around wires feeding in to the aquarium are plugged securely with filter foam, as these inquisitive fish are great escape artists. Likewise, if housing smaller specimens, do ensure they are protected from any filter or powerhead intakes as they do like to try and squeeze into tiny nooks and crannies. Although Rice-paddy Eels are peaceful, they are piscivorous, and will take small fishes overnight. For this reason, any tankmates (if desired) should be peaceable, but of a size large enough not to become a snack. Due to their highly social nature, we would recommend keeping in groups of 5 or more. A blue moon light timed to come on just before the main lights go out, will allow you to view the fascinating antics of these nocturnal creatures. Although they tend to stay buried for much of the day with just their snouts protruding from the sand or cover of the rockwork, they do become very active at night. As these eels are abundant and popular as a food fish in their native habitats, they do tend to be fairly inexpensive to buy, which makes it easier to acquire a good sized group. Clean, well-filtered water is essential. This fish may also be seen on sale as the Glass Eel. Not suitable for beginners or for the general community aquarium.",

This hefty, characterful bottom-dweller requires a very spacious aquarium with a soft sand substrate. The footprint of the tank (length and width) is much more important than the height, so always aim for a tank as long and wide as possible. Juveniles grow quickly and so a voluminous aquarium is required from the outset. There should be a number of hiding places/visual barriers amongst large driftwood pieces, rocky caves, and wide-bore PVC pipes. The more hiding places that are provided, the more the catfish is likely to venture out and about, as it will get to know it has safe places to quickly retreat to if it feels the need. Dim lighting is preferred, but this can be brighter if it is diffused with robust motherplants such as Anubias or Java Fern tied onto the decor, or floating vegetation. A blue moon light timed to come on just before the main lights switch off will provide you with time in the evening to watch the nocturnal antics of this catfish under its preferred subdued conditions. These fish are messy eaters and therefore produce a lot of nitrogenous waste, so it is essential to run powerful filtration on the aquarium - ideally with 2 or more canister filters, so that if one should fail or requires maintenance, there is back up. Frequent, partial water changes are an absolute must in order to keep the nitrate level as low as possible. There should be areas of brisk water movement, coupled with calmer areas, and a balance of shady retreats and ample swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Ensure that your heater has a safety guard fitted, as these catfish have a habit of resting up against the heater and can end up with severe burns. Despite its adult size, this is a gentle giant that is best maintained in groups if space permits. It can even be trusted with smaller fish, although to be absolutely sure, these should be at least 25% of the length of the catfish.

These structures should be built with the purpose of creating many crevices for the fish to explore but constructed in such a way so as to keep the rocks stable if the fish start to dig around and underneath them. Filtration should be efficient, with moderate water flow and a good level of oxygenation. Regular partial water changes will help keep nitrate to a minimum.

When a female is receptive, the pair will circle each other in a head to tail manner a number of times, until the female deposits her eggs. These are deposited just one or two at a time and after doing so, she immediately turns around and picks them up. At the same time, the male will rotate so that he is almost on his side, at the same time shaking and extending his anal fin, releasing his milt. The female sees the egg spots on the male's anal fin and attempts to pick up those dummy eggs whilst she is picking up the real ones that she deposited, and at the same time taking in milt. This is the method of fertilisation, and this ritual may go on for some time until the female is spent of eggs. She will incubate the eggs in her mouth for up to 3 weeks before releasing free-swimming fry, which can immediately be offered baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and crushed flake food.",

A large group normally dispels these traits. The aquarium should incorporate a good flow rate with areas of dense planting and a large open swimming space in the centre. Only hardy or fast-growing plants should be used, as Rosy Barbs will enjoy consuming fine-leaved or soft-leaved species. Due to their dynamic behaviour, they may unsettle shy, quiet fish species.

The natural habitat is shallow, flooded grassland that is permanently maintained due to the damming of springs. Here, the water is clear and a maximum of 30cm (12\") in depth, supporting an abundance of lush aquatic vegetation, primarily Anacharis and Elodea species. The Rosy Loach occurs sympatrically with Danio margaritatus (the Celestial Pearl Danio/Fireworks 'Rasbora') and an undescribed Microrasbora species which is similar in appearance to M. rubescens. The aquarium should be set up to mimic these natural conditions as closely as possible, with gentle water movement and dense planting/plenty of shady hiding places. Ideally the substrate will consist of soft sand in order to protect the delicate sensory barbels. Rosy Loaches can be sensitive when first imported, so ensure that the tank is biologically mature. This species is highly sociable and should be kept in large groups (10+). Tankmates should also be of a small size and peaceful nature. When this species was first imported during 2006, it was traded under the fictitious name 'Tuberoschistura arakanensis', and later erroneously as Yunnanilus sp.

Be sure to provide the fish with plenty of hiding places (rocks, bogwood, robust planting) as well as open water areas.

These shoaling fish tend to inhabit heavily vegetated areas of sluggish tributaries, where they stay close to the safety of plant cover and submerged roots. The water is soft and acidic, and is often stained a tea-colour due to tannins released from submerged wood and decaying leaves. Ideally, the aquarium should be darkly furnished, with plenty of bogwood and areas of dense planting to emulate this habitat as closely as possible. Whilst the Rosy Tetra is an adaptable species that will acclimatise to a wide range of conditions, this species will always look its best in soft, acidic water (peat filtration suggested) and the tank must be biologically mature. Rosy Tetras should always be maintained in good sized groups: 6 would be the minimum recommended, 10+ would be better. Not only will the fish feel more secure, but this will result in a far more effective, natural-looking shoal. Ideally, tankmates will also be small and peaceful, and could include Corydoras catfish, hatchetfish, small dwarf cichlids such as Apistogramma or Mikrogeophagus, and some of the smaller Loricariidae (suckermouth catfish). Rosy Tetras can be quite easily frightened, so ensure that they are not housed with boisterous species. This species is very similar to many others in the same genus, some of which remain undescribed. The most commonly seen of these is the Ornate Tetra (H. bentosi). H. rosaceus was, for a long time, considered to be a subspecies of H. bentosi due to their incredible similarity.

As we've seen with other amazonian fishes, a wide distribution often turns out to be a number of undescribed species and this certainly seems to be the case with a variety of L numbers and subspecies known. In all locations, this fish is generally associated with waterlogged wood and its spoon-shaped teeth enable it to process large volumes of material, turning bogwood into sawdust which needs good filtration to remove. It's likely that this xylophage is feeding on the invertebrate microfauna within the wood and it's wise to offer a variety of different bogwood types to aid gut health. This secretive species grows to a substantial size and will require a spacious, mature aquarium with neutral to slightly soft and acidic water. Provide dim lighting, a dark substrate, and an abundance of shady retreats amongst bogwood and sturdy rocky caves, ensuring all decor is secure as larger specimens can be a little clumsy at times. Unfortunately, most plants will be eaten - even relatively hardy species - although some aquarists have success cultivating Java Fern, which reportedly has a bitter taste. Filtration should be efficient (adult fish produce a substantial amount of waste, especially when grazing on bogwood) with areas of brisk water movement along with some quieter resting spots out of the current. There should be a decent level of oxygenation, and small frequent partial water changes will help keep nitrate to a minimum. The Royal Plec is generally peaceful and mixes well with most community fish, although it can be rather territorial with its own kind and similarly sized Loricariid species. If more than one specimen is to be kept in the same tank, it must be very spacious with the provision of multiple hiding places/visual barriers. May also be seen on sale as the Royal Panaque.",
        "feeding": "As all Panaque species feed on wood, it is essential that the aquarium contains some bogwood. Small specimens will also enjoy leaves such as Catappa. Offer a variety of different foodstuffs containing a good proportion of vegetable matter, including a quality dried food to ensure vitamin deficiences are avoided. Courgette, cucumber, lettuce, potato, pumpkin, squash, spinach, sweet potato etc should all be enthusiastically consumed, and these can be supplemented with the odd treat of frozen foods such as bloodworm and chopped prawns. These fish have a very long digestive tract which is utilised in the breaking down of foods high in vegetable content, so do not offer an excessive amount of meaty foods as this will lead to health problems.",
        "breeding": "There are one or two claims that this species has been bred in the home aquarium, but these have never really been substantiated in any detail.

        "care": "The Red Onion Snail is known from freshwater lagoons, streams, and mangrove swamps in Indonesia. These charming gastropods, with their eye-catching red/amber and black dotted shell, are proving to be a popular choice of algae-eating Nerite snail for the aquarist. The aquarium should be mature and spacious, with various algae growths for the snails to enjoy browsing upon. Healthy vegetation will be left alone, so these snails are a good choice for planted aquaria. As these snails feed almost exclusively on algae, their diet will need to be supplemented with algae wafers - as the natural algae in the tank may not be enough to sustain them, and will rapidly diminish. Red Onion Snails consume various types of algae from all over the decor and will keep the glass viewing panes spotless, even tackling some of the really hard encrusting green algae (sometimes known as green spot algae). They will remove algae from robust plants, without damaging the plants themselves; however as these are one of the larger varieties of Nerite snail, they may simply be too heavy to clean very small leaves. Water quality is important for the continual wellbeing of these snails, so ensure the aquarium is well-filtered and undergoes a regular partial water change regime. Hard, alkaline water (or even lightly brackish water) is preferred in order for their protective shells to remain hard. If they are kept in more acidic conditions, the shell will start to dissolve and deteriorate, eventually resulting in the death of the snail. Tankmates should be peaceful and enjoy the same water conditions e.g small tetras, rainbowfish, honey gouramis, guppies/Endler's livebearers, Caridina/Neocaridina shrimps etc. Avoid keeping with loaches, puffers, large/aggressive cichlids, and any vigorous substrate diggers which may accidentally upturn them. It is best to keep these snails in well-covered aquaria, as they will climb above the water line and may fully escape the tank if there are any gaps. As they cope with tidal waters in some locations in the wild, they are able to survive out of water for a short time. The only downside with these beautiful snails is that they are unable to breed in freshwater conditions - although this may actually be a blessing to some as they will not over-populate the tank in the same way some 'pest' snail species can. Nevertheless, they often deposit their small white eggs over the decor, but these will not hatch in freshwater (see breeding section, below). May also be seen on sale as Neritina sp. 'tracked' or Orange Track Nerite Snail.",
        "feeding": "In the wild, Red Onion Snails feed mainly on various types of algae and vegetable matter. A mature aquarium will help to provide some natural greenfoods, but the diet must be supplemented with algae wafers and Spirulina tablets, along with vegetable matter such as cucumber and blanched spinach. Avoid too many protein rich foods.",
        "breeding": "Breeding Red Onion Snails is rather involved due to the fact that the eggs, once hatched, require full marine conditions to develop through their complex larval stages. Although these gastropods often lay large numbers of small, white calciferous capsules (each containing an egg) in freshwater aquaria, these will not always hatch, and if they do, the larvae will not survive for very long. The best way to go about breeding these snails is to set up a small, dedicated hatching aquarium with full marine conditions (SG ~1.024), using the type of salt used in marine fishkeeping. The adult snails will not cope with full marine conditions, so do not attempt to adjust the salinity of their tank water too much (lightly brackish, SG 1.005-1.010 is ok, but no higher). Within the hatching tank that has been adjusted to marine conditions, some crushed coral or aragonite added to the substrate or placed in the filter (a simple gentle air powered filter is sufficient) will help to keep the water hard and alkaline. In the meantime, the water temperature in the main aquarium housing the adult snails should be set at the top of their preferred range (i.e. 26 \u00b0C) as this will encourage breeding, as will offering the snails plenty of choice in greenfoods. Once eggs have been laid, usually on hard decor, they should be acclimatised very, very gradually to the tank with full marine conditions (ideally the item the eggs have been laid on will be moveable). Drip acclimatisation is best over several hours - place the decor with eggs into a small poly box filled with water from the original tank, and slowly drip in marine water from the hatching tank using narrow tubing. The eggs should be moved into these conditions within 3 days of being laid or else they will not be viable. In the wild, the snail eggs/larvae are swept downriver, into the estuaries, and then out to sea, where they feed on plankton whilst undergoing several major developmental changes, before coming back to freshwater as fully developed snails. By replicating these salty conditions in the aquarium, the young are able to successfully undergo these changes as they would in the wild; additionally it is thought that calcium and other minerals more readily available to them in seawater aid in developing a strong shell. In the home aquarium, the eggs will take approximately 2-3 weeks to hatch; any infertile eggs disintegrating after 2 or 3 days. Eggs that are fertile will become darker over the next few days as the veliger (planktonic larva) develops within the capsule. Once free-swimming, the veligers will move towards any light source, and most successful breeding reports suggest to keep illumination to a minimum. Feeding is extremely challenging, and it can be very difficult to get the young past this veliger stage, which typically lasts around 21 days, as they transform through different planktonic stages. Having aged pieces of decor in the tank with mature algae growth would be very advantageous, as would adding small quantities of aged green water each day. Once the young snails have developed obvious shiny shells, they can be acclimatised back to freshwater very, very, slowly over the course of a few weeks.",

Few details are known of the natural habitat, but the favoured environments are thought to be sluggish or almost still, and crowded with dense vegetation and an abundance of leaf litter. The water is very soft and acidic, and stained a tea colour from the tannins in the decaying leaves and wood. The home aquarium should be mature, with a dark substrate and background and with driftwood and plenty of plant cover - both rooted and floating - in order for these peaceful fish to feel secure. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement gentle. Ruby Tetras are gregarious but not tightly schooling, and are best maintained in groups of at least 10, and more than this wherever possible. Male fish tend to hold small territories and may bicker a little on occasion, but providing there is a good network of hiding places/visual barriers for them to retreat into if necessary, no real harm should ensue. Tankmates, if desired, must also be small and peaceful. Good companions could include smaller species of Corydoras catfish, Otocinclus spp., dwarf cichlids, pencilfish, and other small blackwater tetras. If unfussy about creating an exact biotope, some of the smaller Rasbora and Boraras species from Asia would get along well with the tetras, as would Kuhli loaches (Pangio spp.). Acclimatisation should be carried out very carefully, and be sure to keep up with small regular water changes to keep nitrogenous wastes at a minimum, as these fish are very sensitive to deteriorating water conditions. In the wild, the Ruby Tetra has an all-over intense red colouration which diminishes somewhat in captivity - but the exact reason for this is unclear.",

When in condition, these fish spawn on a daily basis, so leave the adults in the spawning aquarium for a few days before acclimatising them back to the main aquarium - this way they will not get too much of a chance to prey on the eggs and young.

When kept in more alkaline conditions, parameters such as nitrate become more problematic and may cause a significant loss of colour as a first symptom of stress. As with many blackwater species, the higher background bacterial populations in hard, alkaline water may be challenging for them, making good maintenance and hygiene very important.\nFound alongside species such as stingrays and cardinals in the wild, these tetras are extremely peaceful and can be housed with a wide range of fishes that enjoy the same conditions. They are particularly striking when kept as a shoal of twenty or more and mix well with discus in large aquaria.\nAs the most widely kept and bred of the three rummynose species, a number of aquarium forms have been produced, including a platinum form with increased iridescence, an albino and a golden xanthic strain.

        "care": "The Ryukin is a selectively bred high-backed, double-tailed strain of the common Goldfish. Fancy goldfish have long been popular aquarium pets, and are often the aquarists first venture into keeping aquarium fish. Given appropriate housing and care, these beautiful fish can attain quite a size and live for 15-20 years. The aquarium should be spacious with a large area for oxygen exchange; the length and width of the tank are much more important than the height in this respect. Fancy goldfish grow quickly so it is best to provide them with the largest aquarium that you can from the outset. Not only will this help to avoid stunting (and the associated health problems this can bring) but it will also provide a much safer, more stable environment for them. The larger the volume of water, the more stable it will be in terms of water chemistry and temperature. Fancy goldfish are notoriously messy fish; they are voracious eaters and continually stir up the substrate in their ongoing search for food - and such considerable amounts of waste can lead to water quality issues in smaller aquaria if not monitored very closely. The larger the aquarium, the better. Efficient filtration is essential, and regular partial water changes are advised in order to keep nitrate to a minimum. The water should be well-oxygenated (of particular importance during warmer spells of weather) and this is easily achieved by the use of spray-bar returns from filters, air pumps, small powerheads with flow diverter angled towards the water's surface etc, and may be aided further by the incorporation of oxygenating aquatic plants, which the fish will also enjoy nibbling at. Various species of coolwater tolerant plants can be added to the aquarium, but these will likely require periodic replacement due to them being uprooted/eaten - something most goldfish keepers accept and allow their fish to take pleasure in. The substrate can consist of rounded gravel or sand, and decor can include smooth rocks and ornaments with no sharp edges. Ryukin are sociable creatures and should be kept in groups, either with their own kind or with other varieties of fancy goldfish. It is best, however, to avoid keeping the standard 'single-tailed' common goldfish alongside the fancy varieties, as the common goldfish is a faster swimmer and may outcompete the fancies at feeding time. Several colour varieties of Ryukin are available, including red, red and white, and calico.",

        "breeding": "Well-conditioned fancy goldfish will spawn in the home aquarium. Female fish will be noticeably rounder bellied when full of eggs, and the male fish will develop tubercles (tiny raised bumps) on the gill plates and pectoral fins. A large, slightly cooler water change is often enough to trigger ready pairs into spawning. As the temperature slowly rises back up to its usual level, the male will pursue the female around the aquarium, but generally in a non-aggressive manner. This courtship ritual may last more than a day before spawning commences, and the colours of the fish often intensify at this time. The male fish will nudge the female into the fine-leaved plants (or spawning mops), where she will then scatter eggs which the male simultaneously fertilises. Spawning can last for a number of hours, and several thousand adhesive eggs may be scattered over the plants/spawning mop. The adults will be hungry and will start to devour as many eggs as they can find, so are best moved to another aquarium. The eggs take 4-5 days to hatch, depending on water temperature. Young fancy goldfish are often brown in colour (like their ancestors) and it can take up to a year before full colouration becomes apparent.",

Due to its diminutive adult size, it is not suitable for the general community aquarium as it may be intimidated by or preyed upon by larger tankmates. A small, mature, densely planted tank would be perfect for this pretty, shoaling catfish. There should be a sandy substrate in order to protect the delicate sensory barbels, and some shady hiding spots amongst driftwood and broad leaved plants. Floating plants can also be useful in helping to diffuse bright lighting. Peat filtration will help to keep the water soft and acidic, and the tannins released will result in the fish showing their best colours. Filtration should be efficient, but water movement very gentle. Salt & Pepper Corys should always be maintained in large sized groups of at least 10 specimens; this will not only give them more confidence, but will result in a more effective, natural-looking shoal. Other tankmates could include tiny sized characins such as Ember Tetras, micro Rasboras (Boraras spp.), or small ornamental shrimps such as Red Crystals or Cherries. Frequent partial water changes are a must, as these fish can be very sensitive to elevated nitrate levels. Corydoras have the ability to breathe air intestinally, so a small gap should be left between the surface of the water and the cover slides in order for the fish to come up to the surface and take air in. It may do this numerous times per day.\nHoplisoma was recently split from Corydoras and contains many familiar species.",

Filtration should be efficient with a decent level of oxygenation and areas of fast water movement, along with some quieter resting spots out of the current.

Salvini Cichlids are considered very aggressive, and when breeding they will become even more territorial. They are best maintained as a compatible pair.

        "breeding": "Substrate spawner. When ready to spawn, the fish will intensify in colour quite dramatically and display to one another. They will then choose a preferred spawning site at one of the caves or a flat piece of rock, digging small pits nearby. Whilst the female is busy cleaning the spawning site, the male patrols the perimeter, ready to defend against any intruders that may, or may not, be present. When ready, the female will swim over the spawning site in a series of \"dry runs\", after which she will begin depositing between 500-600 eggs. The male immediately follows behind her and fertilises them. The act of spawning has been known to continue for well over an hour in some cases, after which time, the female will start hovering above the eggs, fanning them with her pectoral fins. The male resumes his sentry duty, guarding the perimeter once more. It is at this time that Salvini Cichlids are at their most aggressive, which is why, if you have a pair in a relatively small aquarium, they are best kept by themselves. However, if kept in a larger \"mixed community\" type setting, other fish usually cotton-on pretty quickly that it's best to stay well away from the protective parents. After 3 or 4 days, the eggs should hatch into wrigglers, and the parents will move them into one of their prepared pits. The wrigglers will initially feed on their yolk sacs, and should become free swimming after another 4 or 5 more days. Baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii), microworms, or egg layer \"first foods\" should be offered at this stage, followed by crushed flake after a week or so. The parents will continue to herd them from pit to pit until they are ready to make their own way. Well fed adults do not usually prey on their young. With such a large potential brood size, you should think about methods of re-homing the young once they have attained a satisfactory size. Salvini Cichlids mature at what seems like a very young age, and before you know it, you could have multiple pairs trying to form.",

Regular maintenance, including frequent partial water changes, should be carried out in order to keep these fish in good condition. Provide plenty of shady areas amongst driftwood, rocks, and hardy plant species that can cope with moderate current.

Good specimens are a match for koi and it's apparent that these handsome fish compliment other forms such as shubunkins and yellow goldfish beautifully. All goldfish should be kept in groups but these can consist of a mixture of varieties - just make sure that female fish aren't outnumbered by the more long-finned and lightly-built males, which chase them relentlessly during spawning.\nLike all hardy goldfish breeds, these are a great choice for the garden pond. Hardy and long-lived, they'll happily live amongst pond plants and don't place too much of a burden on filtration, even as mature fish. Not only do their colours complement other varieties but they'll freely interbreed, with fry showing the typical goldfish dark colouration that protects them from predators until they grow large enough to look after themselves.\nIn their long history as pets, it's become common practice to keep goldfish indoors in containers that are much too small for them. As you can imagine, housing a 30cm pond fish in a bowl is not ideal and a suitable indoor aquarium should be at least 100 litres in capacity and well-filtered for young specimens. Far better alternatives are available for indoor keeping and tropical fish are far easier and a good deal less work. If your heart is set on goldfish as a pet, consider starting with small fish in a large aquarium which can then be upgraded to a spacious pond as they grow - obviously, this is only an option with pond-hardy varieties.\nGoldfish are hardy and adaptable fishes, but they prefer hard water and whether indoors or out and soft, acidic conditions are to be avoided. To minimise the stresses of cold winter weather and hot summer days, a fishpond should be at least 60cm (2') deep in places.

In larger ponds, keeping fish that will consume the goldfish eggs - such as orfe - is a natural way of keeping the population in check. Goldfish lay their eggs amongst aquatic vegetation (or on artificial spawning mops) and these usually hatch within 48-72 hours depending on water temperature. Young goldfish are brown in colour (like their ancestors) and it can take up to a year before brighter colouration becomes apparent.

The aquarium that houses this energetic species should be at least 4ft long, with a good amount of filtration, water movement and oxygenation. The best choice of substrate would be coral sand or aragonite, which will help to keep the water hard and alkaline. Rocks should be used to create small outcrops, caves, and steeply sloping walls, ensuring that there are ample visual barriers, but do also leave generous expanses of sand. Hardy plants could also be incorporated into the aquascape if desired. C. leptostoma are generally peaceful but slightly skittish in the confines of the home aquarium, so large sized shoals of 15 or more will help them to feel more secure. These cichlids are best maintained in a species-only aquarium, but, in larger quarters, can be kept as part of a Tanganyikan community with fish of similar size and peaceful temperament (they should not be kept with belligerent species, otherwise they may stop feeding and the males will lose colour). Ideally, there will be a small number of males, outnumbered greatly by females. Having more than one male will help to ensure the fish display their best colours as they vie for female attention, and it should be noted that even subdominant males tend to show good colouration. The males may show a degree of territorial aggression towards one another, but a very spacious tank with a large sized group consisting of mainly females, this should not become a serious issue. Sardine Cichlids are intolerant of poor water conditions, so ensure small partial water changes are carried out on a frequent basis. Ensure the tank is well covered, as these fish are expert jumpers. Several geographical colour variants of this species are known: 'Ikola', 'Karilani', 'Kigoma', 'Mpulungu', and 'Utinta/Malasa', and interestingly all of these variants exist with populations of both blue tailed and yellow tailed males.",

        "breeding": "Maternal mouthbrooder. Interestingly, male fish stake out virtual spawning territories located 3-dimensionally in the water column. The male fish will allow other fish to pass through his territory, only chasing away rival males, but should a ripe female approach, he will display to her. If receptive, she will follow him into the middle of his territory, with spawning then occurring in midwater. The male flaps his ventral fins (each tipped with a growth loosely resembling an egg) in a vigorous manner, triggering the female into mouthing at his vent, which in turn causes the male to release his milt, and this is then taken up into the mouth of the female. The female then assumes a head down position whilst the male mouths at her, instigating the release of a single egg. The female then quickly reverses so that she can catch the egg in her mouth, which mixes with the milt. She will catch a small succession of eggs in this same manner before the male returns, and the process is repeated until the female is spent of eggs. The female will carry the brood of up to 20 eggs in her mouth for 3-4 weeks before releasing the free-swimming fry. She will not eat during this time. When the fry are released, they will be large enough to take baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) and crushed flake. The young are left to fend for themselves, but in a species-only environment, the adult Sardine Cichlids do not tend to predate upon them. The fry will even school together, eventually joining the adult group when they reach approximately 2.5cm (1\") in length.",

D\u00c3\u00a9cor such as ocean rock can be used to build sturdy structures which stretch from the base of the tank to near the surface of the water.

Although a substrate of coral sand or Aragonite is often recommended to help to keep the water hard and alkaline, Mbuna feel safer and show better colours over a darker substrate. The Aragonite or coral sand can always be placed into a mesh bag and kept inside the external filter for buffering purposes. Most rock-dwelling species are extremely aggressive and need to be kept under conditions of 'controlled-overcrowding' to prevent territorial disputes ending fatally - additional filtration may also be required to cope with a heavy bioload. This species can be kept successfully alongside other Mbuna, although it is best to avoid fish with a similar colour pattern.\nThe 'Coral Red' form is frequently seen and is distinctive for its bright orange females. Although presented as a line-bred form, there is a possibility that this is a hybrid and should not be housed together with normal saulosi.",
        "feeding": "The diet should be primarily vegetarian. Foods rich in animal protein could cause Malawi Bloat, which can be fatal. A good quality Spirulina-based green flake should be mixed with a standard quality flake food, and offered along with appropriately sized granular foods specifically developed for Mbuna.

Vegetable matter such as cucumber, blanched spinach and romaine lettuce can be fed on a regular basis.",
        "breeding": "When ready to spawn, the colouration of the male will intensify and his aggression level will heighten. He will choose and clean a spawning site, then display to the female fish until one accepts him. They will circle each other in a head to tail manner a number of times, until the female deposits her eggs. These are deposited just one or two at a time and after doing so, she immediately turns around and picks them up. At the same time, the male will rotate so that he is almost on his side, at the same time shaking and extending his anal fin, releasing his milt. The female sees the egg spots on the male\"\u2122s anal fin and attempts to pick up those \"\u0153eggs\"\u009d whilst she is picking up the real ones that she deposited, and at the same time taking in milt. This is the method of fertilisation, and this ritual may go on for some hours. The eggs may be incubated for up to 25 days until they hatch and the resultant fry held for a further few days afterwards. It is not unusual for a mouthbrooding female to adopt the blue/black male colouration, perhaps to ward off other fish whilst holding or when about to release the young.",

The tank must be mature and have myriad of hiding places amongst driftwood and thick vegetation, which should include floating species to help diffuse the light. Indian Almond Leaves (Terminalia catappa) are also very much appreciated as 'leaf litter', but these must be replaced on a regular basis as they gradually decompose. Filtration should be good but water movement gentle. Scarlet Badis should be maintained in pairs, or in a harem situation with one male and several females. Rival males can be rather aggressive towards one another, especially in smaller aquaria. However, if the tank is more spacious (and heavily planted as detailed above) then it may be possible to keep more than one male, as there should be ample visual barriers and room for each male to establish his own territory. Tankmates, if desired, should be small and peaceful e.g. Boraras spp., Danionella spp., Paedocypris progenetica, Pangio spp., Pseudomugil spp., pygmy Corydoras etc. Much attention must be paid to water quality since Scarlet Badis are somewhat delicate and do not tolerate elevated nitrates or swings in water chemistry.

The male immediately fertilises the eggs and then drives away the female, caring for the eggs himself. The eggs should hatch within 2-3 days, but it may be up to a week before the fry have finished absorbing their yolk sacs and become free-swimming. The fry are tiny and initially require miniscule foodstuffs such as infusoria, until they are large enough to accept baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) or microworm. The adult fish will predate on the fry, although some should make it to adulthood in densely planted set-ups.

It is not gregarious and may be found hiding underneath rocks, emerging to feed on small invertebrates. The aquarium housing this substantial species must be of vast proportions with powerful, oversized filtration to match. The substrate should consist of soft sand or smooth rounded gravel with huge pieces of bogwood arranged to create a number of shady caves and crevices. Rockwork can also be provided, but you must ensure this is heavy enough and stable enough not to be disturbed by the movement of this big catfish. There should be brisk water movement and a high level of oxygenation, perhaps provided by powerheads (in addition to the current generated by the filtration). Dim lighting is preferable, but this can be brighter if diffused by the decor. It is best to keep only one Scarlet Plec per tank, as these fish can be fiercely territorial with conspecifics and other bottom dwellers that occupy the same niche.

This is a peaceful shoaling species, ideal for mature softwater aquaria. The tank should be furnished with plenty of driftwood to create lots of shady areas, and the tannins that are gradually released from the wood should help to acidify the water whilst giving it a natural, clear tea-colour. Peat filtration can also help in this respect. Although plants are not found in abundance in the natural waters of this species, a moderate amount of planting will be appreciated and will help to make the fish feel more secure. Lighting should not be too bright (tannins and floating plants can help to diffuse brighter lighting), and darker substrate and background choices will help to show off their exquisite colours. Scarlet Tetras should always be maintained in good sized groups, 6 would be the minimum recommended, 10+ would be better. Not only will the fish feel more secure, but this will result in a far more effective, natural-looking shoal. Tankmates should also be small and peaceful, as these fish are easily intimidated by larger or more rowdy species.

However if you wish to raise a good number of fry, a small separate breeding aquarium should be set up for the purpose. This tank should also contain soft, acidic water, and the temperature should be set towards the high end of their preferred range. Prior to the spawning attempt, condition your fish on plenty of small meaty live or frozen foods. Clumps of Java moss or a few bunches of fine-leaved plants should be added to the breeding tank to give the fish somewhere to scatter their eggs, and very gentle filtration should be provided via an air-driven sponge filter. No dedicated lighting should be used, as eggs and fry tend to be light sensitive. Acclimatise a mix of both sexes across to the new tank very carefully during the evening, and in the morning, when sunlight hits the tank, spawning should commence. The parents should be removed immediately after spawning ceases as they will predate on the eggs. Some aquarists like to use a fine mesh in the tank so that the scattered eggs can fall to safety, away from the attention of the adult fish. Ideally try and keep the tank in darkness once eggs have been scattered, to protect them and the resultant sensitive young fry from being damaged by bright light. The eggs should hatch within 24-36 hours (temperature dependent) and the young will initially feed from their yolk sacs for a short time.

        "care": "The Senegal Bichir has a widespread distribution throughout much of tropical Africa, where it inhabits sheltered freshwater lagoons, marshes, and swamps with dense vegetation and muddy substrates. This solitary nocturnal predator tends to seek refuge in dimly lit, sheltered nooks and crannies during the day, emerging at night to feed on crustaceans, insects, insect larvae, molluscs, small fish and small frogs. An aquarium that houses this species should be spacious - ideally at least 6ft x 2ft x 2ft for adult specimens - and very well covered, as these fish are great escape artists. Ensure that any gaps where wires feed in to the aquarium are plugged securely with filter foam or mesh glued into place. The lid of the aquarium may also need to be weighted down. Senegal Bichirs have the ability to breathe atmospheric air via their modified swim bladders (part of which functions as an accessory breathing organ to allow them to survive out of water for a time), so a small gap MUST be left between the surface of the water and the cover slides in order for the fish to come up to the surface and take air in. If the fish are denied regular access to air above the surface of the water, they may actually drown, so always run the tank with a dropped waterline. The substrate should consist of soft sand as these fish spend a lot of time foraging about on the bottom of the tank. Smooth water worn rocks and spindly driftwood can be used to create shady caves and there should be areas of dense planting with tall, hardy species such as Vallisneria and large Anubias or Aponogeton spp. Illumination should not be too bright, or if it is, it should be diffused via heavy planting. A blue moon light timed to come on just before the main lights switch off will allow you to view the night-time antics of these fascinating fish. The water should be filtered efficiently but with a gentle output, so that the fish do not have to contend with an overwhelming current. The Polypterus genus is closely related to the monotypic Erpetoichthys genus (Reed Fish), both of which are considered to be the last surviving relatives of some very ancient, primitive species. As their eyesight is quite poor, Senegal Bichirs rely on their excellent sense of smell in order to locate food items, and although carnivorous by nature, they are generally very peaceful, and can be kept successfully alongside other medium sized peaceable species. Avoid any tankmates which are small enough to fit into their mouths, as they will be predated upon overnight. Good companions could include some of the medium sized, relatively peaceful cichlid species such as Angelfish, Severums or Festivums, large Trichogaster gouramis, knife fish, other Polypterus spp., or Synodontis catfish. Avoid any really boisterous species though, as otherwise they may outcompete your Senegal Bichir at feeding times. Senegal Bichirs can be kept in groups in voluminous aquaria, but ensure that all specimens are of similar size and that there is a plethora of hiding places (allow several per fish) so they can form individual territories. Be aware that although Senegal Bichirs are considered quite hardy and will acclimatise to a wide range of conditions, they do not handle swings in pH well at all. Likewise, nitrates should not be allowed to creep up, so ensure that small partial water changes are carried out on a regular basis. This species is recommended for advanced aquarists only. May also be seen on sale as the Grey Bichir or Swamp Dragon. An albino strain is now widely seen.",
        "feeding": "These carnivores rarely take dried foods in captivity, so you must be prepared to offer them various meaty frozen foods. Smaller specimens will enjoy bloodworm, white mosquito larvae, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp etc. whereas larger specimens will take bigger foods such as Mysis shrimp, chopped krill/prawns/mussels, earthworms etc. Occasional specimens have been known to take sinking carnivore pellets (pre-soaked in aquarium water to prevent choking \"\u201c Bichirs are notorious for gulping food down), but this is not the norm. Always try and feed just before lights out, as this is when these fish are naturally most active.",
        "breeding": "Challenging - this species has been bred in the aquarium, but very infrequently, and with few details available. It would make an excellent breeding project for the serious, dedicated hobbyist. In the wild, Senegal Bichirs breed during the rainy season, so simulating a seasonal change with large, cool water changes, and an increase in current may help to trigger breeding. During courtship, the male and female swim parallel to one another, in a graceful fashion, usually through clumps of plants, and they may even jump clear of the water's surface repeatedly before descending again. The male will make jerking sideways movements with his head, towards the female\"\u2122s body. If she is ready to spawn, she will stop swimming and the male will wrap his anal fin around her genital opening. Both fish will remain motionless whilst a few eggs are deposited in a cup formed by the male\"\u2122s anal fin, and there they will be fertilised before being dispersed by powerful movements of his tail. The eggs are adhesive and will stick to the plants. This procedure is repeated many times until the female is spent of eggs (usually 200-450). The adults exhibit no parental care. The eggs should hatch after approximately 3-4 days, but remain attached to the vegetation whilst the fry absorb their yolk sacs. A few days later they will begin feeding and should be offered baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii). At this stage they have external gills with many branches and resemble salamander larvae (these external gills are lost as the fish grows).",

Unfortunately, it can be a little prone to barbel infections/erosion, so it is of paramount importance that the fish are kept on a soft sand substrate (rather than gravel where waste can build up unseen) in order to protect these delicate sensory organs. Regular maintenance, including frequent partial water changes, should be carried out in order to keep these fish in good condition. Provide plenty of shady areas amongst driftwood, rocks, and areas of dense planting. Other peaceful species such as some of the smaller pencilfish, tetra, and rasboras make ideal tankmates, and their presence as dither fish in midwater will encourage the Corys out into view more often. Corydoras have the ability to breath air intestinally, so a small gap should be left between the surface of the water and the cover slides in order for the fish to come up to the surface and take air in.

        "care": "The Ryukin is a selectively bred high-backed, double-tailed strain of the common Goldfish. Fancy goldfish have long been popular aquarium pets, and are often the aquarists first venture into keeping aquarium fish. Given appropriate housing and care, these beautiful fish can attain quite a size and live for 15-20 years. The aquarium should be spacious with a large area for oxygen exchange; the length and width of the tank are much more important than the height in this respect. Fancy goldfish grow quickly so it is best to provide them with the largest aquarium that you can from the outset. Not only will this help to avoid stunting (and the associated health problems this can bring) but it will also provide a much safer, more stable environment for them. The larger the volume of water, the more stable it will be in terms of water chemistry and temperature. Fancy goldfish are notoriously messy fish; they are voracious eaters and continually stir up the substrate in their ongoing search for food - and such considerable amounts of waste can lead to water quality issues in smaller aquaria if not monitored very closely. The larger the aquarium, the better. Efficient filtration is essential, and regular partial water changes are advised in order to keep nitrate to a minimum. The water should be well-oxygenated (of particular importance during warmer spells of weather) and this is easily achieved by the use of spray-bar returns from filters, air pumps, small powerheads with flow diverter angled towards the water's surface etc, and may be aided further by the incorporation of oxygenating aquatic plants, which the fish will also enjoy nibbling at. Various species of coolwater tolerant plants can be added to the aquarium, but these will likely require periodic replacement due to them being uprooted/eaten - something most goldfish keepers accept and allow their fish to take pleasure in. The substrate can consist of rounded gravel or sand, and decor can include smooth rocks and ornaments with no sharp edges. Ryukin are sociable creatures and should be kept in groups, either with their own kind or with other varieties of fancy goldfish. It is best, however, to avoid keeping the standard 'single-tailed' common goldfish alongside the fancy varieties, as the common goldfish is a faster swimmer and may outcompete the fancies at feeding time.\nSeveral colour varieties of Shortfin Ryukin are available, including red, red and white, and calico.",

        "breeding": "Well-conditioned fancy goldfish will spawn in the home aquarium. Female fish will be noticeably rounder bellied when full of eggs, and the male fish will develop tubercles (tiny raised bumps) on the gill plates and pectoral fins. A large, slightly cooler water change is often enough to trigger ready pairs into spawning. As the temperature slowly rises back up to its usual level, the male will pursue the female around the aquarium, but generally in a non-aggressive manner. This courtship ritual may last more than a day before spawning commences, and the colours of the fish often intensify at this time. The male fish will nudge the female into the fine-leaved plants (or spawning mops), where she will then scatter eggs which the male simultaneously fertilises. Spawning can last for a number of hours, and several thousand adhesive eggs may be scattered over the plants/spawning mop. The adults will be hungry and will start to devour as many eggs as they can find, so are best moved to another aquarium. The eggs take 4-5 days to hatch, depending on water temperature. Young fancy goldfish are often brown in colour (like their ancestors) and it can take up to a year before full colouration becomes apparent.",

        "care": "The Shovelnose Catfish is a widespread species known from numerous river basins, including the Amazon, Orinoco, Parana, and Parnaiba. This is a large species that can live for over a decade, and requires a very spacious aquarium accompanied by powerful filtration and a decent level of oxygenation. Young specimens grow very quickly, so it is vital that they are provided with vast quarters from the outset, in order to prevent stunting and associated health problems. The footprint of the tank (length and width) is much more important than the height, so always aim for a tank as long and wide as possible. These fish are voracious eaters and therefore produce a lot of nitrogenous waste, so it is essential to run powerful filtration on the aquarium - ideally with 2 or more canister filters, so that if one should fail or requires maintenance, there is back up. Frequent, partial water changes are an absolute must in order to keep the nitrate level as low as possible. There should be areas of brisk water movement, coupled with calmer areas, and a balance of shady caves and ample swimming space along the front of the aquarium. Provide a soft sandy substrate in order to protect the long sensory barbels, which the catfish uses to grub about for food items. Robust plants should not be eaten, but they will be quickly and vigorously uprooted as the catfish noses about in the substrate, so most aquarists opt to omit them from the aquascape. Lighting should not be too bright, and a blue moon light turned on just before the main lights switch off will allow you to observe the antics of these fascinating fish for a time during the late evening. Tankmates, if desired, must be chosen very carefully as although the Shovelnose Catfish is generally peaceful, it is predatory and has quite a capacious mouth capable of consuming sizeable prey. Good tankmates could include Distichodus spp., adult silver dollars, knifefish, hefty barbs, and big Loricariids (suckermouth catfish). Avoid keeping with other Pimelodids (long-whiskered catfish). Juvenile Shovelnoses are quite gregarious and can be maintained together, but territorial aggression increases with age and they will likely need separating unless the tank is voluminous and there are adequate hiding places/visual barriers.

        "care": "First developed over 200 years ago, Shubunkin have a long pedigree as pet fish. Their colouration - calico, was inherited from fancy goldfish that were crossed with single-tailed goldfish to give the best of both forms. Their mixture of blue, red and black pigments is made possible thanks to the non-reflective scales of these fish and this trait often gives them a pink blush to the gill covers. 'Shubs' are the perfect alternative to koi for the average garden pond and these brightly coloured fish compliment other goldfish breeds such as sarasa comets and canary yellow goldfish beautifully. Goldfish should be kept in groups but these can consist of a mixture of varieties - just make sure that female fish aren't outnumbered by the more long-finned and lightly-built males, which chase them relentlessly during spawning.\nLike all hardy goldfish breeds, these are a great choice for the garden pond. Hardy and long-lived, they'll happily live amongst pond plants and don\"\u2122t place too much of a burden on filtration, even as mature fish. Not only do their colours complement other varieties but they\"\u2122ll freely interbreed, with fry often showing the typical goldfish dark colouration that protects them from predators until they grow large enough to look after themselves.\nIn their long history as pets, it's become common practice to keep goldfish indoors in containers that are much too small for them. As you can imagine, housing a 30cm pond fish in a bowl is not ideal and a suitable indoor aquarium should be at least 100 litres in capacity and well-filtered for young specimens. Far better alternatives are available for indoor keeping and tropical fish are far easier and a good deal less work. If your heart is set on goldfish as a pet, consider starting with small fish in a large aquarium which can then be upgraded to a spacious pond as they grow \"\u201c obviously, this is only an option with pond-hardy varieties.\nGoldfish are hardy and adaptable fishes, but they prefer hard water and whether indoors or out and soft, acidic conditions are to be avoided. To minimise the stresses of cold winter weather and hot summer days, a fishpond should be at least 60cm (2\") deep in places. During the coldest weather, this area should remain undisturbed by vigorous water circulation and will be used as a refuge from extreme cold.\nCommercially produced shubs may be long or short-finned but within showing circles there are two main fin types. London shubunkins are short-finned and closest to the commonly encountered pond fish and Bristol shubunkins have far more elaborate lobed tails. If in doubt, look at the price - Bristols are rare and harder to produce, although there are fish of this type starting to appear in stores.",

        "breeding": "At temperatures of 15c and above, male goldfish will start to pursue females in a spawning chase, driving them into suitable egg laying sites. Mature goldfish will breed on a regular basis in established ponds so do make occasional checks to ensure that the pond is not becoming overstocked. In larger ponds, keeping fish that will consume the goldfish eggs - such as orfe - is a natural way of keeping the population in check. Goldfish lay their eggs amongst aquatic vegetation (or on artificial spawning mops) and these usually hatch within 48-72 hours depending on water temperature. Young shubunkin are often noticeably pink compared to other goldfish types and develop colour with age. Bristol types will often revert to normal fin types and it may be fewer than 1% of offspring that show the characteristic finnage.",

        "care": "The Siamese algae-eater, also known as the Siamese flying fox or SAE, is, as the name suggests, a fantastic algae-eating addition to moderately sized mature aquaria.\n  This species is best maintained either singly or in groups of 5 or more of its own kind. Smaller sized groups may result in territorial squabbling. Not only do these fish have a striking appearance, but they will enjoy browsing on many types of nuisance algae, including hair or black-brush algae which most other fish will not touch. As detailed below, the diet must be supplemented with other foods including a good vegetable component. The aquarium itself must be long in order to give these active fish adequate swimming space. The tank should have tight fitting coverslides as this species is known to jump. The water should be well-filtered and a good flow rate provided in order to simulate the clear fast-flowing highly-oxygenated streams this fish originates from. Most plants can be kept safely with this species, so the tank can be well planted along the sides and back. If plants do appear to start being eaten then it is likely to be down to one of three things: Firstly, ensure that your fish have been correctly identified. Secondly, make sure that your fish are receiving a good amount of vegetable matter in their diet. And thirdly, check that the plant munching is not being carried out by another species within the same aquarium. Siamese algae-eaters will be seen browsing on the leaves of plants, but this is for algae removal purposes only, and they will not usually consume or damage the leaves themselves. A smooth sand substrate, bogwood and flat stones/cobbles will all help to create that river bed effect. Strong lighting should be used to encourage algae and which will also promote good plant growth. As these fish are of a peaceful disposition, they make great companions for many other fish, such as barbs, Rasboras, loaches, rainbowfish, and some of the larger tetra species. However, it is best to avoid close relatives/similar looking species (discussed below in more detail) and members of the Epalzeorhynchus genus (e.g. Ruby or Red Tailed Black Sharks). It is also worth bearing in mind that their active and sudden darting behaviour may alarm shy or nervous fish species.\n  Species of very similar appearance to the Siamese algae-eater are the Flying Fox (Epalzeorhynchos kalopterus), Crossocheilus atrilimes and Garra cambodgiensis. True Siamese algae-eaters can be distinguished by the slight zigzag appearance of the edges on the horizontal black stripe, which has no golden stripe above it and which extends through the middle of the tail fin. The scales on the dorsal surface can reflect a slight cross-hatched appearance due to the black edging on each scale, and usually the fins are completely colourless (except, of course, for the tail which has the body stripe running through it). One pair of barbels is present, although these are often held flat so are difficult to distinguish. It is not unusual for this species to live for 10-15 years in aquaria. Older aquarium literature often shows erroneous pictures for this species and this may account for much of the historical confusion when used by exporters of these species, with retailers using the names that the fishes were shipped under.",

        "care": "The brilliantly coloured varieties of the Siamese Fighting Fish seen in many shops today have been developed over the years by selective captive breeding. Indeed the natural wild colouration for this species is rather more subtle, with relatively short finnage. Many strains, such as the Longtail, Shortail, Crowntail, Half Moon and Double Tail, and various colour types including red, blue, green, white, golden, black, marble, and many others, have been developed and are now available to the hobbyist. Recently, new forms have been created through hybridisation with closely related species and these are often closer to wild forms in size and morphology. Historically, this seems to have occured before during their domestication. Fighting strains of this species are occasionally seen and differ significantly from their ornamental cousins in terms of body shape and fin proportions, having been bred to exaggerate very different features as well as temperament.\n  Siamese Fighting Fish, although capable of breathing atmospheric air via their labyrinth organ, should always be housed in filtered aquaria. Small vases and bowls are not suitable for long term care. These fish deserve proper stable water conditions and temperatures, as does any fish in our care, and this can only be achieved in a closed system by use of a heater/thermostat, a filter and regular partial water changes.\n  Male Siamese Fighters should never be housed with other males, as fighting will break out immediately. As these attacks can be very violent and stressful to the fish, the loser will invariably end up becoming weakened and if not separated from the other, it is likely to be pursued until it is killed. It is wise, therefore, to take your time to find yourself the male of your choice and keep him as a lone specimen. Females of the species often display slightly more muted colours, a white ovipositor spot and generally possess much shorter finnage. They themselves can also be surprisingly aggressive, and will often be observed threatening one another to establish a dominance heirarchy or defend resources. More than one female can be kept together, although the group must consist of at least 5 individuals. Smaller groups of females will result in the Alpha fish (the one at the top of the pecking order) picking on the subordinate females. In larger groups, any aggression will be spread amongst the group, rather than just one or two fish bearing the brunt. \n  Although the rise of the internet has led to an increase in solitary keeping, it's possible to maintain this species in single male, multiple female groups when adequate measures are taken to allow for the natural social dynamics. This will invariably fail if the aquarium is too small, or insufficiently planted to allow fish of both sexes to avoid constant contact with one another. For more experienced keepers, housing this species socially allows the opportunity to observe behaviours and patterns that the fishes use to communicate mood and status - such as stripe/bar patterns and posture. Key to this approach is an understanding that cover is more important than tank size and all members of the group must have abundant opportunity to vanish from sight of one another. The advantage to this type of keeping, is that spawning occurs naturally with minimal harassment of either sex due to lowered levels of aggression. The same principles can be used to ensure harmony in an aquarium housing a group of female fishes in the absence of a male. Although these fish will adapt to a wide range of conditions, they will be seen at their best in soft, slightly acidic water. The filter should provide a gentle water circulation in order to mimic the natural conditions that this species favours: rice paddies, floodplains and other slow-moving waters. As mentioned above, Siamese Fighting Fish have the ability to take in warm air from above the waters surface, so a small gap must be left between the surface of the water and the cover slides in order for the fish to accomplish this.\n  Tankmates should be relatively small (although not too tiny or they may be mistaken for a snack), peaceful and not prone to nipping fins, although a significant difference exists in long and short finned forms in this regard. If tempted to add a single male to a community aquarium, a long finned fish will be far more likely to struggle with currents from filtration or nipping from companions such as tetras. Rules for compatibility are of limited use with these fish, as males can vary drastically in temperament. Bear in mind that those unused to sharing an aquarium will often exhibit initially heightened levels of territorial aggression due to a lack of socialisation. When settled in their environment, males will show confidence and character that makes owning only one specimen less of a hardship.\nThe vernacular name used in the trade shows the history of this species in the hobby - Thailand has not been known as Siam for over seventy years! A trend to refer to this fish by its American common name of Betta is a welcome use of the binomial name but can lead to confusion with the rest of a very diverse genus.",

        "breeding": "For controlled breeding, a separate aquarium is essential. At the higher end of their temperature range, males will usually come into breeding condition and construct a nest of bubbles amongst plants or under a floating leaf. They often respond well to artificial structures such as the base of a polystyrene cup. Shallow water is often used for spawning and in these conditions it's wise to keep the base of the tank bare to allow the male to retrieve the eggs. Ensure some cover is provided for the female should she need it and present her to the male in a jar or bag to gauge her response to his displays. Conditioned on a quality diet, ripe females will display vertical bars to signal their readiness to spawn. Horizontal stripes are a sign of submission and indicate that the female is unreceptive and should be returned to her normal tank. Add the female to the breeding tank if she's showing interest and the male will guide her to the nest. Following a little posturing the pair will embrace and eggs will be seen falling towards the bottom of the tank, which the male will gather after extricating himself from the female. She takes a little longer to recover and may help him collect the eggs, although this varies from one fish to another. After positioning the eggs in the bubblenest, the male returns and the sequence is repeated. Once the female has laid her eggs, she'll attempt to leave the nest area and should be removed and fed generously to ensure a quick recovery from the demands of egg laying. The male will tend the eggs and maintain the nest, keeping the brood in contact with the water's surface as befits a fish that spawns in water that may be low in oxygen. The eggs should begin to hatch in 24-36 hours and the male will catch any that show signs of falling from the nest, replacing them in the bubbles. The fry are usually free-swimming 3-5 days later, at which time they may be offered tiny foods such as infusoria. They then disperse from the nest and their father's protection. He will remain with the nest and will continue courting females and tending any eggs simultaneously if allowed. Under normal circumstances he should be removed once the young are free swimming and the spawning tank then becomes a rearing tank. It is of extreme importance to maintain a warm layer of air between the surface of the water and the coverslides at all times whilst the fry are developing their labyrinth organ, critical during the first few weeks of their life. Introduced to foods such as newly hatched artemia and microworms the young fish grow quickly and daily water changes are advised to keep them developing optimally.",

Siamese Tiger Fish grow large and require a very spacious and well-filtered aquarium. This is an exclusively freshwater fish which should not be subjected to brackish conditions. The tank should be mature and furnished with plenty of rockwork/driftwood or mangrove root ornaments to create shady hiding places and a plethora of visual barriers. Although juveniles are fairly gregarious, adults are territorially aggressive, and must either be maintained singly or in a group of 6 or more individuals.

The Siamese Tiger Fish used to be very widespread throughout the Indo-China region, but populations have declined dramatically since the 1990s, with the species now extirpated from Thailand and found in much lower numbers elsewhere.

In the wild, a harem of females is served by a single male. His territory may include several small empty Neothauma tanganyicense snail shells, in which he entices females to come and take up residence. Reports from divers in the lake also indicate that this species might inhabit burrows in otherwise suitable habitat where snail shells are absent. Unlike the colonial Neolamprologus shell dwellers, males defend a patch that includes scattered shells inhabited by females within their own territories. Males often bury spare shells until a single female arrives in search of a new home. The females will spend much of their time in their individual shell; indeed it is here that each female will rest, retreat to when necessary, spawn and raise her young. The tank itself does not have to be particularly large for a pair but extra females will require their shells to be a significant distance apart. The aquarium must have a soft sand substrate in which the fish will bury their shells to hide their homes from other cichlids. Offer a selection of widely-spaced empty snail shells (escargot shells are usually quickly approved of). Clean water is essential, so be sure to carry out plenty of regular partial water changes. These fish can be sensitive to changes in conditions, so it is best to ensure that the new water is of the same temperature as the tank, and should be added slowly. In larger aquaria, these fish may be kept with other small and relatively peaceful Tanganyikan cichlids, especially if adjacent habitats such as rockpiles are thoughtfully positioned, as these are fish of open sand habitat.

Sometimes, an early indicator that a pair is getting ready to spawn is an increase in digging activity around the shell. The eggs will be laid and fertilised within the shell, and afterwards, the female stays just inside the shell entrance and guards them. At this time, the male usually defends the perimeter of the shell pit/crater against any possible predators (whether they are present in the tank or not). After 7-10 days, the fry will begin to venture out of the shell, darting quickly back in if they feel threatened. Eventually, they will venture further, and are ignored by the adults in the tank. In species-only set ups, multiple families of fry are tolerated within the same aquarium, the raising of which are extremely rewarding.

        "care": "The Silver Arowana is widely distributed throughout the Amazon River basin in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, and is also found in the Oyapock River in French Guiana and the Rupununi River in Guyana. Here, this predatory surface-dweller prefers heavily vegetated, sluggish waters, including creeks, oxbow lakes, streams, and swampy lagoons, usually lurking in areas with floating plant cover or overhanging branches and feeding on a variety of creatures, including small fishes, crustaceans, frogs, terrestrial and aquatic insects, along with some plant matter. A voluminous aquarium with powerful filtration to match is required if you wish to keep this large, solitary fish. The length and width of the tank is generally much more important than the height, providing as much surface area as possible, allowing for the arowana to turn freely. The aquarium must be biologically mature before adding this species. Decor is not critical, and would mainly be included for the benefit of large, robust fish living at lower levels which may prefer some shelter. Much more important for the arowana would be maximum swimming space and attention to water quality. The Silver Arowana is a voracious eater that produces a lot of waste, and requires continuous excellent water conditions if it is to be free of health problems such as eye and gill issues. To this end, filtration must be powerful and the water well-oxygenated. A frequent partial water change regime is absolutely essential as substandard conditions can lead to the aforementioned ailments. Several huge canister filters can be employed, but sump filtration may be more prudent as then equipment such as heaters can be kept in the sump and out of the main tank where they would be very easily damaged. The Silver Arowana is belligerent and highly territorial with its own kind, so should only ever be kept singly in an aquarium. Tankmates must be chosen with care, as arowanas have deceptively capacious mouths and will eat any fish small enough to swallow. Most arowanas will tolerate large, robust companions that occupy the lower levels, such as big armoured catfish, large characins and cyprinids, sizeable cichlids, or stingrays. However, always introduce all intended tankmates first, the arowana being the very last addition, as otherwise it can be extremely territorial when introducing new fish into what it perceives as its established domain. It is essential that the aquarium has tight fitting coverslides as these fish are expert jumpers; an adult specimen will be heavy, so ensure the lid is weighted down. ***This fish is a huge commitment in terms of housing, equipment, maintenance, and longevity.

Bogwood and rocks/slate can be used to create sheltered areas, but these should be made secure as these cichlids are more than capable of moving d\u00c3\u00a9cor around. Bonding pieces of rock together with aquarium grade silicon sealant prior to filling the tank is sensible. Plants are usually eaten or uprooted, but some aquarists have had success with well-rooted, established hardy motherplants which have had sturdy rocks placed around the stems to prevent uprooting, or else choose varieties such as Anubias sp. and Java Fern which can be tied to and cultivated on the decor. If this fails and plants are still desired, plastic or silk varieties will be the way to go. This is a striking-looking but aggressive species which is best maintained as an established male-female pair. They are intolerant of their own kind, but can usually be combined with other robust cichlids, if the aquarium is spacious. Not to be kept with small fish. Other Central/South American cichlids of a similar size and temperament make great tankmates, as do large armoured catfish. However, if breeding does occur, expect aggression towards the other fish and be prepared to separate them with a tank divider or move the other fish to another aquarium for their own safety. May also be seen on sale as the White Cichlid.",
        "feeding": "Omnivorous. This species requires a balanced diet in order to retain good colours. Slow sinking pellets & wafers, frozen foods such as mosquito larvae, Spirulina/vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, Mysis shrimp, krill, chopped cockle, chopped mussel meat and prawns will all be taken with much enthusiasm. Be sure to provide a vegetable component to the diet, such as spinach, kale, lettuce and cucumber.",
        "breeding": "Prior to spawning, the pair will begin cleaning a potential spawning site, such as a flat piece of slate or a depression made in the substrate. Depending on the size of the female, several thousand eggs will be deposited/fertilised. The parents will fiercely protect the young, which are free-swimming after a week or so. A bonded pair will reproduce on a regular basis, and always in large numbers. Therefore, it is important to have a homing plan in place for (potentially) hundreds, if not thousands, of juvenile fish - as they can quickly overwhelm an aquarium. Parental care continues for 4-6 weeks.",

Ideally the tank will have an open swimming space along the front, with plenty of hiding places amongst smooth rocks and driftwood towards the back. Substrate type is unimportant, gravel or sand may be used. Silver Distichodus are omnivorous and will eat soft leaved plants, so they are not a good choice for planted aquaria. However, more robust species that can be tied onto the decor, such as Anubias sp, Bolbitis sp, and Java Fern (Microsorum) are often ignored, and will make the tank more aesthetically pleasing. Unlike other Distichodus species, the Silver Distichodus is sociable and can be maintained in shoals; indeed, it is best kept in groups of 6 or more. Although fairly peaceful, tankmates do need some consideration, as anything small will be regarded as a snack - good tankmates could include some of the larger tetras, such as Congo tetras, reedfish, smaller Polypterus and Synodontis spp. Avoid any small, slow-moving, and long-finned companions. Filtration should be efficient with a moderate - but not overpowering - water flow, and a good level of oxygenation. As a riverine species, these fish will not tolerate a high nitrate level; ensure partial water changes are carried out on a frequent basis to help keep organic wastes to a minimum. Juvenile Silver Distichodus (inset in main photograph) sport bright crimson fins. As the fish mature, this vivid colour fades away; nevertheless, the adult is a handsome fish and often has a subtle blushing appearance to the cheeks and underside.",

They must have company of their own kind, and 6 specimens would be considered to be the minimum number to house together. Larger groups will help to make them feel much more secure. The aquarium itself should be sited in a quiet location where it does not receive a large amount of continual foot traffic going past. These are very skittish fish that are easily startled, so they must be provided with many shady hiding spots within the aquarium and some very tight fitting coverslides to prevent them from accidentally jumping out. Decor must be chosen with care as anything sharp can cause them injury whenever they decide to make a dash for cover. When cleaning the aquarium, much care must be taken to ensure that the fish do not become too startled. Silver Dollars are largely herbivorous and possess quite powerful dentition. They will devour most plant species in their aquarium. More robust species such as Java Fern or Anubias can sometimes be successful; otherwise you may wish to opt for plastic or silk varieties. Lighting should be subdued. The Silver Dollar aquarium must be well-filtered and well-oxygenated. These fish originated from heavily vegetated tropical rivers with a fair amount of current, so a good flow rate should be provided. Excellent water quality must be maintained at all times, as they are sensitive to elevated nitrate levels. These nervous fish should not be housed with any small (bite-sized) or aggressive species.

The home aquarium should be biologically mature and well filtered, but water movement should be kept as gentle as possible. Soft, acidic water is preferable, and this can be helped along with the addition of peat to the aquarium filter. Dark d\u00c3\u00a9cor and plenty of bogwood, caves, and planting - including floating species - will all help these fish to feel secure. It is imperative that the tank has tight fitting coverslides as these fish are highly skilled jumpers; and do ensure there are no escape holes where equipment feeds into the tank (block any gaps with filter sponge). Silver Hatchetfish are a timid shoaling species, which congregate in large numbers in nature; for this reason, they must be kept in groups of 6 or more (10+ is better) in order to feel secure and display natural behaviour. Tankmates must be small and peaceful, as Silver Hatchetfish are easily intimidated. Good companions could include small peaceable tetras, pencilfish, Corydoras catfish, dwarf cichlids such as Apistogramma or Mikrogeophagus, and some of the smaller Loricariidae (suckermouth catfish). Much attention must be paid to water quality since Silver Hatchets can be sensitive to elevated nitrates and swings in water chemistry. At present, this species is not being bred on a commercial basis, and so the fish seen in the trade are almost always wild caught; for this reason it is especially important to quarantine new purchases before adding to the main aquarium.

Unless your fish are kept in a species-only tank, it would be best to set up a separate aquarium for the purposes of breeding. Soft, acidic water is essential (peat filtration is recommended). The fish should be well-conditioned on a diet of small fruitflies and black mosquito larvae, and following a lengthy courtship ritual, eggs should be laid on floating plants or plants growing near the water's surface. The parents will predate on the eggs/fry, so they should be acclimatised back to the main aquarium once spawning has ceased. Once the eggs have hatched, and the fry have become free-swimming a few days later, they can be offered infusoria and paramecium, moving on to baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii) as they grow.",

The male immediately follows behind her and fertilises them, and this is repeated until the female is spent of eggs. 48-72 hours later, the eggs will hatch (the parents may assist with this) and the wrigglers are cared for until they are free-swimming, when the fry are guarded by both parents, with the male being more active in guarding the territorial perimeter.

        "care": "The Similis Shelldweller is known from the southern end of Lake Tanganyika, where it is found in large colonies living in empty shells on sand beds in the shallows. In the wild, a colony of females is served by a single male. His colony will be made up of several small empty Neothauma tanganyicense snail shells, in which he entices females to come and take up residence. In certain areas of the lake, these snail shells are found in the most enormous piles. They do not disintegrate because of the hardness of the water, and masses of colonies of these shell-dwellers are found living side by side. The females will spend much of their time in their individual shell; indeed it is here that each female will rest, retreat to when necessary, spawn and raise her young. Each male will defend his territory of shells and females, all making use of the very natural cover. The tank itself does not have to be particularly large for a small colony, but it must have a soft sand substrate and plenty of empty snail shells on offer (Apple snail shells or escargot shells are usually quickly approved of). The fish will dig around and under the snail shells so that they eventually end up on the tank floor rather than on top of the sand itself, and watching them excavate these little depressions and move sand about the aquarium is fascinating. These fish should never be kept without snail shells (or substitutes such as small PVC elbow tubes). Once spawning has taken place (see below for details), several generations of fish may live together. However, if you intend to keep a large number of the fry, be sure to upgrade the tank for a larger model, or else move some of the fish to another aquarium. Needless to say, the more fish present, the more shells will be needed. Undergravel filters do not work well with shell-dwelling species, as they do tend to regularly excavate down, even in deeper sand beds. External filter inlets should be covered with a sponge in order to prevent any fry from being drawn in. This sponge should be coarse enough to allow a good flow of water into the filter, but at the same time, of a cell size which will stop the passage of any young into the filter. Unfortunately, planting is not always very successful due to the uprooting behaviour of these fish. Clean water is essential, so be sure to carry out plenty of regular partial water changes. These fish can be sensitive to changes in conditions, so it is best to ensure that the new (dechlorinated) water is of the same temperature as the tank water, and should be added slowly. In larger aquaria, these fish may be kept with other small and relatively peaceful Tanganyikan cichlids, but the fry survival rate will obviously not be quite so high. Do not use shells with tight narrow spirals, as the females may become trapped.",
        "feeding": "Foods should be of an appropriately small size. Flake, micropellets, small frozen foods such as daphnia, baby brineshrimp, and cyclops.",
        "breeding": "It may not be obvious that your Similis Shelldwellers have spawned until fry are seen at the entrance of their shell. Sometimes, an early indicator that a pair is getting ready to spawn is an increase in digging activity around the shell. The eggs will be laid and fertilised within the shell, and afterwards, the female stays just inside the shell entrance and guards them. At this time, the male usually defends the perimeter of the shell pit/crater against any possible predators (whether they are present in the tank or not). After 7-10 days, the fry will begin to venture out of the shell, darting quickly back in if they feel threatened. Eventually, they will venture further, and are ignored by the adults in the tank. In species-only set ups, multiple families of fry are tolerated within the same aquarium, the raising of which are extremely rewarding. Do remember to thin the colonies out occasionally, moving the fry on to other tanks/fishkeeping friends/fish stores.",

This is a large sized characin that requires an aquarium at least 6ft long with powerful filtration to match. Juvenile fish grow quickly, so spacious quarters are required from the outset. Ideally there will be an open swimming space along the front of the tank, with plenty of hiding places amongst smooth rocks and driftwood towards the back. Substrate type is unimportant, gravel or sand may be used. Sixbar Distichodus are omnivorous and will eat soft leaved plants, so they are not a good choice for planted aquaria. However, more robust species that can be tied onto the decor, such as Anubias sp, Bolbitis sp, and Java Fern (Microsorum) are often ignored, and will make the tank more aesthetically pleasing. Filtration should be efficient with a moderate - but not overpowering - water flow, and a good level of oxygenation. As a riverine species, these fish will not tolerate a high nitrate level; ensure partial water changes are carried out on a frequent basis to help keep organic wastes to a minimum. Sixbar Distichodus can behave somewhat unpredictably in the aquarium, with some accepting other large, robust tankmates, and others not tolerating them at all. In voluminous aquaria, juveniles may be kept in groups, but usually as they mature they become increasingly aggressive towards conspecifics and will have to be separated for their own safety. For this reason, it is often better to house just one per tank, allowing it to grow up alongside other large fish that can look after themselves - but do observe carefully. Possible companions could include other large characins (but not other Distichodus species), sizeable cyprinids, large armoured catfish and the like. Ensure that the tank has a heavy, tight fitting lid, as these fish are expert jumpers. This fish is similar in appearance to the Long-nosed Distichodus (D. lusosso); however, the Sixbar Distichodus attains a larger adult size and is more chunky in appearance with the noticeably shorter snout. This is a stunning, brightly coloured fish when juvenile, but unfortunately the beautiful markings do fade with age, the adults taking on an overall rather dull grey appearance.",

Here the water is turbulent and highly oxygenated. This habitat should be replicated as closely as possible in the home aquarium by using extra powerheads (in addition to the return flow from filters) to create a river type effect. The surface of the water should be visibly moving to ensure that there is a very high amount of oxygenation within the water at all times. An additional air-pump is also a handy back-up. Without such a high level of oxygenation and water movement, Slender Blockhead Cichlids will not fare well at all. These fish should really only be added to aquariums that are fully mature. Such tanks will have a good established growth of algae on the decor for the fish to graze upon in order to consume the micro-organisms within. Lighting should be fairly bright in order to encourage a decent amount of algal growth. Ideally, the aquarium will be at least 36\"\u009d long, and contain a multitude of hiding spots amongst rocks, cobbles and bogwood. As these cichlids like to dig, provide a sand substrate and ensure all decor is secure and rocks are placed on the aquarium base (rather than on top of the substrate) so that they cannot be undermined. Flat smooth rocks should be placed in the path of the flow, where these fish will often congregate just as they would do in their natural boulder-strewn habitats. Be sure to incorporate a number of quieter resting areas out of the path of direct flow too. Plants can be included in the river style aquarium, but not all species will fare well under fast current. Having said this, many aquarists have had a good deal of success with Anubias species and Java fern (Microsorum sp.) tied and trained to grow on the decor. Plants are not found in great abundance in the natural habitat of Slender Blockhead Cichlids, so are not considered essential, but they will help with water quality and will make the aquarium look more aesthetically pleasing. Slender Blockhead Cichlids are territorial and best maintained as a male-female pair - they should not be kept with any other cichlid species. Tankmates could include some of the African tetra species or Synodontis catfish. These characterful cichlids are unusual in that they spend a lot of time hopping about on the bottom of the aquarium, in much the same manner as gobies. This is because they have a modified swim bladder that reduces buoyancy in the midst of vigorous currents.",

The water should be neutral to slightly soft and acidic with the temperature set towards the higher end of the preferred range. The best way to obtain a compatible pair is to purchase a group of young fish and allow them to pair off naturally. Once a pair has formed, the remaining fish should be moved to another tank. The breeding pair can then be conditioned on plenty of frozen foods. If ready to spawn, they will choose a suitable cave, either one that already exists amongst the decor, or they will excavate one themselves. Spawning is a rather secretive affair and will take place inside the cave. Up to 100 eggs will be deposited on the cave walls/ceiling, and these should hatch in 4-7 days (temperature dependent). It takes a further 5-7 days for the young to become free swimming, and they will be herded around the aquarium by the parents whilst they search for food. The parent fish are fiercely protective, and if there are other fish in the tank, they will attack them if they venture too close to the fry. The parents will guard their fry for up to 3 months, or until they have their next brood. Even when the parents are protecting a new brood, any previous young that are still in the aquarium are usually tolerated.

Here, this torpedo-shaped, energetic shoaling species is found in highly oxygenated rivers and streams. The aquarium should be voluminous, even for smaller specimens, as they can swim at speed and require ample swimming space. Ideally, the aquarium should be sited in a quiet location where it does not receive a large amount of foot traffic going past all the time. These are very skittish fish that are easily startled, so they must be provided with many shady hiding spots within the aquarium and tight-fitting coverslides to prevent them from accidentally jumping out. D\u00c3\u00a9cor must be chosen with care as anything sharp can cause them injury whenever they decide to make a dash for cover; a sandy substrate with smooth pieces of driftwood and water-worn rocks is ideal. The aquarium should be planted with robust species (such as Anubias spp. and Java Fern) at the sides and back, leaving a generously-sized open swimming area in the centre. Some tough floating vegetation can also be grown over the calmer areas of the aquarium and will provide natural surface cover, which should help to reduce skittishness. When cleaning the aquarium, much care must be taken to ensure that the fish do not become too startled - keep hand movements slow etc. It is essential that the aquarium housing Slender Hemiodus is well-filtered via external canisters and very well-aerated, perhaps using additional powerheads and placing any spray-bar returns from filters just above the water line to create turbulence. These riverine fish will not cope with a build up of nitrogenous waste, so aim for high water quality at all times with partial water changes carried out on a very regular basis. Gregarious by nature, this species should always be kept in groups of 8 or more for their continued wellbeing.

It is crucial that these caves are situated in an area with decent water movement. When in spawning condition, males will choose a preferred cave and defend it from any other males present, whilst at the same time, will try to entice a ripe female inside. Spawning does not always take place straight away, indeed it can be some days before the female is ready to deposit her eggs, but the fish will remain inside the cave together during this time, the male usually blocks the entrance. Once the eggs have been laid and fertilised, the male fish often has to force the female out of the cave before he begins his parental guarding duties. The female plays no further part in brood care, but the male will be seen fanning the eggs with his pectoral fins and blocking the cave entrance from any intruders. Eggs typically number around 20-30 and take 5-7 days to hatch. The fry will feed from their sizeable yolk sacs for the first few days, and after this has been consumed, they will require very regular feedings of baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii), microworms, and various small or crushed dried sinking foods. It is important that food is available to the fry at all times as they can all too easily starve, but keep a very close eye on water quality when feeding constantly, and perform lots of very regular but very small partial changes to keep nitrogenous waste levels as low as possible. The adult Snowball Plecs pose no threat to the fry, but other fish sharing the same tank might do.

They superficially resemble the wild form of the Chinese Barb (P. semifasciolatus) but there are one or two small differences: P. snyderi have a pair of minuscule, maxillary barbels (which are sometimes very rudimentary or not even present at all), whereas those of P. semifasciolatus are much more prominent. P. snyderi also typically has 4-5 dark vertical markings along the midline of the body, whereas P. semifasciolatus has 7-9 of these. Snyder's Barbs are a peaceful and relatively hardy species, which should be maintained in groups of 6 or more due to their shoaling nature. A larger group will not only make the fish feel more secure, but will also result in a more natural, effective looking shoal. Larger numbers should ensure a mix of both sexes, with rival males displaying intense red colouration on the lower half of the body when ready to spawn, making for quite the spectacle. Ideally the aquarium will be planted at the back and sides, along with a few tangles of driftwood, and an open swimming area provided in the centre. These barbs will nibble at fine-leaved and soft-leaved plants, so choose plant species that are more robust, or else those that grow quickly. Filtration should be efficient, with areas of moderate water movement and a decent level of oxygenation. This species prefers temperatures at the lower end of the tropical range, so ensure that other tankmates have the same needs. Some of the Crossocheilus and Garra species would make good companions, as would many of the Nemacheilus/Schistura brook loaches or some of the medium sized danionins.

The tank should be furnished with several large clumps of Java moss or mats of fake plastic grass for the female to scatter her eggs over. Spawning is likely to be triggered by a slight temperature rise and when the first rays of morning light hit the aquarium, with the male vigorously driving the female back and forth over the top of the plants where she will scatter her eggs (simultaneously fertilised by the male). Most of the eggs should fall to the relative safety of the moss, but be sure to remove the hungry parents as soon as spawning has ceased as they will otherwise begin hunting out the eggs.",

This spawning process will repeat several times until the female is depleted of eggs, which can total somewhere between 100 and 175. The male then begins to guard the nest, and at this point, the female should be removed. After 48 hours, the eggs should hatch into tiny wrigglers, and soon after become free-swimming.

The water is very soft and acidic and oftentimes stained a tea-colour from tannins. These fish are an ideal choice for small, heavily planted aquaria. The tank must be mature and have myriad of hiding places amongst driftwood and thick vegetation, which should include floating species to help diffuse the light. Filtration should be good but water movement gentle, as most populations of Spice Rasbora are found inhabiting sluggish waters. These peaceful shoaling fish can be rather timid, so a decent sized group of 12 or more will help to give them confidence. Tankmates, if desired, must also be small and peaceful; for example, small Caridina and Neocaridina shrimp, Kuhli loaches (Pangio spp.), Otocinclus catfish, pygmy Corydoras spp., Eirmotus octozona, Trigonostigma spp., and Blue Eyes (Pseudomugil spp.) could all be considered suitable.

        "breeding": "B. urophthalmoides belongs to a group of fish that are known as continual spawners, which is to say that in the case of mature fish, small numbers of eggs are laid daily. In densely planted aquaria with large groups of well-conditioned B. urophthalmoides, spawnings should occur regularly with eggs being scattered over vegetation and decor. The eggs and resultant tiny larvae will be seen as food by the adults, but if there is plenty of plant cover, some should survive into adulthood. If a greater number of fry is desired, a separate bare-bottomed breeding aquarium (with air powered sponge filter) should be set up with plenty of Java moss/spawning mops and a layer of mesh raised a small way from the tank bottom so that any eggs that fail to adhere to the plants/mops fall through to safety, away from the adults. The water conditions should match that of the main aquarium. Carefully add one or two well-conditioned pair/s of B. urophthalmoides, and once settled they should spawn the following morning. It is recommended that the adults are moved back to the main aquarium within 48 hours as the first eggs will be starting to hatch by then. The miniscule fry will feed off their yolk sacs to begin with, but will soon require suitably sized foodstuffs such as infusoria and Paramecium, moving on to slightly bigger foods such as Artemia nauplii as they grow. A variety of foods may be needed for a while as you may end up with fry of slightly different sizes from the 2 days of continual spawning. Small partial water changes must be carried out with the utmost of care to avoid shocking the extremely delicate fry.",

Whilst they may not be as flamboyantly coloured as some species, they more than make up for this with their absolutely fascinating breeding behaviour. In the wild, Splash Tetras are found in small sluggish blackwater tributaries and quiet river channels off of the main waterways, typically with an abundance of overhanging vegetation. They have also been known to move into flooded forests during the rainy season. The aquarium should be mature, water movement gentle, and the tank furnished with driftwood and plenty of plant life. Peat filtration would be very beneficial. Ideally they should be kept in a tank with a significantly lowered water level or a paludarium type set up (see notes on breeding below) with plants that grow out of the water with leaves draping above the water\"\u2122s surface. This will enable them to behave in a natural manner when ready to spawn. As these fish are accomplished jumpers, the aquarium must have tight fitting coverslides with no escape holes where equipment might feed in to the tank (holes can be blocked with bits of coarse filter sponge). As a shoaling species, Splash Tetras are best maintained in good sized groups; six specimens at the minimum and 10+ being much better. Due to their relatively small adult size, care must be taken when considering tankmates. They are easily intimidated by boisterous fish and should not be housed with anything that would consider them a snack. Good companions would include smaller species of Corydoras catfish, dwarf cichlids, pencilfish, and other small blackwater tetras.",
        "feeding": "In the wild, these fish have been observed feeding on small worms, insects, and crustaceans. In the aquarium, they are not fussy feeders and should be offered a good mixture of foodstuffs including small meaty frozen fare e.g. mini-bloodworm, white mosquito larvae, daphnia, and cyclops, plus flake and micro granules.",
        "breeding": "The intriguing way in which these fish breed is what appeals to many fishkeepers. As mentioned above, the breeding tank must have a reduced water level with plenty of overhanging plant growth above the water's surface, as it is on these emergent growths that the Splash Tetra will lay its eggs. The water should be very soft (< 8 dH) and slightly acidic. When ready to breed, the male will search for a suitable spawning site by repeatedly jumping out of the water until he finds an appropriate area. He will then display to a ripe female, chasing her towards the chosen spawning location/s. The pair will leap from the water together, held together by their ventral fins, and will land against the spawning site/s (usually the underside of leaves but occasionally on the coverslides if suitable vegetation cannot be found) where 5-10 eggs are laid by the female and are immediately fertilised by the male. This procedure is repeated several times until between 150 and 200 eggs have been deposited. The female then takes no further part in caring for the brood. However, the male fish attentively and intermittently tends to the clutch of eggs by flicking his tail and splashing water up onto them to keep them moist. If the eggs have been deposited in more than one location, quite amazingly, he will splash at them in sequence. In between his visits to moisten the eggs, he will hide amongst nearby vegetation. After 36 hours or so, the eggs will hatch and the fry will fall down into the water, and at this point parental care ceases. The adults do not actively prey on the young, but some aquarists like to move the adults to a separate tank to ensure a higher number of fry survive. The fry will begin feeding after 2 days, once their yolk sacs have been absorbed. Offer them infusoria, brineshrimp nauplii, and microworms. In heavily planted aquaria, a good number of the fry should survive to adulthood.",

This is a medium-sized, peaceful species that is ideally suited to planted community aquaria. The tank should be as spacious as possible, as these are fairly active fish, and they should be maintained in groups of 6 or more due to their shoaling nature.

A conditioned group (3 females, 2 males) should then be acclimatised across to the breeding aquarium, which should be furnished with plenty of fine-leaved plants/Java moss clumps. After a time, a male will swim in front of a female, displaying to her. He will then begin to drive the female over the plants, utilising the whole length of the tank. The relatively large eggs will be scattered over the plants a few at a time, usually totalling around 20-60 per day. These fish are known as 'continual spawners' which means that the spawning activity takes place over several days/weeks. This can present problems to the aquarist in that some adult fish may begin to consume the eggs as they are scattered, although this may not be a problem if the adults are kept well fed. However, many fishkeepers have found the eggs to be remarkably tough and have had great success in siphoning them out into another aquarium (containing matching water from the spawning tank) or else using spawning mops, which, when having caught a number of the eggs, can be moved to a separate tank (again with matching water) and replaced with a new mop, as and when each series of eggs are deposited. The eggs will usually hatch in 6-9 days (dependent on temperature) and once free-swimming, the tiny fry can be offered infusoria, moving onto larger foodstuffs as they develop.",

All are specialised for a life amongst waterlogged wood.\nAs a member of the Panaqolus (\"dwarf Panaque\") genus, this species is ideally suited to average sized aquaria, providing that a few key requirements are met. Firstly the tank should be biologically mature and must contain an abundance of bogwood, as this forms an essential part of the diet (these fish can actually be heard rasping their way around the aquarium!). There should be plenty of sheltered retreats created from the bogwood as well as from smooth rockwork, so that these nocturnal catfish feel comfortable during the day. They do not enjoy overly bright illumination, so ensure that there are many shady areas formed by driftwood, caves, and even floating plants, which will help to diffuse the light. Robust plants such as Anubias and Java Fern could be included (tied to the wood for best results) but avoid soft-leaved or delicate plants as these will be uprooted or eaten. Excellent water conditions should be maintained at all times via the use of a powerful filtration system that can cope with the amount of wood waste. A good current and high level of oxygenation will serve the fish well, and may even tempt them into breeding.\nClown plecs are generally very peaceable, but males will squabble with one another over territory, so if planning on maintaining more than one specimen, ensure the tank is spacious and furnished with enough visual barriers and caves to keep everyone happy.

These fascinating bottom-dwelling cichlids are mostly solitary and spend much of their time hopping around amongst pebbles, feeding on algae and the microscopic organisms living within it. Spotfin Goby Cichlids have specialised dentition to assist them with scraping the algae from rocks, and a much reduced swimbladder that helps them negate buoyancy and keep their position on the substrate. The aquarium that houses these fish should be biologically mature, with a soft sand substrate and plenty of smooth pebbles and cobbles. Filtration should be efficient with areas of brisk water movement along with some quieter resting spots out of the current. There should be a decent level of oxygenation, and small frequent partial water changes will help keep nitrate to a minimum. Lighting can be fairly bright to encourage algae growth over the stones. Spotfin Goby Cichlids are territorial towards conspecifics, but should not be kept alongside aggressive species. Ideally, tankmates will be of similar size and occupy different areas of the aquarium to the goby cichlids, such as Cyprichromis or Paracyprichromis spp which tend to stay higher up in the water column. It is best to keep Spotfin Goby Cichlids singly or as a compatible pair, and it should be noted that once a pair forms, the bond is lifelong. The aquarium must be very spacious if more than one pair are to be kept together, with plenty of visual barriers amongst the decor.

        "breeding": "Bi-parental mouthbrooder. This species has been bred in the home aquarium, but it is not a frequent occurrence. It would make a great breeding project for the serious hobbyist. When ready to spawn, the female selects a suitable flat rock as a spawning site and cleans it thoroughly. The pair will then display to one another whilst circling the spawning site. The female subsequently deposits one or two relatively large eggs, and then immediately turns to take them up into her mouth as the male simultaneously fertilises them. This is repeated until the female is spent of eggs, which may number 10-30 depending on her size/maturity. The eggs are carried in the mouth of the female for around 14 days, during which time she will not feed, and will be easily recognisable by her distended mouth. Once the eggs hatch, the female then transfers the fry to the mouth of the male one or two at a time. He will then continue incubating the fry for a further 7-14 days until they have absorbed their yolk sacs, before releasing them (usually at night) a few at a time and ensuring they each find hiding places. There is no need to immediately remove the parent fish or fry if they are in a species-only aquarium, as the parents will tolerate the fry for a reasonable period of time. In Tanganyikan community aquaria, however, it would be best to move the mouthbrooding male to a tank with no predators, before he is due to release the fry. Once they have been released, he may then be acclimatised back to the main aquarium. The free-swimming fry can be offered crushed Spirulina flake and baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii).

Here the clear water flows quickly over substrates of bedrock where it is forced past boulders at speed and is saturated with oxygen. Such water courses are surrounded with marginal vegetation, and an aufwuchs-rich biofilm covers the rocky substrate, which these fish enjoy grazing upon. The aquarium should be mature, with a soft sand or fine rounded gravel substrate and various pieces of smooth rockwork and bogwood arranged to create lots of shady caves and crevices. As plants are not found in any great abundance in the natural habitat, they can be omitted from the aquascape, although a few areas of hardy vegetation (that can cope with current) will make the aquarium look more aesthetically pleasing and will help with water quality. There should be brisk water movement and a high level of oxygenation, perhaps provided by powerheads (in addition to the current generated by the filtration). Small frequent partial water changes will help keep nitrate to a minimum; as a riverine species these fish are rather sensitive to the build up of nitrogenous waste. The Spotted Bulldog Plec is generally peaceful, but it will show minor territorial aggression towards its own kind if not given enough space. In most instances though, they can be maintained in small groups as long as there is adequate room and enough hiding places to go round. Tankmates could include any medium sized peaceful shoaling fish that occupy the mid to upper levels of the water column and which also enjoy the fast-flowing conditions.

        "care": "In its native heavily vegetated habitats, the intriguing Spotted Climbing Perch mimics fallen foliage and other aquatic debris in order to trick unsuspecting passing fish. Here they skulk around, assuming a \"nose-down\" position, which gives the impression of innocent fallen leaves to potential prey. Any moderately-sized fish that swim too near are ambushed with ferocious speed and agility. This behaviour continues in the home aquarium, and is why this beautiful and captivating member of the Anabantidae family is best maintained in a species-only aquarium. This is not only because of its predatory nature towards small fish, but also because it tends to become bullied by larger more aggressive species. Spotted Climbing Perch are not particularly belligerent themselves if adequate numbers are kept and suitable space is given, but their surprisingly capacious mouths and nocturnal activity spells a very real danger for standard community fish. In the wild, as you may expect, this species is found in a variety of different habitats, the waters of which are all relatively slow-moving with an abundance of aquatic vegetation. Therefore the aquarium housing Spotted Climbing Perch should be densely planted with plenty of tall trailing plants, plus floating varieties, for them to lurk amongst. They will also appreciate other shady areas assembled from bogwood pieces and rocky caves. Ideally, the tank will be at least 4ft long because these fish are fast growers and will quickly attain a large adult size. Small partial water changes should be carried out on a regular basis as these fish will not fare well if subjected to high levels of nitrate. Spotted Climbing Perch must be maintained either singly, or else as a group of 5 or more individuals. Groups smaller than 5 are rarely successful and we do not recommend this be attempted. When keeping a larger group, all individuals MUST be introduced at the same time to prevent unnecessary territorial arguments that would otherwise be aimed at any newcomers. Any specimens added to the group at a later date could be caused so much stress by the long-term residents, that they do not make it through the acclimatisation period. It is of utmost importance to leave a small gap of warm air between the water's surface and the coverslides in order for these labyrinth fish to come up and gulp air from time to time. The coverslides will also prevent your Spotted Climbing Perch from jumping clear of the aquarium should they become startled. Some aquarists claim to have had success in housing these fish alongside Synodontis catfish, Hoplo Catfish, larger members of the Loricariidae family (Suckermouth cats), Siamese Flying Foxes (Crossocheilus siamensis), and larger Rainbowfish species, but you are guaranteed to see these fish at their best in a species-only planted aquarium. Note: Take care when netting Spotted Climbing Perch from the aquarium as the small spines on the gill covers can easily become entangled. It is best to \"herd\" the fish into a bag or suitable container. Not recommended for beginners. May also be seen on sale as Leopard Bushfish.",
        "feeding": "Can be tricky, particularly when first introduced to new surroundings. The diet should be \"size dependent\", i.e. tailored to the size of your particular specimens. Small live or (defrosted) frozen foods are best for younger fish e.g. mosquito larvae, daphnia, brineshrimp etc. Larger specimens will take bigger foodstuffs such as Mysis shrimp, chopped prawns and chopped earthworms (make sure these are clean and free of any pesticides). May eventually take some dried foods, but this should not be relied upon. Observe to make sure any dried foods that are offered are actually taken, as otherwise the rotting uneaten food can easily foul the aquarium water. Warning: Will eat any fish that can fit into their deceptively cavernous mouths!",
        "breeding": "Challenging, as the fry are extremely difficult to raise. A pair can be triggered into spawning by carefully acclimatising to a separate softwater breeding tank (peat filtration recommended) with plenty of plant cover. The temperature should be set at the higher end of their preferred range. This species is an egg scatterer and there are reports of a small bubblenest being constructed during the pre-spawning courtship ritual. Once spawning has ceased, the parent fish must be removed from the aquarium to prevent predation. Eggs can number 500 or more. As with other members of this family, it is of extreme importance to maintain a warm layer of air between the surface of the water and the cover slides at all times whilst the fry are developing their labyrinth organ, critical during the first few weeks of their life. Numerous problems such as susceptibility to velvet disease, difficulty in getting the tiny fry to feed, water pollution and developmental problems with the labyrinth organ have all been frequently encountered when trying to grow on the fry of the Spotted Climbing Perch.",

        "care": "The Spotted Congo Puffer is known from Pool Malebo (formerly Stanley Pool), a lake-like widening in the lower reaches of the Congo River system in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Here it is found in rocky habitats amongst the swiftly flowing, highly oxygenated waters, where it is may be observed lurking between crevices in the rocks or riparian vegetation, ready to ambush any small fish or crustaceans that venture past. The Spotted Congo Puffer requires a good sized, mature aquarium with a soft, sandy substrate and plenty of caves and crevices to hide between. As these fish are voracious eaters and can create a fair amount of waste, decent filtration should be employed (an external canister is ideal). There should be areas of moderate water movement and a high level of oxygenation, perhaps achieved by a powerhead with flow diverter angled up towards the surface of the water, or by keeping a slightly dropped water line so that water returning from  the filter splashes down onto  the water's surface. This is the smallest species of African pufferfish and is much sought after by oddball enthusiasts, however, imports from this region tend to be quite sporadic so this is one of the rarest pufferfish in the trade. As such, there are only a handful of reports of this fish being kept in the home aquarium, and although most suggest that this particular pufferfish is relatively peaceful towards its own kind and other species, it would be prudent to be cautious and have a means of separating tankmates if necessary. Ensuring there is an abundance of visual barriers within the aquarium will provide the best chance of keeping a group (introduce simultaneously, and observe very carefully), and any possible companions should be short-finned and fast-swimming. Rocks, driftwood, and hardy current-tolerant plants can all be utilised in an aquascape for these puffers. As with other puffer species, this fish can inflate when frightened or cornered. It should never be provoked into doing so, and never above water where it can take on air, which can prove fatal. If moving a Spotted Congo Puffer to larger quarters, the fish should be herded into a solid container under the water so as to remove the necessity of netting and lifting it clear of the water. Spotted Congo Puffers are capable of colour change, depending on their surroundings or mood. As a scaleless species, be aware that these fish are very sensitive to medications. Lastly, please remember that pufferfish can vary in temperament, and there may be exceptions to the expected behaviour of the species - even a pair that has been deemed 'compatible'. It is always a good idea to have some sort of tank divider - or even a spare aquarium - handy, should circumstances necessitate their use. Spotted Congo Puffers are intolerant of poor water quality - as already mentioned above, make use of a decent filtration system and perform plenty of regular partial water changes.",

Unfortunately, it can be a little prone to barbel infections/erosion, so it is of paramount importance that the fish are kept on a soft sand substrate (rather than gravel where waste can build up unseen) in order to protect these delicate sensory organs. Regular maintenance, including frequent partial water changes, should be carried out in order to keep these fish in good condition. Provide plenty of shady areas amongst driftwood, rocks, and areas of dense planting. Other peaceful species such as some of the smaller pencilfish, tetra, and rasboras make ideal tankmates, and their presence as dither fish in midwater will encourage the Corydoras out into view more often. Corydoras have the ability to breathe air intestinally, so a small gap should be left between the surface of the water and the cover slides in order for the fish to come up to the surface and take air in. It may do this numerous times per day.\nThis species can be very hard to tell apart from several other spotted Cory species, especially B. agassizii. Although hard to tell without direct comparisons, ambiacus has many small grey spots scattered over its body, whereas agassizii tends to have slightly larger, darker spots which are roughly assembled in three longitudinal rows. There is a black blotch in the dorsal fin of both species, and in ambiacus, this is largely absent from the leading dorsal spine, which is white at the top.

        "care": "The Spotted Onesided Livebearer is known from the clear, sub-tropical lowland tributaries of the Rio Uruguai. This unusual, viviparous fish is a member of the Family Anablepidae, which also includes the Four-eyed fishes (Anableps spp.) and is only seldomly seen in the trade. Jenynsia species are what's known as \"onesided\" livebearers: many experts asserting that they only mate on one side, yet recently, other sources have disputed this. It is believed that the male is restricted by only being able to direct his gonopodium to one particular side, and the female can only ever be fertilised from one side due to a modification of the genital opening. So it was thought that, for example, that \"left handed\" males could only mate with \"right handed\" females; however, it appears that left handed males can go \"head-to-tail\" with a left handed female and still fertilise her (and vice versa for right handed fish). The aquarium should be mature and well-filtered, with plenty of shady areas provided amongst hardy aquatic vegetation (both rooted and floating) and decor such as spindly driftwood pieces and rocky caves. The fish may nibble on soft-leaved plants, although will not usually cause too much damage if a diet with a vegetable component is offered. This is a fairly peaceful species that is best kept in a species tank environment, with 2 or more females to every male; this will reduce the amount of attention that any one female receives from the often extremely amorous males and will also further your chances of raising more fry. A shoal of at least 8-10 fish is preferable in a good sized tank, and although there may be a bit of minor chasing between rival males, they are rarely aggressive towards one another and generally do not cause damage. Tankmates are possible, but do ensure these are short-finned, fast-swimming, and are happy in the same cool conditions - although be aware that in such a community setting, the J. onca fry may be at risk from predation. Be sure to keep the temperature cool as these fish do not fare well above 24 \u00b0C (75 deg F); a means of chilling the water may be necessary during the warmer summer months. Filtration should be efficient and the water well-oxygenated, with partial water changes carried out on a very regular basis in order to keep nitrogenous wastes to a minimum. All members of the genus Jenynsia (of which there are currently 15 recognised species) are diagnosable by the possession of an unscaled tubular gonopodium formed chiefly by the third, sixth, and seventh anal-fin rays, and by the possession of tricuspid teeth in the outer mandibular series in adults. There is also a lack of segmentation on both the proximal and distal quarters of the sixth anal-fin ray of adult males, and vertically inclined proximal radials associated with the first six anal-fin rays of adult males. J. onca is distinguished from its congeners by the following autapomorphies: (1) presence of a large convex expansion in the distal segments of the right half of sixth anal fin-ray of adult males; and (2) distinct ovoid to circular dark spots confined to ventral half of flank posterior to pelvic fin, which gradually become more circular towards the ventral profile. Interestingly, the specific name \"onca\" is in allusion to the colour pattern, which resembles that of the jaguar (Pantera onca).",
        "feeding": "Flake, green flake, micropellets, small meaty frozen foods e.g. bloodworm, white mosquito larvae, daphnia, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, plus some vegetable matter such as blanched spinach, lettuce, kale etc. These fish have a fast metabolism and should be offered small amounts of food 2 or 3 times per day; however, be sure to employ efficient filtration and perform partial water changes very regularly to keep nitrate as low as possible.",
        "breeding": "J. onca are livebearers, which means that the females give birth to live young. Well conditioned fish should reproduce quite readily under favourable conditions. As detailed above, these fish are either \"right handed\" or \"left handed\", the female only able to accept the male's gonopodium from one side, and the male only able to direct his gonopodium left or right. Males tend to be very amorous a lot of the time, so try to ensure you have 2 or more females to every male. The smaller male in the above photo continually tried to mate with the larger female whilst in the photo aquarium - he being left handed, approaching this right handed female continually from her right hand side. After fertilisation occurs, the female gestates for 6 weeks, after which time she will give birth to between 10 and 20 free-swimming fry. The adults (and other fish species in the aquarium) may predate on the fry if not separated. However, a good number will normally manage to survive onto adulthood when kept in a well planted aquarium with lots of natural hiding places.",

There should be brisk water movement and a high level of oxygenation, perhaps provided by powerheads (in addition to the current generated by the filtration). Small frequent partial water changes will help keep nitrate to a minimum; as a riverine species these fish are rather sensitive to the build up of nitrogenous waste. The Spotted Orange Seam Plec is generally peaceful, but it will show minor territorial aggression towards its own kind if not given enough space. In most instances though, they can be maintained in small groups as long as there is adequate room and enough hiding places to go round.

Here, this piscivorous species is found in moderately flowing tributaries close to riparian and overhanging vegetation, where it lurks in mid-top water waiting for smaller fish to hunt. The aquarium should be spacious and mature, with tangles of driftwood and dense thickets of tall plants to provide shade and hiding places. Floating vegetation can also be useful in helping to diffuse the light and will provide additional shelter and security for the fish. The tank should be sited in a quiet location where it does not receive a large amount of continual foot traffic going past. These are skittish fish that are easily startled, so they must be provided with enough swimming space and many shady hiding spots, along with some very tight fitting coverslides to prevent them from accidentally jumping out. Prior to setting up a tank for this species, it is worth purchasing some structured 3-D aquarium-safe background and attaching this to the inside glass of the back and sides. This will help to prevent the fish from damaging their long, delicate jaws when swimming at speed into the otherwise unseen glass at the sides. When cleaning the aquarium, take things slowly so that the fish do not become too startled. Filtration should be efficient, with areas of moderate water movement, along with some quieter resting spots out of the current. Ensure there is a decent level of dissolved oxygen, and perform regular partial water changes in order to keep nitrogenous wastes to a minimum. Despite their predatory nature, Spotted Pike Characins are peaceful with one another and are best kept in groups of 5 or more. Juvenile fish often display shoaling behaviour, and although adults are mostly solitary, they will still group together loosely at times. Tankmates must be chosen carefully - ideal companions would include peaceful fish of similar size which occupy the mid to lower levels of the tank, such as Geophagus spp., Leporinus spp., silver dollars, along with doradid and loricariid catfishes.",

In densely planted aquaria with large groups of well-conditioned B. maculatus, spawnings should occur regularly with eggs being scattered over vegetation and decor. The eggs and resultant tiny larvae will be seen as food by the adults, but if there is plenty of plant cover, some should survive into adulthood. If a greater number of fry is desired, a separate bare-bottomed breeding aquarium (with air powered sponge filter) should be set up with plenty of Java moss/spawning mops and a layer of mesh raised a small way from the tank bottom so that any eggs that fail to adhere to the plants/mops fall through to safety, away from the adults. The water conditions should match that of the main aquarium. Carefully add one or two well-conditioned pair/s of B. maculatus, and once settled they should spawn the following morning. It is recommended that the adults are moved back to the main aquarium within 48 hours as the first eggs will be starting to hatch by then. The miniscule fry will feed off their yolk sacs to begin with, but will soon require suitably sized foodstuffs such as infusoria and Paramecium, moving on to slightly bigger foods such as Artemia nauplii as they grow. A variety of foods may be needed for a while as you may end up with fry of slightly different sizes from the 2 days of continual spawning.

Spotted scats are a naturally shoaling species and can be semi-aggressive towards each other. It is best to keep a group of at least 6 specimens to ensure a natural sized group, and this usually also has the desired effect of no one single fish bearing the continuous brunt of any aggressive behaviour.

Soft, acidic water is essential, and this can be helped along with the addition of peat to the aquarium filter. Dark decor and plenty of bogwood, caves, and planting - including floating species - will all help these fish to feel secure. It is imperative that the tank has tight fitting coverslides as these fish are highly skilled jumpers; and do ensure there are no escape holes where equipment feeds into the tank (block any gaps with filter sponge). Spotted Silver Hatchetfish are a timid shoaling species, which congregate in large numbers in nature; for this reason, they must be kept in groups of 6 or more (10+ is better) in order to feel secure and display natural behaviour. Tankmates must be small and peaceful, as Spotted Silver Hatchetfish are easily intimidated. Good companions could include small-medium sized peaceable tetras, Corydoras catfish, dwarf cichlids such as Apistogramma or Mikrogeophagus, and some of the smaller Loricariidae (suckermouth catfish). Much attention must be paid to water quality since Spotted Silver Hatchets can be sensitive to elevated nitrates and swings in water chemistry.

Unless your fish are kept in a species-only tank, it would be best to set up a separate aquarium for the purposes of breeding. Soft, acidic water is essential (peat filtration is recommended). The fish should be well-conditioned on a diet of small fruitflies and black mosquito larvae, and following a lengthy courtship ritual, eggs should be laid on floating plants or plants growing near the water's surface. The parents will predate on the eggs/fry, so they should be acclimatised back to the main aquarium once spawning has ceased.

        "care": "In the wild, Spotted Skiffia are found inhabiting ditches, quiet river channels, small lakes, and spring-fed ponds. The substrate is usually composed of a mixture of mud, sand, silt, and rocks. These fish typically prefer relatively shallow depths of up to 1 metre. The vegetation comprises Lemna (duckweed) spp., Typha (bulrush) spp., and water hyacinths, along with plenty of green algae. Some habitats are abundant with roots of Taxodium (flood-tolerant conifers) sp., which provide excellent hiding places and opportunities to graze aufwuchs. The aquarium should be mature and well-filtered, with plenty of shady areas provided amongst aquatic vegetation and decor such as small driftwood pieces or spindly Sumatra wood, both of which could be used to good effect to simulate the maze of tree roots found in the natural environment. S. multipunctata is a fairly peaceful species, but will nip at the fins of long-finned species. They are best kept in a species tank environment, with 2 or more females to every male; this will reduce the amount of attention that any one female receives from the amorous males and will also further your chances of raising more fry. Wild populations of S. multipunctata have apparently been in some decline since the year 2000. Ichthyologist J. Lyons considers them to be endangered in the wild, now being found at only 6 of a previous 14 historical known sites; however, they have not been evaluated for IUCN red list status as yet. The fish pictured here have been commercially bred in the Czech Republic.",
        "feeding": "In nature, these fish graze mainly on aufwuchs that is growing on submerged plant stems, and also on some types of algae. They are also attracted by small insects at the water\"\u2122s surface. Try to provide a varied diet consisting of both vegetable and meaty fare, including frozen mosquito larvae, daphnia etc and blanched spinach. Over time, these fish usually accept dried foods such as flake and green/vegetable flake.",
        "breeding": "Breeding is straightforward. When spawning, the male will line up his genital opening with that of the female in order to inseminate her (the males do not possess a gonopodium, as is seen with guppies, for example). The gestation period is between 6 and 8 weeks, depending on water temperature. Sizeable, mature females may give birth to up to 20 fry, but the brood size is normally smaller than this (10-15), as the fry emerge particularly large and well developed. It is not usual for the adults to pursue the young, especially in tanks with plenty of plant cover, so it is not normally necessary to separate them. The fry are easy to feed and will take crushed flake plus small frozen foods such as baby brineshrimp, daphnia, and cyclops. Do not keep different species of Skiffia together, as hybridisation will occur.",

        "care": "The Spotted Talking Catfish is a secretive species known from slow-moving or still waters where it remains hidden under roots, rocks, and plant thickets during the day. Active by night, it emerges to feed by digging through the sediment, consuming various organic debris, insect larvae, and small benthic invertebrates.\nIt is important to provide a soft sand substrate in the home aquarium in order to protect the delicate sensory barbels, and be sure to make a good number of shady hiding places available such as slate caves, driftwood, and PVC pipes for these nocturnal fish to take refuge in during the day - as they do not enjoy bright illumination. Robust plants, including floating species, can also be utilised to help diffuse the lighting, and these will provide additional hiding places. This is a gregarious species which benefits from company of its own kind, so aim for a group of 5 or more of similar size. Adding a low wattage LED light to your aquarium (which switches on just before the main lights go out) will allow you to spend time observing them under their preferred subdued lighting. Adding some suitable \"dither fish\" to the aquarium may also encourage them to venture out a little more during the daytime, and some of the medium sized characins, barbs, rainbowfish, and peaceable cichlids make great companions. They can also be kept successfully alongside other doradids. However, be aware that Spotted Talking Catfish are micro-predators with capacious mouths which do actively hunt at night, so be sure that any tankmates are not of such a small size that they would become an easy snack, although an appetite for small snails can be a useful way of controlling nuisance species. Doradid catfish are often referred to as \"talking catfish\" on account of their ability to produce audible sounds via stridulation of the pectoral spines in their sockets and amplifying this sound through the swim bladder. Take care when moving these catfish, as the pectoral fin spines and body scutes can easily become entangled in netting, and can pierce the skin. It is best to herd the fish into a solid container rather than lifting directly from the water with a net.\nMay also be seen on sale as the Spotted Dora,or Spotted Raphael. A second species (A. albomaculatus) is occasionally seen but is impossible to tell apart without collection data or dissection.",

        "care": "The Spotted Tilapia is known from a variety of habitats including canals, coastal lagoons, lower river courses, and warm springs. Here the water may be sluggish or flowing, shallow or deep, the substrates muddy or sandy, and there is often an abundance of marginal vegetation. This is a large-growing and territorially aggressive species. Juvenile fish can be housed together, but adults are much more belligerent and do not tend to mix well with others. To house these fish to adulthood, a spacious aquarium is required. A group of youngsters may be grown on together, but they will soon require separating into single specimens or compatible pairs (aggression usually becomes apparent once the fish attain 2\"\u009d or so) and rehoming into larger quarters before serious problems arise. Putting a male fish and a female fish together at a later date does not mean they will be compatible, in fact it is quite unlikely to work - it is best to let the fish grow up together and pair up naturally. Studies on this species have shown that parental fish prefer to avoid each other and are more strongly bonded to their offspring. These fish like to dig and rearrange the d\u00c3\u00a9cor, so ensure that any large structures are stable, and definitely make use of a heater guard. These fish are big eaters, so an efficient filtration system along with regular water changes is very important in order to keep them healthy. Anything green and leafy will be regarded as a tasty snack, so if plants are desired they will have to be plastic and well weighted down or secured to the d\u00c3\u00a9cor. With regards to tankmates, it's often better to house cichlids such as these alongside large barbs, characins etc. that will not challenge them for territory. It may be possible to house Spotted Tilapia with other cichlids of similar size and temperament in a very large tank with plenty of visual barriers amongst the d\u00c3\u00a9cor. If you are fortunate enough to obtain a compatible pair, it is best to have a sturdy tank-divider to hand, in case they start to behave too pugnaciously towards one another. Materials such as egg crate (popular with coral propagators) can be used and holes provided to allow the smaller female easy access to her own area where the male can't follow. Young fish display stripes on the flanks, which change into spots as the fish matures.",
        "feeding": "Omnivorous but with a preference for green foods. Small specimens will enjoy all manner of foods including flake/green flake, cichlid pellets/granules, and frozen foods such as mosquito larvae Spirulina-enriched brineshrimp, and Mysis shrimp; adults will require larger foodstuffs such as cichlid sticks, Krill/prawns etc. But do ensure they receive ample vegetable matter such as blanched spinach, kale, lettuce, cucumber etc, and do not feed high protein foods too often.",
        "breeding": "Biparental substrate spawner. When ready to breed, an elaborate courtship ritual (including lip-locking) is followed by the fish choosing a suitable spawning site such as a smooth rocky surface, bogwood, cave, flower pot, PVC tube etc. The surface will be cleaned before the female deposits up to 3000 eggs, which the male fertilises. After spawning has finished, the female will tend to the eggs whilst the male patrols the perimeter. However, in some cases, the adults become very nasty with one another, and you may need to move the male to another aquarium. After a couple of days, the female may move the eggs to a pre-dug pit in the substrate. The eggs should hatch after approximately 3-4 days (temperature dependent) and are free-swimming a few days later. Parental care lasts until the fry are approximately 1.5-2 months old or about 2.5-3cm long. Given the huge numbers of fry produced and the limited options for homes, it's often wise to avoid rearing broods of this species.",

These fish live in a relatively shallow, slow-flowing softwater stream that is heavily shaded by the forest canopy above. As these rasboras can attain a modest size, and being fast-swimmers, they require a spacious aquarium \" ideally 4ft long or larger. They should be kept in groups of at least 6 specimens due to their shoaling nature, larger groups making them feel much more secure. The aquarium itself should be mature and darkly furnished, including plenty of bogwood and aquatic vegetation, both rooted and floating to create shady areas. The water must be very soft and slightly acidic, well-filtered and oxygenated, but not with an overpowering current. This is a peaceful species, but due to its large adult size, should not be trusted with tiny fish or fry. Long-finned tankmates are also best avoided. Ensure that the aquarium has tight fitting coverslides, as these Rasboras are expert jumpers. Sri Lankan Rainbow Rasboras are known only from a single small stream in Wilpita, and unfortunately, this stream is under great threat due to deforestation (only about 700m of the stream is currently left more or less undisturbed) so this species is considered as Endangered on the IUCN Red List.

The aquarium should be at least 6ft long and aquascaped with open expanses of sand in addition to a few rocky areas and some thickets of Vallisneria. D\u00c3\u00a9cor such as ocean rock can be used to build sturdy structures which stretch from the base of the tank to near the surface of the water. These structures should be built with the purpose of creating many crevices for the fish to explore but constructed in such a way so as to keep the rocks stable if the fish start to dig around and underneath them. Although a substrate of coral sand or Aragonite is often recommended to help to keep the water hard and alkaline, these fish feel safer and show better colours over a darker substrate. The Aragonite or coral sand can always be placed into a mesh bag and kept inside the external filter for buffering purposes. The Star Sapphire Hap is a relatively peaceful species, and these fish are sometimes observed in large shoals in their natural habitat. In the home aquarium, groups can be maintained together, ideally consisting of one male with a harem of several females. However, if the tank is particularly voluminous, multiple males can be kept together (again with several females allocated to each), but do provide them with an abundance of hiding places/visual barriers so they are able to set up individual territories. Aggression will increase when ready to spawn, so careful observation is required.

The temperature of the water should be raised to 28 \u00b0C and it must be extremely well-filtered and highly oxygenated. Provide a selection of small caves which have an entrance only marginally bigger than the fish. These can either be formed from arranging the rockwork in such a way that small, secluded crevices are created, or pre-constructed from small pieces of slate siliconed together. It is crucial that these caves are situated in an area with decent water movement. When in spawning condition, males will choose a preferred cave and defend it from any other males present, whilst at the same time, will try to entice a ripe female inside. Spawning does not always take place straight away; indeed, it can be some days before the female is ready to deposit her eggs, but the fish will remain inside the cave together during this time, the male usually blocks the entrance. Once the eggs have been laid and fertilised, the male fish often has to force the female out of the cave before he begins his parental guarding duties. The female plays no further part in brood care, but the male will be seen fanning the eggs with his pectoral fins and blocking the cave entrance from any intruders. Eggs typically number around 45 and take around a week to hatch. The fry will feed from their sizeable yolk sacs for the first few days, and after this has been consumed, they will require very regular feedings of baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii), microworms, and various small or crushed dried sinking foods. It is important that food is available to the fry at all times as they can all too easily starve but keep a very close eye on water quality when feeding constantly and perform lots of very regular but very small partial changes to keep nitrogenous waste levels as low as possible. The adults pose no threat to the fry, but other fish sharing the same tank might do. This is why many aquarists like to keep these catfish in a species-only set up, to further their chances of raising the maximum number of young.",

This is a relatively hardy killifish which will bring activity and colour to the upper levels of the aquarium. They are best maintained in a species-only situation, with 2 or more females to every male. If keeping more than one male in the same aquarium, do ensure that the tank is heavily decorated in order for rival males to retreat to safety if necessary. If tankmates are desired, West African dwarf cichlids such as Pelvicachromis or Nannochromis work well in larger tanks and prefer the lower regions of the aquarium. They are, however, not suitable for the general community. The aquarium itself should be heavily planted (include floating species) with the incorporation of plenty of bogwood. The use of botanicals such as Catappa leaves is suggested to help keep the water soft, acidic and tannin stained, all of which will help to show the fish in their best colours. Tight fitting coverslides are a must as these fish are expert jumpers. There are many different geographical colour forms, several of which have been described as nominal subspecies. Some of the wild strains include \"Akaram\", \"Akure\", \"Enugu\", \"Kluge\", \"Lafia\", \"Makurdi\", \"Nsukka\", \"Okwoga\" and \"Udi Mountain\". There are also gold and albino aquarium-bred strains. The fish pictured above is a beautiful male \"Akure\". This is an excellent introductory species for hobbyists who are just starting out into the world of killifish keeping. May also been seen on sale as Blue Lyretail or Gardner's Killifish.",

        "breeding": "A separate softwater spawning tank should be set up with dense clumps of Java moss and/or spawning mops. Gentle filtration should be used, with a peat medium wherever possible. Every few days, the moss/mops should be checked and the eggs removed to a separate container and stored at 22 \u00b0C in damp peat moss for 14-21 days (ensure the container is opaque as the eggs are light sensitive). After this time, the amber coloured eggs may be transferred to the water in a hatching tank. The length of time it will take for the eggs to hatch will vary depending on tank temperature, but this usually occurs within 48 hours. This method of incubating the eggs in warm damp peat and then wetting after two-three weeks seems to yield a much higher success rate than by simply placing the eggs directly into a water filled hatching tank. It also ensures that the majority of the eggs hatch within a couple of days of each other at the most.",

Planted areas and other hiding places should be provided for the times when these busy fish aren't out foraging through the substrate. In a family of fishes that prefer cooler temperatures, this species is one of the most suitable for keeping alongside species such as Discus that require warmth.\n  This fish is similar to the other peach-finned species Brochis haraldschultzi and H. gossei. sterbai have much rounder heads compared to the longer snouted B. haraldschultzi. Also, H. sterbai sports a pattern of white dots on a dark background on the head area, whereas C. haraldschultzi's head area has a pattern of dark spots on a light background. H. gossei is a much darker fish and like haraldschultzi, is likely to be told apart from sterbai by price alone.

        "care": "The smallest sturgeon species, Sterlet are naturally found in large rivers where they can enjoy the cool temperatures and high oxygen levels that they require. Unlike their larger cousins, they don't undertake extensive migrations and tend to dwell in deeper channels feeding on insect larvae, molluscs and other invertebrates. Young fish shelter in shallower water away from large predators.\nAll sterlets in the UK hobby are captive bred but they share the same preference for cool, flowing water with high oxygen levels. They have a shark-like swimming style and are very prone to getting tangled in blanketweed, often with fatal results. This means that a suitable pond needs to be large and uncluttered, with good filtration and strong water movement - conditions that are commonly found in koi ponds. The only snag is that sterlet don't have the same seasonal dietary demands, so they need feeding with a fairly high-protein specialised diet through the winter which may be a conflict with the needs of the koi. Orfe are perhaps the perfect companions for these fish as not only do they share the same water chemistry and temperature preferences, they share a susceptibility to chemicals found in treatments, so always check suitability before use.\nLike koi, sterlet prefer hard water and keepers in soft water areas are advised to add buffers to increase KH levels and monitor these alongside the usual parameters such as ammonia and nitrite. As these conditions favour the growth of algae, an ultraviolet clarifier is usually an essential piece of equipment to maintain the clear water that allows you to appreciate your pets.\nCurrently the status of this species' native wild relatives is critical.  As with any pet fish, it's important never to release sterlet into the wild where they can impact their wild kin.",
        "feeding": "Carnivore that requires specialist sinking foods specifically formulated for Sturgeon/Sterlets, that are high in fish meal/shrimp meal protein and easily digestible. If other fish are present in the pond, always feed them their usual food first in order to keep them occupied, then offer the specialist sinking food to the Sterlets. This will help to prevent the other fish from greedily consuming all the Sturgeon/Sterlet food before it reaches the bottom. It is very important to ensure the Sterlets are not being outcompeted at feeding time, and equally important that they receive a specially tailored diet. As Sterlets have short guts with limited capacity, a number of small feeds per day is much more beneficial than one large feed, but do be careful not to overfeed. During the autumn/winter months, Sterlets will continue to feed down to 4 \u00b0C and it is important that they continue to receive small amounts of food (even when other fish in the pond aren't feeding) in order to prevent starvation. However, do remove any uneaten food promptly.",
        "breeding": "In the wild, these fish spawn during the summer in the main, deep river channels with vigorous current and high O2 level, over stony and gravelly substrates. Post-fertilisation, the membranes of the eggs (which may number several hundred thousand) become increasingly more sticky and this allows them to adhere to the substrate when they come into contact with it. At 10-15 \u00b0C, the eggs would be expected to hatch after approximately 5-10 days, with larval development taking a further 14 days or so. Sturgeon/Sterlets do not necessarily spawn every year, because they require a very specific set of environmental conditions which are not always met.",

        "care": "The Stickleback has a wide area of natural distribution, occurring in most inland coastal waters within the northern hemisphere. Here, they are found in a variety of shallow, heavily vegetated freshwater and brackish environments, including lakes, rivers, streams, and estuaries over muddy or sandy substrates. Some populations are anadromous, spending most of their lives in saline waters, only ascending rivers in order to spawn; yet other populations spend their entire life cycles in pure freshwater. The anadromous fish tend to be larger, attaining a maximum size of around 11cm, but the freshwater fish that are suitable for housing in small ponds (or coldwater aquariums) top out at just 5cm. Sticklebacks are an ideal species for smaller ponds where no other fish are present, however, be aware that they may have a deleterious effect on insect and amphibian populations. This is due to the Sticklebacks being highly efficient micro-predators, making short work of any small eggs and larvae that they come across. Avoid keeping with larger fish, as the Sticklebacks may end up on the menu themselves. Filtration, although essential, need not be too powerful, and regular partial water changes will help to keep nitrogenous waste to a minimum. Provide an abundance of aquatic plants (marginal, oxygenating, and floating) for the fish to hide in and forage amongst. Sticklebacks are gregarious most of the time, so should be kept in good sized groups. However, they will become much more territorial when breeding, so having ample vegetation will help to diffuse any territorial disputes and break up lines of sight, as well as providing a spawning medium. May also be seen on sale as the Three-spined Stickleback.",

        "breeding": "When ready to spawn, male fish take on spectacular nuptial colouration and become much more territorial. Each male fish will then dig a pit and build a nest in it that is comprised of plant material held together with a glue-like substance known as spiggin, a glycoprotein excreted by the kidneys. Once the nest is complete, the male will perform a courtship dance consisting of zigzag movements in order to entice a female into spawning. If the female is receptive, the male will take up a head-down position to signal where the entrance to nest is, and she will enter and deposit a few hundred yellow/orange eggs. The male immediately drives her from the nest and he then enters to fertilise the eggs. The male may choose to court further females and entice them one at a time to the nest, where more eggs are laid and fertilised. Females have also been known to lay eggs in several different nests over a period of several days. The male fish guards and aerates the eggs with his pectoral fins, and hatching should occur within 7-8 days at 18 \u00b0C. Paternal care continues for several days, with the male guarding the young at the nest site, and any that stray too far are quickly sucked up into his mouth and then deposited safely back in the nest. Once the young disperse, the male will either abandon the nest or repair it for another breeding cycle.",

A number of spotted species are known in this genus and it may be that further investigation changes the designation of this species.\nIn the wild, Leporinus travel in groups foraging amongst algae and detritus in habitats dominated by waterlogged wood, rocks and leaf litter. Their aquarium should be mature and aquascaped with a sand or small-grained, smooth gravel substrate, plenty of sturdy pieces of driftwood and an open swimming space along the front of the tank. Plants are not necessary, but will make the aquarium more aesthetically pleasing; however, as these fish will devour plants, it is essential to choose robust species such as Anubias spp. and Java Fern (Microsorum) that can be tied onto the decor. Of greater importance is the use of powerful filtration (ideally provided by external canisters) and a high level of oxygenation, perhaps provided by spray-bar returns situated above the water line and/or additional powerheads. High water quality is essential for this river-dwelling species, so partial water changes should be carried out on a very regular basis in order to keep nitrogenous waste to a minimum. Sturdy, tight fitting coverslides are requisite, as these fish are accomplished jumpers.\nAlthough gregarious in the wild, Leporinus can be rather quarrelsome when maintained in small groups in aquaria and will be better in larger numbers. Some reports suggest that housing differently sized fishes together reduces bickering but most disputes are settled by threat displays and posturing. The smaller spotted species are much less aggressive than their striped relatives and are a good choice for larger communities of robust fish.

The tank must be mature and have myriad of hiding places amongst driftwood and thick vegetation, which should include floating species to help diffuse the light. Filtration should be good but water movement gentle. These peaceful shoaling fish can be rather timid, so a decent sized group of 12 or more will help them to feel more secure.

The eggs and resultant tiny larvae will be seen as food by the adults, but if there is plenty of plant cover, some should survive into adulthood. If a greater number of fry is desired, a separate bare-bottomed breeding aquarium (with air powered sponge filter) should be set up with plenty of Java moss/spawning mops and a layer of mesh raised a small way from the tank bottom so that any eggs that fail to adhere to the plants/mops fall through to safety, away from the adults. The water conditions should match that of the main aquarium. Carefully add one or two well-conditioned pair/s of B. naevus, and once settled they should spawn the following morning. It is recommended that the adults are moved back to the main aquarium within 48 hours as the first eggs will be starting to hatch by then. The miniscule fry will feed off their yolk sacs to begin with, but will soon require suitably sized foodstuffs such as infusoria and Paramecium, moving on to slightly bigger foods such as Artemia nauplii as they grow. A variety of foods may be needed for a while as you may end up with fry of slightly different sizes from the 2 days of continual spawning.

        "breeding": "A separate unlit aquarium should be used for breeding purposes, as killifish eggs are light sensitive. This tank should be at least 18\"\u009d in length and like the main tank should be well covered. The water should be very soft (dH < 6 degrees, pH: <6.0) and the temperature kept within the preferred range. Higher temperatures may either cause the fish to cease spawning or result in the eggs not developing. A gentle air-driven sponge filter should be used, and the aquarium furnished with floating plants and spawning mops. Best results are obtained when the sides, back and base of the aquarium are covered with a dark material (black aquarium background is ideal) and the tank positioned somewhere that does not receive a lot of natural light. The use of Blackwater Extract can help to impart a tea-coloured tinge to the water, which also reduces the light level. Before the spawning attempt is made, it is a good idea to condition the males and females separately and in aquaria with a slightly lower temperature to that of the spawning tank. When ready, carefully acclimatise 1 male and 2 or 3 females across to the breeding aquarium. Spawning will take place near to the surface of the water, with eggs laid one at a time and which attach to the spawning mops or floating plants via an adhesive thread. Up to 50 eggs per female may be laid per day (although 20 is more of an average), with the spawning process typically occurring over two weeks. In most cases, the adults do not prey on the eggs if well fed, so they can be left in the spawning aquarium until you see fit to remove them. However, if you do wish to move the eggs to another rearing tank, they are surprisingly robust and can be hand-picked off the mops/plants. It is actually very wise to intervene after 5 days or so, removing the fish so that the females may be rested and brought back into condition. The addition of an anti fungal product to the tank containing the eggs is recommended at this point, and remember to keep the tank in darkness. If any eggs do start to fungus (turn white and fluffy) remove them as soon as possible with a pipette in order to prevent it from spreading to other eggs. The eggs can be expected to hatch after 14 days (temperature dependant) and once their yolk sacs have been consumed, the fry may be started on tiny foodstuffs such as infusoria. Ensure frequent partial water changes are carefully carried out (match the temperature, pH and hardness of the new water to that of the old).",

        "care": "The Striped Headstander has a wide distribution throughout the Amazon and Orinoco River basins, and is known from rocky areas with rapidly flowing waters. Adults congregate in sizeable shoals and may be observed feeding on crustaceans, insects, plant matter, and worms. These fish attain a moderate size and require a spacious aquarium that measures at least 4ft x 18\" x 18\" (and preferably larger). Juveniles grow very quickly and should be given space from the outset in order to prevent stunting and associated health problems. The aquarium should be mature and aquascaped with a sand or small-grained, smooth gravel substrate, plenty of sturdy pieces of driftwood and an open swimming space along the front of the tank. Plants are not necessary, but will make the aquarium more aesthetically pleasing; however, as these fish will devour plants, it is essential to choose robust species such as Anubias spp. and Java Fern (Microsorum) that can be tied onto the decor. Of greater importance is the use of powerful filtration (ideally provided by external canisters) and a high level of oxygenation, perhaps provided by spray-bar returns situated above the water line and/or additional powerheads. High water quality is essential for this river-dwelling species, so partial water changes should be carried out on a very regular basis in order to keep nitrogenous waste to a minimum. Sturdy, tight fitting coverslides are requisite, as these fish are accomplished jumpers. Although gregarious in the wild, Striped Headstanders can be rather quarrelsome when maintained in small groups in aquaria. For this reason, it is necessary to keep either a single specimen, or a group of at least 8 individuals together (introduced simultaneously), as then any belligerent behaviour will be spread throughout the shoal, and no one fish will bear the continual brunt of any aggression. Tankmates could include medium-large sized peaceful cichlids (particularly rheophilic species), medium-sized characins, talking catfish (doradids) and suckermouth catfish (loricariids). Small fish will be eaten, and long-finned species will be nipped at, so choose tankmates with care. Anostomus anostomus is classified within the Family Anostomidae (headstanders), of which there are currently some 156 described species within 14 genera.

Tangles of driftwood can also be added to give additional shelter. Striped Panchax are accomplished jumpers, so it is essential that the tank has tight fitting coverslides. These fish are predatory and have surprisingly wide mouths (view them head-on). Therefore they should never be combined with small community fish e.g. Neon Tetras, as these will soon become a snack.

Active by night, it emerges to feed by digging through the sediment, consuming various organic debris, insect larvae, and small benthic invertebrates. It is important to provide a soft sand substrate in the home aquarium in order to protect the delicate sensory barbels, and be sure to make a good number of shady hiding places available such as slate caves, driftwood, and PVC pipes for these nocturnal fish to take refuge in during the day - as they do not enjoy bright illumination. Robust plants, including floating species, can also be utilised to help diffuse the lighting, and these will provide additional hiding places. This is a gregarious species which benefits from company of its own kind, so aim for a group of 5 or more of similar size. Adding a blue moon light to your aquarium (which switches on just before the main lights go out) will allow you to spend time observing them under their preferred subdued lighting. Adding some suitable \"\u02dcdither fish\"\u2122 to the aquarium may also encourage them to venture out a little more during the daytime, and some of the medium sized characins, barbs, rainbowfish, and peaceable cichlids make great companions.

However, be aware that Striped Talking Catfish are micro-predators with capacious mouths which do actively hunt at night, so be sure that any tankmates are not of such a small size that they would become an easy snack. Doradid catfish are often referred to as \"talking catfish\" on account of their ability to produce audible sounds via stridulation of the pectoral spines in their sockets and amplifying this sound through the swim bladder. Take care when moving these catfish, as the pectoral fin spines and body scutes can easily become entangled in netting, and can pierce the skin. It is best to herd the fish into a solid container rather than lifting directly from the water with a net.

        "care": "Sturgeon is the common name given to any of the 25 species of primitive fishes belonging to the family Acipenseridae, which inhabit the subtropical and sub-Arctic coastlines, lakes, and rivers of Eurasia and North America. This family is further split into two sub-families, together comprising 4 genera: Acipenser, Huso, Pseudoscaphirhynchus, and Scaphirhynchus. The earliest fossil records of Sturgeon date back to the Triassic period, some 250-200 million years ago, and their morphological characteristics remain largely unchanged. All species of Sturgeon grow very large, and are known to live for decades, with sexual maturity typically being reached between 10 and 20 years. The body is elongate and scaleless, with 5 rows of angular bony plates (scutes) providing armour. The rostrum is flattened, and the caudal fin is heterocercal, meaning the vertebrae extend into the upper lobe of the tail, making the top lobe longer than the lower - as is often seen in sharks.\nWhen it comes to keeping Sturgeon in a pond, there are many specialist requirements that need to be addressed if they are to thrive long-term. It may seem obvious, but it is extremely important to provide these fish with as large a pond as possible from the outset if they are to reach their full growth potential through exercise gained by swimming. The pond should be at LEAST 4ft/1.2m deep (6ft/1.8m or more is better) and also as long and wide as possible to give a large surface area for oxygen exchange. Ideally the floor will be mostly flat without too many sloping areas, in order that the Sturgeon may feed easily. Sturgeon have a toothless, vacuum-like mouth on the underside of the head, with 4 sensory barbels and taste buds on the outside of the mouth. The mouth is set back from the tip of the long rostrum, and as they generally like to run the barbels and taste buds over the substrate in search of food that has sunk to the bottom, this non-visual feeding behaviour will be facilitated by as generous a flat pond floor as possible. Whilst these fish are native to colder climates, it is also important to consider the depth of the pond because of seasonal temperature fluctuations; rapid changes in temperature (rather than gradual changes) may distress the fish. The deeper your pond is in proportion to the surface area, the less susceptible it will be to swings in temperature. A larger volume of water is also, of course, much more stable in terms of water parameters than a smaller one. A pond heater is definitely worth considering for the winter months for those in colder climes as it will help keep temperatures more steady. There is much that should be planned out thoroughly beforehand, such as location, size, shape (formal or non-formal design), materials (liner, concrete etc), and the need for oversized filtration (gravity fed/pump fed etc) and a power supply. A vital consideration for a healthy pond is choosing a suitable location. Try and choose an area that is of south/west aspect and which is in medium shade, receiving approximately 4-6 hours of sunshine per day. An unshaded north facing garden is far from ideal. Ensure the site is not directly under the shade of trees as falling leaves, and the invasive root system of some species can become a problem. Sufficient area must be left for a large filtration system (with a size at least 1/3 the surface area of the actual pond), and this is an area that shouldn't be overlooked in the haste to construct the pond. A filtration system cannot be too big but it can cause a lot of problems if it is too small! Experts are always on hand at your local Maidenhead Aquatics to discuss your options when it comes to filtration for a large Sturgeon pond. Other aspects to think about are whether you wish to incorporate some form of waterfall or fountain, which will aid aeration during warmer days. Sturgeon have an enormous requirement for dissolved oxygen, and you will need to consider additional aeration for the pond during the summer when the water temperature rises and dissolved oxygen levels decrease. Extra pumps/powerheads will help to incorporate more oxygen (ensure the surface of the water is rippling in places), and a hefty pond air pump is an essential piece of kit to have on hand in the case of an emergency. Once the pond has been constructed, it should be filled with dechlorinated tap water (rain water is unsuitable for the first fill as it lacks the necessary minerals).\nUnlike other ornamental ponds, the Sturgeon pool should not contain plants. This is because they can easily become entangled in overgrown vegetation, with possible disastrous consequences due to being unable to reverse because of their fixed, paddle-like pectoral fins. The same applies to outbreaks of blanketweed, which must be kept in check to avoid these clumsy swimmers from becoming caught up. Even the largest of specimens can struggle to free themselves from the these surprisingly strong threads. So prevention is key when it comes to blanketweed: ensure the filtration is oversized, that the pond does not receive too much direct sunlight, that the fish are not being overfed, and that regular partial water changes (not just top ups!) are being carried out. Regular partial water changes help to reduce nitrate (which feed algae) and will replace essential minerals. We would recommend that the pond water is tested on a weekly basis as this will alert you to the first sign of any problems. UV clarifiers can help if green water becomes an issue; this can look rather unsightly and make viewing the fish difficult. Not only will this spoil your enjoyment, but any fish that might have injured itself or is suffering from parasites, for example, will remain hidden from your attention. Ensure that you do not overstock your pond, making sure you allow for the eventual size of your Sturgeon, and always quarantine new purchases. Please be aware that many pond treatments are unsuitable for use when Sturgeon are present, due to their scaleless skin - this includes most algaecides and a number of medications (particularly those based on copper or formaldehyde). Always check with the manufacturer before use.\nCurrently the status of this species' native wild relatives is critical.  As with any pet fish, it's important never to release sturgeon into the wild where they can impact their wild kin.",
        "feeding": "Carnivore that requires specialist sinking foods specifically formulated for Sturgeon, that are high in fish meal/shrimp meal protein and easily digestible. If other fish are present in the pond, always feed them their usual food first in order to keep them occupied, then offer the specialist sinking food to the Sturgeon. This will help to prevent the other fish from greedily consuming all the Sturgeon food before it reaches the bottom. It is very important to ensure the Sturgeon are not being outcompeted at feeding time, and equally important that they receive a specially tailored diet. As Sturgeon have short guts with limited capacity, a number of small feeds per day is much more beneficial than one large feed, but do be careful not to overfeed. During the autumn/winter months, Sturgeon will continue to feed down to 4 \u00b0C and it is important that they continue to receive small amounts of food (even when other fish in the pond aren't feeding) in order to prevent starvation. However, do remove any uneaten food promptly.",
        "breeding": "In the wild, these fish are known to undergo long migrations, spawning during the summer in the main, deep river channels with vigorous current and high O2 level, over stony and gravelly substrates. Post-fertilisation, the membranes of the eggs (which may number several hundred thousand) become increasingly more sticky and this allows them to adhere to the substrate when they come into contact with it. At 10-15 \u00b0C, the eggs would be expected to hatch after approximately 5-10 days, with larval development taking a further 14 days or so. Sturgeon do not necessarily spawn every year, because they require a very specific set of environmental conditions which are not always met.",

Here this predatory species lurks amongst submerged roots during daylight hours, and emerges in the evening to feed. This is a sizeable catfish with a delicate elongated snout which can easily become permanently damaged/upturned in cramped quarters. However, this is entirely preventable by providing a voluminous aquarium from the outset, at least 8ft long and 2ft wide (if not bigger), to inhibit the fish from accidentally harming itself when swimming at speed. Spacious quarters will also allow the fish to flex its long maxillary barbels (which exceed the length of the body). Powerful filtration is requisite, as is brisk water movement and a decent level of oxygenation. Substrate should consist of soft sand in order to protect the lengthy sensory barbels. There should be at least one large shelter for each fish to take refuge in during daylight hours, and these can be fashioned from sizeable pieces of bogwood, large slates, wide bore PVC tubing etc. Provision should also be made for a roomy swimming space along the front of the aquarium for the fish to use into the night. Lighting should be fairly dim. Some aquarists like to add a blue moon light timed to come on just before the main lights switch off. This way you can observe your catfish into the evening under their preferred subdued/moonlit conditions. Sturgeon Catfish are voracious eaters that produce a fair amount of waste, and require excellent water conditions at all times. Frequent partial water changes are essential as they will not tolerate an elevated nitrate level. Sturgeon Catfish are moderately territorially aggressive towards their own kind and similar-looking bottom-dwellers, but can usually be kept in groups successfully, especially if housed in sizeable aquaria with plenty of visual barriers.

A pair of these delightful dwarf cichlids are suitable for community aquariums measuring 36\"\u009d or longer. Larger groups should be given much more territory. The substrate should consist of natural coloured sand or fine gravel, and dark shady areas should be provided with plenty of plants, driftwood, and caves. Java moss covered coconut shells or clean new flowerpots are particular favourite hideaways, and a pair is likely to choose such a location as a spawning site. Excellent water quality should be maintained at all times, and boisterous tankmates are not advised. Good companions could include small barbs, characins, Corydoras catfish, gouramis, small Loricariids (suckermouth catfish), rainbowfish, or rasboras. If kept in cramped quarters, breeding pairs will become quite aggressive towards their tankmates, so adequate space must be provided. May also be seen on sale as Ocellated Kribensis.

An upturned flowerpot (new and clean) is always well accepted as a cave substitute, as are coconut shell caves that are sometimes available from your local aquatics store. Ideally, the water will be slightly soft and acidic. When ready to spawn, the female will show off her brightly coloured belly to the male, often curling her body and quivering in front of him. Once inside the cave, the female will lay between 50 and 200 eggs on the ceiling of the cave structure, which are attached by small threads. The female will look after the eggs, fanning them with her pectoral fins, whilst the male will guard the perimeter of the cave. After 2-3 days, the eggs should hatch, and after a further 6-7 days the fry will become free-swimming. The parents will take great care of the fry, herding them around the tank in a shoal. The young can be fed newly hatched brineshrimp or finely powdered fry foods, and will grow quickly.",

Sadly, it is usually only juvenile specimens which seem to exhibit this trait - adults becoming less interested in algae eating and more interested in terrorising the other occupants of the tank. Slow-moving fish will become the focus of this species attention, where it often latches on and causes damage with its sucking-disc. These Sucking \"Loaches\", which are in fact not actually a real loach species, usually come with a temptingly low price tag; however, there are far better options to choose from if an algae-eating fish species is desired: e.g. Bristlenose catfish, Clown plecostomus, Amano shrimp, Garra sp., Siamese Flying Fox (Crossocheilus siamensis) etc. When maintaining Sucking \"Loaches\", a spacious aquarium should be provided due to the eventual large adult size of this species. In the wild, its sucking-disc allows it to keep position in fast streams and rivers whilst feeding on the algae for the micro-organisms it contains, at the same time taking on water for gas exchange through spiracles located at the top of the gill covers. As these fish inhabit flowing waters, a corresponding fast flow rate and smooth rockwork/cobbles are much appreciated in the aquarium. Tankmates should be robust and fast-swimming. Adults can be very territorial when housed together (or when housed with similar-looking fish), so ensure enough space and hiding places are provided. To minimise interspecific aggression, keep individually or else in a large group; low numbers (e.g. 2 or 3 specimens) can result in certain individuals becoming constantly harassed. Plant cover will be appreciated, although again, opt for the hardier species, as these fish will destroy delicate and softer leaved vegetation.

        "care": "The Sulawesi Red Line Shrimp is known from the hard, bio-film covered substrates of Lake Towuti, and to a lesser extent in the adjacent Lake Mahalona. These bodies of water form part of the Malili system of freshwater lakes, five individual lakes that are, in part, connected to each other by a riverine system and which drain via the Larona River towards the west into Bone Bay (also known as the Gulf of Boni). In the clear, sunlit shallows, these shrimp typically dwell inbetween small rocks/pebbles, and in the deeper waters they colonise larger rock formations. Sulawesi Red Line Shrimps have a very attractive colour and pattern, and many are surprised to learn that these are a freshwater species. However, they require a very specific set of unusual, stable water parameters if they are to thrive, and as such, are suitable for advanced aquarists only. The aquarium should be biologically mature, with crushed coral or coral sand mixed into the regular substrate, which will help to maintain a high pH. Alternatively, some people like to keep a small bag of aragonite in the filtration system for this purpose. For best results, Reverse Osmosis (RO) water should be used, and re-mineralised with specialist freshwater minerals to the desired hardness (one manufacturer even produces special \"Sulawesi minerals\" which will take the water to a specific hardness and pH). Filtration and water movement should be gentle, and great care must be taken with water changes, as these shrimps are so delicate, and extremely sensitive to swings in water chemistry. We would suggest you change around 10% at a time, on a regular basis. Some aquarists like to prepare the fresh water in a bucket containing some aragonite, a heater, and some form of gentle aeration, such as an airstone or small powerhead. Test this water prior to making a partial water change, to ensure the parameters match that of the main aquarium as closely as possible. The aquarium water should be maintained at a steady temperature, somewhere between 27-29 \u00b0C. This is warmer than the average tropical aquarium, and it must be noted that these shrimps will not fare well below 27 \u00b0C. Some aquatic plants may be included in the set up, but take care not to overplant, as these shrimp prefer hard substrates to explore; indeed, the tank is best aquascaped with plenty of rocky structures and crevices that the shrimps can congregate upon and between. Because an established tank with plenty of bio-film cover is essential, these shrimp must never be added to newly cycled aquaria, as they simply will not survive. Many aquarists have had very good results with setting up a tank and gradually introducing some small fish, then after some months when the surfaces are coated with natural bio-film and aufwuchs, the fish are moved to another aquarium, and the shrimp carefully acclimatised to the mature setting. Of course it is essential to keep nitrates to a minimum through regular partial water changes so that these are negligible when the shrimps are introduced. It may be difficult to source fish that are suitable in size (i.e. do not pose a threat to the shrimp or any shrimplets) and which also enjoy the same specialist conditions. Some of the fish currently exported from the same habitat include a plethora of medium sized gobies, and unfortunately, these would prey upon the shrimps. A very good choice of tankmates would be some of the peaceful Rabbit/Elephant Snails (Tylomelania spp.), a fascinating livebearing species which inhabit the same ancient lakes. Sulawesi Red Line Shrimps are gregarious and non-aggressive, and should be maintained in colonies of 6 or more (10+ is  better). They are not shy and will spend a great deal of time in view, constantly foraging on the rocks and other bio-film covered surfaces, using their bright white chelipeds to pick at the surfaces. If Tylomelania snails are present, they will even sit on the snail's shells, picking at the bio-film that has formed on them (the snails do not mind). It is important that the shrimp are not fed too much protein as this can cause health problems (see feeding section, below). Acclimatise very carefully, using the drip method over a couple of hours, keeping the temperature stable. Unfortunately, as with other species from the Malili lakes system, Sulawesi Red Line Shrimps are at great risk from the pollution of nearby nickel mining, as well as from introduced/invasive species such as Nile Perch and Flowerhorn Cichlids. These shrimps may also be seen on sale as Matano Red Line Shrimps or Red Line Bee Shrimps. Not suitable for beginners, and even experienced aquarists should have test kits and a TDS meter on hand for ongoing responsible maintenance of this species.",
        "feeding": "Sulawesi Red Line Shrimps are best fed just once per day, and only with an amount of food that they can finish within a couple of hours. Excess feeding can cause premature death and/or result in water quality problems. In a mature setting (as recommended for the shrimps' wellbeing), the odd missed day of feeding will be fine, as there will be plenty of natural foodstuffs for them to scavenge upon. Offer shrimp pellets/granules, algae wafers, crushed green flake, and vegetable matter. Avoid feeding protein-rich foods.",
        "breeding": "Sulawesi Red Line Shrimps have bred in the home aquarium. Reproduction takes place in freshwater, and there is no larval stage. The female carries up to 30 eggs which are released as tiny shrimplets that immediately assume a benthic lifestyle. The young are miniatures of the adults and show a fair degree of red striped patterning at a very early age.",

        "care": "The beautiful rabbit snails from Sulawesi make fascinating additions to the home aquarium. These inquisitive gastropods from the genus Tylomelaniahave been found in numerous different colour forms and many are still awaiting formal description. The long, ridged, conical shells vary in appearance, as does the colour of the snail's bodies, which can be anything from bright orange (as seen here), yellow, cream, black with yellow or white dots, black with yellow tentacles, and other combinations in between. The eyes are small and set underneath the tentacles on the long, tactile snout. The areas that these snails inhabit in the wild have a slightly unusual set of water parameters, in that the water is soft, yet alkaline. This can be a little tricky to recreate the aquarium, and many aquarists opt for keeping them in steady conditions too far off the natural parameters but in slightly harder, alkaline water. Of much more importance seems to be their temperature requirements; these nails need warm water. The water temperatures in Sulawesi vary slightly from island to island but never drop below 26 \u00b0C even during the wet season, so ensure that these balmy conditions are maintained in the aquarium. These snails are great for peaceful community tanks containing small warm-water species of fish and shrimp, and they will often breed if conditions are to their liking. Avoid keeping them in aquaria that contain loaches, pufferfish, any large/aggressive fish, and any pushy species that will outcompete the snails for food; these snails cannot survive on leftovers alone. Ensure the tank is well filtered/oxygenated and that regular partial water changes are carried out, at the same time carefully siphoning away any mulm that can accumulate from the snail's waste products. Acclimatize them carefully, as you would do for fish, and you should find that they soon begin exploring their surroundings. Some of the snails come from areas with hard substrates, and some from softer substrates, so try to provide both options in the aquarium. Sand is much preferred over gravel and is easier to keep clean. Additionally, some species will munch on soft-leaved plants, and some won't, so if in doubt, choose robust greenery, however, be sure to leave large areas free of vegetation so that the snails can move around with ease. Their rather unique, jerky fashion of locomotion is fascinating to watch, as they heave their large shells along behind them. Tylomelania snails do not particularly enjoy bright lighting so be sure to create numerous shady hidey holes with the arrangement of the decor and diffuse any strong light with floating plants. Never use treatments containing copper in the snail aquarium. May also be seen on sale as Elephant Snails.",

        "breeding": "Sulawesi Snails are ovoviviparous and have bred in the home aquarium. During fertilization, the male passes a spermatophore to the female.

RabbitSnails do not produce huge broods, often releasing one sizeable youngster at a time as they become ready, at intervals.",

It belongs to the Peacock group of cichlids and is found in the intermediate zone, where it feeds on sand-dwelling invertebrates. The aquarium should be at least 4ft long and aquascaped with open expanses of sand in addition to a few rocky areas. Decor such as ocean rock can be used to build sturdy structures which stretch from the base of the tank to near the surface of the water. These structures should be built with the purpose of creating many crevices for the fish to explore but constructed in such a way so as to keep the rocks stable if the fish start to dig around and underneath them. Although a substrate of coral sand or Aragonite is often recommended to help to keep the water hard and alkaline, Peacocks feel safer and show better colours over a darker substrate. The Aragonite or coral sand can always be placed into a mesh bag and kept inside the external filter for buffering purposes. This is a relatively peaceful species (as far as Malawi cichlids are concerned), however, whilst it may be tempting to add more of the colourful males than females to your setup, this is unnatural for a Peacock colony and will result in territorial disputes and stress. The ideal combination would be one or two males with a larger group (5+) of females. This species can be kept successfully alongside midwater Haps such as Copadichromis, Cyrtocara, Placidochromis etc and some of the more easygoing Mbuna (such as Labidochromis caeruleus).

They will circle each other in a head to tail manner a number of times, until the female deposits her eggs. These are deposited just one or two at a time and after doing so, she immediately turns around and picks them up. At the same time, the male will rotate so that he is almost on his side, at the same time shaking and extending his anal fin, releasing his milt. The female sees the egg spots on the male's anal fin and attempts to pick up those \"eggs\" whilst she is picking up the real ones that she deposited, and at the same time taking in milt. This is the method of fertilisation, and this ritual may go on for some hours. The eggs may be incubated for around 3 weeks until they hatch and the resultant fry held for a further few days afterwards. Typical brood size numbers around 50.",

These minuscule shoaling fish are known from slow-flowing, blackwater streams and pools with very low pH and negligible hardness, in ancient peat swamp forests. They tend to inhabit the deeper, cooler water layers in the lower half of the water column, fairly close to the bottom. Observations have found that they much prefer shady waters and are found only in areas that are shielded beneath the forest canopy, being absent from more open areas that are exposed to direct sunlight. These fish are an ideal choice for small, heavily planted aquaria. The tank must be mature and have a myriad of hiding places amongst driftwood and thick vegetation, which should include floating species to help diffuse the light. Broad-leaved plants can be beneficial to encourage spawning(see below). Filtration should be efficient, but water movement gentle. It is highly recommended that RO water is used and this is filtered through aquarium peat to help reduce the pH. The addition of Dried Indian almond leaves (Terminalia catappa) or blackwater extract could also be advantageous. The tannins released will impart a natural tea colour to the water; this will not be harmful to the fish, and in fact will result in them showing their most intense colours. These peaceful fish can be rather timid, so a decent-sized group of 12 or more will help to give them confidence. They are really best off housed in a species tank environment, but if tankmates are a necessity, ensure that they are also small and placid; for example, small Caridina/Neocaridina shrimps or Eel loaches (Pangio spp.). Much attention must be paid to water quality since Paedocyprisprogenetica are somewhat delicate and do not tolerate elevated nitrates or swings in water chemistry. Acclimatise very carefully.

When spawning territories have been established, the male fish will position itself in an inverted position under the leaf, its belly facing the underside of the vegetation(his abdomen will be in contact with the leaf, but his caudal and pectoral fins will not be). He will remain in this position for a time, occasionally moving slightly up and down, and then after a short interval, and often when females are in the close vicinity, he will detach himself from the leaf and resume the normal swimming position, before darting back into place beneath the leaf (this repeats every couple of seconds). When he swims back to the underside of the leaf, he positions himself so that an iridescent spot on his head faces the female. Eventually, a willing female will join the male at the same spot underneath the leaf, also inverted and positioned side by side with him. Mating is extremely quick and the exact method is not yet clear. Single spherical, translucent, adhesive eggs are deposited on the underside of the leaf, and these take approximately 30 hours to hatch at 27 \u00b0C. Newly hatched larvae are minuscule, measuring just 1.3mm in length, and lie motionless, attached to the underside of the leaves or on the sides of the aquarium glass. Raising the mini sculefry is extremely challenging because of the microscopic foodstuffs required.",

        "care": "The Sumo Loach is known from clear, well-oxygenated, shallow, fast-flowing waters of headwaters, tributaries, and high-gradient streams. Here there is usually a forest canopy overhead, and a substrate of sand, smooth gravel, and water-worn rocks and boulders. Aquatic plants do not usually feature in these habitats, although in some areas there may be a little marginal vegetation. These delicately-coloured torpedo shaped loaches are members of a group of bottom dwellers referred to as Brook Loaches, and they occupy a similar, but not quite so harsh niche to that of the balitorids (Hillstream Loaches). Nemacheilidae is a huge and diverse family, currently containing over 450 species and is comprised of many popular genera including Aborichthys, Acanthocobitis, Mesonoemacheilus, Nemacheilus, Schistura, and Yunnanilus. A requisite for their care is highly oxygenated water with plenty of current, and tight fitting coverslides are a must. The Sumo Loach is highly territorial and must be kept in spacious aquaria with plenty of \"\u02dcvisual barriers\"\u2122 amongst the d\u00c3\u00a9cor. Their antagonistic behaviour is not so much of an issue in the wild, where fish can easily move from one territory to another, but it can certainly present problems within the confines of the aquarium. Provide a sandy substrate along with plenty of nooks and crannies formed from pebbles, rocks, pieces of slate, and tangles of driftwood - ensuring that lines of sight are broken up. As mentioned above, plants are not found in any great abundance in the fast-flowing waters of the natural habitat of the Sumo Loach, so are not considered essential; however, robust species such as Anubias and Microsorum tied onto driftwood will help with water quality and will make the aquarium look more aesthetically pleasing, as well as creating more hiding places. The best way to keep these loaches is either singly, as a known compatible pair, or in dense groups (10+). Keeping just 3 or 4 can result in carnage with specimens being lost. Sumo Loaches do not usually show aggression towards other current-loving fish, providing that they are not other nemacheilids. Nonetheless, small placid tankmates are best avoided, as are species with long fins. Good companions could include some of the smaller Barbs, Barilius/Opsarius, temperate Bitterlings, Crossocheilus, Danios, Devarios or Garras, and shoals of these will act as 'dither fish', encouraging the loaches out into the open. Like other species that inhabit fresh running waters, these loaches will not tolerate a build-up of nitrates within the aquarium and require excellent water conditions at all times if they are to thrive - so powerful filtration and regular partial water changes are essential. Imports of this species are sporadic, with shipments of the closely related and much more colourful Tri-Band Sumo Loach (Schistura cf. balteata) becoming increasingly popular since late 2006. The true Sumo Loach (S. balteata) is diagnosed by the following combination of characters: unique colour pattern consisting of 2-3 dark vertical bars below the dorsal fin, 3-5 pairs of round spots in front of the dorsal fin along the back, and an absence of a black basal caudal mark. The Tri-Band Sumo Loach (S. cf. balteata) on the other hand, has orange, pink, or yellow vertical bars (that don't always directly correspond with the colour of the posterior half of the body), and a black basal caudal mark that extends the full caudal fin base.",

These shrimp are highly social creatures and are best kept in large colonies. They are suitable for aquariums containing communities of small, peaceable fish only, as larger tankmates will regard them as a snack. Sunkist Orange Shrimp are excellent algae eaters and will browse on many different algae types. Highly recommended for planted aquaria, they will not damage the plants, but instead, large groups of this species will keep the leaves free from algae. Floating plants seem to be particularly favoured, and these shrimp can often be seen 'hanging around' in the plant cover near the water's surface. Like most species of shrimp, a high nitrate level will not be tolerated; ensure high standards of water quality are maintained at all times. Sunkist Orange Shrimp will moult regularly whilst growing, and the sudden appearance of perfectly formed shrimp casings on the floor of the aquarium can cause alarm to fishkeepers who have not seen this before. Once the shrimp has moulted, it will remain hidden for a time until the new shell hardens and it has a bit more protection. Capable of fairly dramatic colour change, depending on substrate, water parameters, and mood. May also be seen on sale as Orange Shrimp, Borneo Orange Shrimp, Orange Pumpkin Shrimp, and Tangerine Shrimp. This species is sometimes confused with a similar-looking orange variant of the Cherry Shrimp.

Ideally, a separate small aquarium should be set up with water from the main tank, with gentle air driven filtration and clumps of Java Moss. A berried female should then be very gently caught and moved across. Once the female releases her eggs, she should be moved back to the main tank. Aquarium salt should then be carefully added to the breeding tank, gradually bringing the salinity of the water up to an SG of 1.008. The larvae take between 21-30 days to transform into young shrimps, and during this time, should be fed miniscule foods such as infusoria and Liquifry. Once they have grown to an acceptable size, they can be very cautiously acclimatised back to freshwater.",

This species has a delicate beauty and is of a shy, peaceful disposition. It is best maintained in groups of 6 or more of its own kind (10+ is better) due to a naturally shoaling nature; indeed, the larger the group, the more confident they will feel. The aquarium should emulate the natural conditions as closely as possible, with slightly cooler-than-average water temperature and a moderate flow rate with a good level of oxygenation. Flat stones, pebbles, cobbles, slate, and smooth driftwood pieces can all be used to achieve a stream bed effect, and robust or fast-growing plant species could be cultivated along the back and sides, leaving an open swimming space along the front. Frequent partial water changes are a must, as this species does not appreciate elevated nitrate levels. Tankmates should be of a similar peaceful temperament, but do avoid species with long fins as they may prove too much of a temptation. Do not house with boisterous species. Unfortunately the Sunset Barb is not exported very often, but given its charm, is well worth looking out for. For years, this fish was misidentified in the trade as the Narayani Barb (P. narayani).

A conditioned group (3 females, 2 males) should then be acclimatised across to the breeding aquarium, which should be furnished with plenty of fine-leaved plants/Java moss clumps. After a time, a male will swim in front of a female, displaying to her. He will then begin to drive the female over the plants, utilising the whole length of the tank. The relatively large eggs will be scattered over the plants a few at a time. These fish are known as 'continual spawners' which means that the spawning activity takes place over several days/weeks. This can present problems to the aquarist in that some adult fish may begin to consume the eggs as they are scattered, although this may not be a problem if the adults are kept well fed. However, many fishkeepers have found the eggs to be remarkably tough and have had great success in siphoning them out into another aquarium (containing matching water from the spawning tank) or else using spawning mops, which, when having caught a number of the eggs, can be moved to a separate tank (again with matching water) and replaced with a new mop, as and when each series of eggs are deposited. The eggs will usually hatch in 6-9 days (dependent on temperature) and once free-swimming, the tiny fry can be offered infusoria, moving onto larger foodstuffs as they develop.",

Here, it is found in a variety of different tropical and subtropical habitats, from canals, ditches, estuaries, lowland wetlands, ponds, rivers, streams, and swamps. These waters range from flowing to stagnant, and, this resilient fish - which is capable of air breathing - can survive dry periods by burying deep into moist soil, or, if necessary, it can even travel short distances across land to find more suitable surroundings. This is a nocturnal species that preys on crustaceans, insects, small fishes, worms, and other small aquatic animals overnight, and has even been known to take turtle eggs. The aquarium should be voluminous with a soft sandy substrate and a tight fitting, heavy hood, with no gaps left where equipment feeds into the tank (holes can be blocked tightly with oversized chunks of filter sponge). The tank should be at least long enough for the fish to stretch out fully if it chooses to, and for it to make turns with ease. It is important to ensure the aquarium is escape-proof as these fish are proficient escape artists and could potentially travel quite some distance. Provide an abundance of shady hiding places amongst driftwood, smooth rocky crevices, robust planting, and wide PVC pipes. Due to the large adult size, predatory feeding habits, and somewhat cantankerous nature, this is a fish that is best kept alone. Monopterus albus is not actually a true eel in the strictest sense. It is a Synbranchid, characterised by only having one gill opening (which facilitates oxygen exchange from the water), located on the bottom of the throat, and an absence of swim bladder and ribs. It also has no covering of scales and lacks pectoral and pelvic fins. The anal, caudal, and dorsal fins are rudimentary, reduced to skin folds. Unlike most air-breathing fish, M. albus lacks a distinct air-breathing organ, and relies on extra-branchial gas exchange using a highly vascularised epithelium (tissues that line the outer surface of blood vessels) in the buccopharyngeal cavity, as well as a vascularised oesophagus and integument (skin). The buccal cavity expands during air-breathing, remaining initially inflated during submergence, with exhalation occurring either under water or at the surface prior to the next inhalation. To sum up: this is an unusual, specialist fish for the large oddball connoisseur, but please make sure all its long-term care requirements can be met prior to purchase.",
        "feeding": "Juveniles can be offered bloodworm, vitamin-enriched brineshrimp, Mysis shrimp, and chopped krill. Adults should be offered larger foodstuffs such as cockles, earthworms, mussels, prawns, silversides, whitebait etc.",
        "breeding": "This species has not been bred in the home aquarium. In the wild, the male constructs a floating bubble nest amongst surface vegetation close to the shore.

All fry are female initially, with a certain percentage of mature fish changing sex to male. In the event of a shortage of females, male fish can revert to female once again.",

        "care": "The Swan Mussel is a large species of freshwater mussel, typically found in lowland lakes, canals, and quiet river backwaters with low current, muddy or silty substrates, and sparse vegetation. Here, these aquatic bivalve molluscs burrow into the soft substrate, leaving just their two siphon tips exposed. The siphons are tube-like structures that are positioned at the posterior edge of the mantle cavity which allow the mussel to breathe, feed, excrete, and reproduce. Water is drawn in through the inhalant siphon, and is moved over the gills for respiration. During this process, the Swan Mussel filter feeds on finely suspended particles, and the water is then forcefully expelled through the narrower exhalant siphon. This species is best maintained in a unfiltered wildlife pond situation, where the water quality is good but there are plenty of suspended infusoria particles. They are not recommended for clear, heavily filtered ponds, as such environments will not provide a suitable ongoing source of nutrition. Due to the specialised reproductive cycle (see Breeding section below), it is not always advisable to keep Swan Mussels alongside fish, as there is the possibility of skin damage and secondary infection. The most appropriate housing is therefore mature, unfiltered wildlife ponds with soft substrate and gentle water movement (some current is preferable in order to provide adequate dissolved oxygen, but it should not be too vigorous). It should be noted that although these bottom dwellers filter feed, they also obviously excrete waste products from this process, and will not \"clean\" the water in the same way that a filter does. They require a continuous source of nutrition and appropriate conditions if they are to thrive.",
        "feeding": "Filter feeders which require an ongoing source of infusoria within their environment.",
        "breeding": "In the wild, reproduction of the Swan Mussel depends on the presence of suitable fish hosts - usually Brown Trout (Salmo trutta), Dace (Leuciscus leuciscus), European Eel (Anguilla anguilla), Perch (Perca fluviatilis), Pike (Esox lucius), Stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), Tench (Tinca tinca), or Zander (Sander lucioperca). During the spring time, female Swan Mussels produce eggs and brood them inside specialised chambers in their gills known as marsupia. Males release their sperm into the open water, which the females draw in via their siphon. This then fertilises the eggs, which develop into parasitic larvae known as glochidia, and these are released into the water and carried by currents until they come across a suitable host. The glochidia attach themselves to the outside of the fish and then encyst, feeding off the body mucus of the fish. After several weeks, they will drop off and find a suitable place on the substrate in which to develop into adult mussels.",

More streamlined and agile than platies, swords are often found in fast-flowing habitats and appreciate cooler water and high oxygen levels. They can be kept in community aquariums where no tiny fish are present, and they will appreciate plant cover. They also make excellent companions for smaller species of Central American cichlids such as Thorichthys and Cryptoheros in large aquaria, where they can avoid intruding on spawning territories. Males can become quite competitive towards one another, so it is wise to limit yourself to one male per tank in smaller set-ups. Larger groups are best with three or more males to spread aggression, outnumbered by females. There are numerous colour variants available and the wide selection often mirrors that of platies, due to their ease of hybridisation.

The adults will predate on the fry if not separated. However, a few will normally manage to survive onto adulthood when kept in a well planted aquarium with lots of natural hiding places.

        "breeding": "This species has been bred in the home aquarium, and its method of reproduction is particularly interesting. A mixed-sex group of fish should be conditioned in soft, acidic water (pH:6.0-7.0, dH: up to 8 degrees) with water temperature towards the high end of the preferred range. At the same time as getting the adults into condition, set up another small aquarium with matching water parameters for the purpose of reading the fry. This tank should be filtered gently via an air-powered sponge filter and should contain clumps of fine-leaved plants or moss. When in spawning condition, the male fish show off to females by twitching their opercular appendages; responsive female fish that are ready to breed have been observed rubbing against these. Once this courtship behaviour has been witnessed for a few days, it is likely that the males will have deposited their sperm capsules into the oviducts of the female fish (internal fertilisation).In the wild, the females are thought to be able to retain fertilised eggs until conditions in the environment are to their liking, at which point they arereleased. So having seen this courtship behaviour unfolding in the main tank over the course of several days, the females should be carefully acclimatised to the breeding tank. Leaving the female fish in this tank for a few days should result in the appearance of tiny fry (eggs typically hatch between 24-36 hours).It is best to move the adult females back to the main tank at this point, to prevent predation. As the fry are so small, they will require appropriately sized foodstuffs for the first week or so, such as infusoria. After this they can be moved on to baby brine shrimp (Artemianauplii).",

They are generally peaceful towards other cichlids, and are often more intolerant of their own kind, particularly in smaller aquaria. Due to the large adult size of this fish (girth as well as length!), an aquarium measuring 6\" x 2\" x 2\" is required. A group of youngsters can be grown on in a 4ft tank, but in most cases they will eventually require separating into compatible pairs and rehoming into larger quarters. Excellent powerful filtration should be provided at all times and partial water changes carried out 2 or 3 times per week. The tank itself should have a substrate of sand or small rounded gravel. Bogwood and rocks/slate can be used to create sheltered areas, but these should be made secure as these cichlids are more than capable of moving decor around. Bonding pieces of rock together with aquarium grade silicon sealant prior to filing the tank is sensible. Plants are usually eaten or uprooted, but some aquarists have had success with well-rooted, established hardy mother plants which have had sturdy rocks placed around the stems to prevent uprooting. If this fails and plants are still desired, plastic or silk varieties will be the way to go. Although this species will adapt to a wide range of water conditions, they will be at their best in hard water with low nitrates - which means plenty of large water changes. Other Central American cichlids of a similar temperament make good tankmates in aquaria large enough to provide adequate territory but fast moving shoaling species will often be a better option.

They will then choose a preferred spawning site at one of the caves, digging small pits near the entrance.

When ready, the female will swim over the spawning site in a series of \"\u02dcdry runs\"\u2122, after which she will begin depositing 200-300 eggs. The male immediately follows behind her and fertilises them. The act of spawning has been known to continue for well over an hour in some cases, after which time, the female will start hovering above the eggs, fanning them with her pectoral fins. The male resumes his sentry duty, guarding the perimeter once more. It is at this time that T-Bar Cichlids are at their most aggressive, which is why, if you have a pair in a relatively small aquarium, they are best kept by themselves. However, if kept in a larger \"\u02dcmixed community\"\u2122 type setting, other fish usually cotton-on pretty quickly that it\"\u2122s best to stay well away from the protective parents and this prevents the pair taking out their protective urges on one another. After 3 or 4 days, the eggs should hatch into wrigglers, and the parents will move them into one of their prepared pits. The wrigglers will initially feed on their yolk sacs, and should become free swimming after another 4 or 5 more days. Baby brineshrimp (Artemia nauplii), microworms, or egg layer \"\u02dcfirst foods\"\u2122 should be offered at this stage, followed by crushed flake after a week or so. The parents will continue to herd them from pit to pit until they are ready to make their own way. Well fed adults do not usually prey on their young. With such a large potential brood size, you should think about methods of re-homing the young once they have attained a satisfactory size.

Without a common enemy, many cichlid pairs tend to bicker, and a threat is required in the form of target fish (which must be able to escape the defended territory to safety for their own welfare) or even a mirror attached to the outside of one of the aquarium panes. Often, the first signs that spawning is occurring is when the pair disappear for some time into one of their favourite caves. Once the eggs have been deposited and fertilised, they will take approximately 5 days to hatch and a further 3 or 4 days to become free-swimming. A typical brood size would be around 40-50 young. The parents are very defensive of the fry and will be seen herding them around the aquarium, where they will forage on live foods such as newly hatched brine shrimp and microworms. Once the young fishes are independent it\u2019s best to remove them before the adults attempt to drive them away.",

Frequent partial water changes are a must for this species, as they can be very sensitive to elevated nitrate levels. Corydoras have the ability to breathe air intestinally, so a small gap should be left between the surface of the water and the cover slides in order for the fish to come up to the surface and take air in. It may do this numerous times per day. caudimaculatus is similar in appearance to Gastrodermus guapore, Corydoras ourastigma and H. similis.\n  Hoplisoma was recently split from Corydoras and contains many familiar species.",

They should be kept in groups of 6 or more individuals and because of their active nature, the aquarium should be spacious to allow them a good amount of swimming space. As with many other Rainbowfish species, the small juveniles can look comparatively drab to the absolutely stunning adult fish, and so are all too often overlooked in the shops.

A small air-driven sponge filter (with a mature sponge) should be added to give gentle circulation and filtration. The temperature should be set at 27 \u00b0C. A conditioned pair should then be acclimatised across to the breeding aquarium, which should be furnished with plenty of fine-leaved plants/Java moss clumps. After a time, the male will begin displaying to the female. He will then begin to drive the female over the plants, utilising the whole length of the tank. The eggs will be scattered over the plants a few at a time. These fish are known as 'continual spawners' which means that the spawning activity takes place over several days, even months in some cases. This can present problems to the aquarist in that some adult fish may begin to consume the eggs as they are scattered. Alternatively, a spawning mop or clump of moss can be added to the main tank and moved to a rearing set up - note that this approach is inadvisable when housing different species together due to the very real danger of hybridisation. Many fishkeepers have found the eggs to be remarkably tough and have had great success in siphoning them out into another aquarium (containing matching water from the spawning tank). The eggs will usually hatch in 6-9 days (dependent on temperature) and once free-swimming, the tiny fry can be offered infusoria, moving onto larger foodstuffs such as baby brineshrimp and fine crushed flake foods as they develop.",

During daylight hours, this small and secretive bottom-dweller takes refuge amongst rocks, and emerges at night to feed on beetle larvae, chironomid larvae, small crustaceans, and occasional vegetable matter. The aquarium should be spacious with a soft sandy substrate in order to protect the delicate sensory barbels. It should be decorated with an abundance of rock piles and caves along with some PVC tubes and robust planting (that can cope with hard, alkaline conditions) to provide welcome shady areas. Filtration should be efficient and the water well-oxygenated with a moderate current. Frequent partial water changes are a must to help keep nitrate to a minimum. These fish are most comfortable in aquaria with subdued lighting, and the use of blue-moon type illumination is highly recommended so that you may observe a few hours of the nightly goings-on in an aquarium containing these catfish. Ensure that heaters are covered with heater guards to prevent them from being burned when looking for dark crevices to rest against. A peaceable and fairly gregarious species, L. cyclurus should be kept in groups of 5 or more. Companions should be relatively peaceful and larger than 2.5cm (1\") in length (otherwise they may be predated upon); they do well as part of a Tanganyikan community of medium-sized fish. It is believed that these catfish can exude a mucus when stressed, which is poisonous to other fish, although further study is required.

The best choice of substrate would be either coral sand or aragonite which will help to keep the water hard and alkaline. Outcrops of rocks (ocean rock or tufa rock is ideal) can be assembled here and there, but remember to leave enough open swimming space along the front of the aquarium.

Larger specimens are capable of undermining the decor, so do ensure everything is well supported and secure - many aquarists like to place the decor on the base of the aquarium prior to adding substrate around it. The footprint (length and width) of the tank is much more important than the height, and be sure there are no gaps at the top, as these fish are great escape artists.
